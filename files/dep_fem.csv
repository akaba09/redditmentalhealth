depression,2019/08/28,"The sun hasn’t even came up and I’m (27F) ready to go to bed again. So I’ve got this weird thing where I’m depressed and anxious for a few days each month (some months I’m 100% fine). But it is usually the same time each month. My guess is it is hormone related. 
Anyhow. I am so very grateful for everything I have in life. But I just can’t help the way I feel. I know it’s only temporary. But my boyfriend has left to work and I’m laying here just over whelmed with emotions and crying. I know when I get in these moods that my thinking is irrational and my worries fears or self criticism is totally warped. I am able to recognize that. I just don’t like to tell people close to me when I get this way because I know literally within a day or two it’s back to my usual self. And I know a lot of people have things going on in their own lives so I couldn’t burden them or have them label me as a sad person, because we all get sad. So I typically spend these down days self reflecting and acknowledging the sadness. 
To anyone out there, feeling down, or feeling isolated, we are all in this together. Today when I finally decide to get out of bed.... I’m going to spend my day fully present and appreciative of all the beauty around me."
depression,2019/08/28,"i am just so exhausted Im (22F) currently in an inpatient centre because i have been struggling for 8 years now, been through a misdiagnosis of BPD and finally have been diagnosed with Major depressive disorder and severe anxiety. But whatever im managing. Ive finally created a reddit account because i dont know where next to go. Im on my third week of inpatient and things were looking better, with changes in meds and an ongoing care plan of outpatient and an awesome psychiatrist.

 Then i started going downhill three days ago. Im at a point where I just don't know if it's worth it and i feel so hopeless. I feel like I don't know what to do when I get depressed. Like I can't apply any of my DBT/CBT skills or the distractions are just short lasting and i feel like i won't recover and will just have to wait until it passes - which is days or weeks, where as if my anxiety isn't manageable or I have a really bad panic attack I can have a small dose of Valium. I can't keep going on. Im just so exhausted. Im barely making it to group and all functioning has gone down (showering, routine , etc) and this is while im inpatient. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or any advice ?"
depression,2019/10/08,"Not sure if I am depressed, burnt out or if society just sucks? 26F I don’t know what my problem is lately. I think I am just stressed and burnt out and depressed. I don’t even know where to start. I worry by throwing all this out there I will just seem like a millennial brat or something. 

If this post is too long or something is wrong with my question or presentation, let me know. 

Relationship and living situation: 
Right now I live with my boyfriend renting a two family flat in a  midwestern US city. We have four cats and a dog that I adore. Our relationship is good in some ways however our issues in my eyes are that I don’t feel a spiritual deep connection or understanding with him like I would like to, he has a few addictions like porn and weed, sometimes I feel like I want him to be different than he feels he is like I don’t want him to dye his hair crazy colors or wear kilts or other different fashion, and he is mostly interested in television, celebrity actors, and games while I could care less; I spend my free time on going to yoga, doing chores, maybe watching a show, seeing my friend, hiking. He does run a lot and is struggling to find things to do in his free time. He can also be kind of lazy and messy and I take control of all the cleaning, bill paying, meal planning etc. He is a cook and went to school for it but doesn’t seem to really have a passion for it. I think I expect too much however as I feel I want a soul connection with a man but I don’t think I’ll actually find that.

Work: 
I work a bit more than full time in customer service in the automotive industry 8-5 weekdays, mainly I take about 30 calls a day and process orders etc. I have been here three years. Before this I worked in food service. They like me here and told me they consider me management material possibly and are gearing me in that direction. However I don’t really want the job, though I thought I might a while ago. Customer service is irritating and lately I have been so irritable at work. I hate answering calls with the same questions all the time. I hate working inside all day in some ways, I don’t care about the auto industry, my coworkers are usually pretty sweet but I just feel so irritable with everything about work. 

School: 
I am also going to school four hours per week doing an accelerated degree program in corporate communications. I’ll be done by summer 2020. I forgot why I even started this program. I had an associates in general transfer studies and felt I needed to finish my bachelors and picked a program that sounded interesting. I do like the material. However my managers think I’m best in customer service and think marketing is not right for me, since I am shy and quiet and not charismatic. I don’t know what I’m going to do with my degree. I just figured it would get me somewhere. 

Thoughts lately: 
This cluster in school I am studying native Americans for my electives. I am one eighth Native American approximately, one sixteenth Chippewa from my mother and maybe one sixteenth Cherokee from my father, he is unsure but I intend to research. My mother owns reservation land in Wisconsin and wants to give it to me. I really want to visit it. I have become fascinated learning more about the culture and find it so beautiful. I am sad we ever destroyed their culture. I love their spiritual ways of living, connection with the earth, community and family values, everything. I am probably romanticizing it all but I’ve just been researching and am sad I wasn’t born in a time where that kind of organic life was something I could live. I am an infp personality type and feel deeply unfulfilled living this rat race materialistic lonely depressing boxed in life. I don’t think it is a personal problem but a societal problem. I have been dreaming of a life where I could live away from the city, not work my life away in an office, live in nature, but I bet it would be lonely. Idk, I’ve had thoughts like this before about wanting to escape the regular society, just fantasizing and I probably sound like a teenager right now. I just want to live a whole life, raise strong and healthy children, not contribute to destroying the beautiful planet we’re on. 

Health: 
I recently lost 65 lbs. through calorie counting and have about 15 more to go until I’ll be done I think, however progress has stalled. I am 136 lbs and 5’7.5”. I want to lose more but can’t get my eating under control now. I think I have a freaking eating disorder. I’ve become ocd about counting calories, weighing food, constantly on my fitness pal. Lately I go over calories and binge on fast food and have gained about 3 pounds. I obsess about my bodily flaws and the fact that I am aging and there are way more beautiful women out there. I pinch my fat and hate it. I regret ever getting fat and don’t even know how I wasn’t aware of how big I was getting. I unhealthily blame my upbringing for not teaching me healthy habits. My family all smokes so many cigarettes, don’t exercise, eat lots of fast food. I was going to try to assume a deficit today but went way overboard at Starbucks and Dairy Queen. I talked to my dietician friend and she suggested intuitive eating. My life has revolved around calorie counting however lately I’ve been obsessing over how society sucks and gave me this eating disorder, self esteem and body image issues. I know I should not blame.

Family background: 
I grew up living with my dad as my parents were divorced before my birth. My mom grew up in poverty, only got a fifth grade education, and is severely ill with schizophrenia though treated today, she is still on disability. My dad was distant and not usually kind, could be abusive. My stepmom moved in when I was four and was very different from my mother. My mother is very Christian and has strong values and values religion and cleanliness. My stepmom and dad were atheists, stepmom would yell at us all the time, didn’t really care about a clean house, we lived in chaos with over a dozen pets usually. I have two step sisters who are very different from me, they are loud and tough and I am quiet and introspective. I grew up I guess emotionally neglected and have always struggled with emotional, mental, and social health. I’ve seen counselors before.

Obviously my mental and emotional health are not in a good place. I don’t know what to do. I hate my job, I wish life was different, I want to have a meaningful life and want to feel spiritually fulfilled, I feel trapped. I’m sure this sounds like a complain fest. I just have to express. Any advice?"
depression,2019/10/08,"Hi this is my first post...just wanted to talk to anyone who would listen at this point. I’m 17F and I am taking a year off from school because of my depression. I used to be someone with lots of friends and have a social image in school. I guess I was kind of popular even. But now I literally have no more friends. Everyone ditched me once I fell through with depression, making rumours about me, calling me really nasty names, my own friends told me I was too negative and some even told me to kill myself since I was so ‘emo’. The last 5 years of my life I’ve dealt with a lot of betrayal and trauma and bullying but I guess I exceeded my limit this year. It’s been 6 months since then, and I just feel very lonely and isolated. The bullying at school still haunts me to this day. I wish I had someone to talk to besides my parents (who don’t really empathise with mental illnesses in general) and my therapist. I guess I just want to start over and maybe make some friends here. I’m not looking for upvotes or anything, I’m just hoping to make a friend or maybe advice on life, and this post is me trying to reach out I guess."
depression,2018/11/07,"I(21F) felt like I had my shit together at 18, now I feel hopeless TL;DR: after facing an abusive teenage years I was able to turn my life around at 18. But now at 21 and facing no hardships or disadvantages I’m depressed. Why am I struggling with preforming such easy tasks? Has this happened to anyone else?

I’ll keep it short. I faced sexual (age 11-14), verbal (age 12-17), and physical (age 12-17) abuse in my teen years and relied heavily on alcohol. I was suffered with severe anxiety and depression (diagnosed). By the time I turned 18 I had completely turned my life around. My past experiences stoped being a limitation and I worked hard on my mental health. I worked a minimum wage job part time and studied full time. But I was completely motivated. I had drive for the future, I kept great relationships, I was a productive and healthy person, but most importantly I was happy.

Now at 21 I face no hardships or disadvantages to make living my life hard. But I’m completely depressed. I can’t finish my degree, I don’t attend at all even though I’m doing it part time. I can’t hold a job and will quit after a month or two. I have lost all passion for hobbies. Every morning I wake up I wait until it’s socially acceptable for me to take a nap, and then I do the same until I can sleep. I have no idea what the future looks like. The thought of me having to work a 9-5 the rest of my life helps me burrow deeper in my hole. 

I understand that I must work and put in effort to improve my situation, but I don’t want to. I don’t want to do anything. Why is it when I was 18 I completely changed my life after facing challenging times, now in my early adulthood when facing no hardships I’m struggling? I feel as if I don’t deserve to be depressed now and am doing my younger self a complete dishonour. Has anyone else struggled with depression on two seperate occasions? Or a similar situation? "
depression,2019/07/29,"Not sure what to do I am 26F, have a 6 month old daughter, husband, and 2 dogs. My life is great but I can't seem to be happy. Something every single day gets me down. My husband thinks I just need to ""cheer up"" but that doesn't seem to be it.

I have been diagnosed with depressive episodes, anxiety, and my mom is diagnosed bipolar. My system is VERY sensitive to pretty much anything (including caffeine and certain vitamins) so I'm scared to seek treatment but need SOMETHING.

I hate coming to work. I started nootropics 2 weeks ago but stopped because I'm not sure if they're working. I am afraid to talk to a doctor because I only antidepressants can change you and I don't want that either.

I smoke weed to calm down but I feel like crap when I'm not smoking and get mood swings because of it. I also want another baby and think it's affecting my fertility.

I don't know what I want out of life and don't understand why I feel this way."
depression,2019/07/29,"I don’t want to be here anymore I’m 19F, I’ve switched meds a lot for my anxiety and it works wonders but my depression is still so bad. I won’t go off meds because I’ve had crippling anxiety my whole life and the thought of having it back kills me I rather be dead than feel it again. I’ve been self harming and have a lot of suicidal thoughts. I’m doing terrible in college and did in high school, I can’t make friends whatsoever since I’m so awkward and I feel like a burden to everyone with how emotional I am. I just don’t know how long I can go on like this. Life is too difficult"
depression,2019/07/29,"Living with me is like dealing with a middle schooler. I (33M) have clinical depression. Due to an insurance mistake I made, my medication has been tricky this year. I have a high cost deductible this year, which means until I spend $2,300 in medical costs, I have no coverage.

This has made getting my appointments and medications tricky. Recently, I am starting to run out and have to figure out a way to pay for a $300 doctor visit or I won't be allowed any more refills.

I've been depressed and moody lately. Saturday, my girlfriend (31F) asked me to do some things around the house. I didn't say anything, but I guess she sensed I was irritatible about it. Today, she told me I had been acting like a middle schooler.

I know I'm in the wrong here. But it hurts. I've been depressed about a few things lately... We went to a friend's to watch a movie, grill, and swim, and I forgot to tell her about the pool and she was really upset. I apologized four times. She reminded me that I knew how much she liked pools and wouldn't forgive me until the next day (not that I necessarily deserved it). One of our friends told her that I have a pool attention to detail.

Two of my coworkers/friends went to a baseball game and sort of hid it from me. We normally do a trivia thing on Thursdays and they said they weren't able to go, but didn't mention they were hanging out together and didn't invite me.

The thing in common here is me. I'm not enjoyable to be around for my friends, so they aren't inviting me out. I'm not enjoyable to be around with my girlfriend, so she tells me living with me is like working with a middle schooler.

I want so much just to withdraw into myself and save all of these people from dealing with me. I'm garbage. They'd be better off without me."
depression,2019/07/29,"Helping myself and boyfriend cope with depression? My boyfriend (22M) and myself (22F) dated for 3 years, broke up for 2, and are now back together for 2 months currently. When we got back together he said he hasn’t been feeling like himself and after his grandma passed, he has definitely gotten more depressed. He said he feels numb, emotionally unavailable, and doesn’t know how to feel. 
Over the past month he’s become much less engaged with me as in less affectionate and “boyfriend-like”, but always takes time to see me multiple times a week and talk to me through the day on text. I know we love each other very much but this is very draining to our relationship. He plans to contact a counselor this week to go and talk to which I’m very happy about. I’m looking for advice on how to cope with the changes to our relationship, support him, and not make myself unhappy in the process? I haven’t been feeling very happy lately because of how different our relationship has become and how uninterested in simple things like cuddling (for examples) he seems to be. I’ve brought this up to him and he says he just isn’t in the mood to do all of those “lovey-dovey” things and doesn’t want them to come across forced. I’m having trouble not connecting the change to me, even though it’s the depression. I love this boy with my whole heart and want to be there for him through this time."
depression,2019/07/29,"Considering going to an inpatient treatment center, should I? Sorry I post on here so much when I’m depressed. 20F, for about a year my therapist has been urging me to go to an inpatient program. Every single time I’ve said no because my parents - particularly my mom - have convinced me that it’s not what I need and that I’m gonna hate it, so I’ve been scared to go. 

But I’m so tired of being depressed and anxious every day. I’m tired of having an anxiety attack at the thought of going to work or school. I’m tired of dragging myself to work only to go to the restroom every hour to have a place to cry. I’m tired of taking this medication that doesn’t seem to do anything but make me sick. I’m tired of feeling like I have no future and will amount to nothing in life. And I’m tired of constantly wanting to try to kill myself again. 

Should I just go? Therapy once a week (if I’m lucky) doesn’t seem to be doing much for me."
depression,2019/01/07,"[27F] 2018 was the worst year of my life and I'm afraid if 2019 isn't better I'll kill myself \[27cisF\]\[pansexual\] 2018 was the worst year of my life. I quit my job and, with the help of my parents, went to the worst beauty school on the planet in order to get my state esthetics license. All while my 8-year relationship with my then-fiance was falling apart. In March she wanted to open the relationship to have intimate relationships with other trans people. Initially I was hurt because I felt rejected, but I understood the desire to experiment. I said okay on the condition that she would still invest her energy in our relationship. And she didn't.  And in July I moved out. We tried counseling.  And in September I broke up with her. I wasn't a priority to her and it wasn't until 2018 that I finally put all the evidence together. I sacrificed everything for her and she took it all from me.  Everything was always about her. I couldn't take it anymore. I lost my best friend and a third of my life.

Fast forward, today is January 6th and I have this gaping bleeding hole in my soul. I feel unlovable and isolated. I had to move back in with my parents. I keep overdrawing my bank account. The one person I have had any sort of romantic/intimate relationship with is also depressed or just doesn't care about me anymore, so I haven't gotten any of the attention I crave from them since November.  I'm afraid to reach out on dating sites for fear of finding a serial killer or a rapist or being avoided because of how broken I am. I have a few friends but I always feel like an outsider when I'm with them.

I am in so much pain and feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I've been trying to keep my head down and work hard at my new job as an esthetician but when I come home all the pain returns and I wonder what the point of it all is.

The worst part is that I miss my ex so much and can't help but wonder if I did the right thing. If things would be better if I never left. If I was the one who ruined my life and not her."
depression,2019/03/19,"I don’t know what to do anymore I (15F) have been on tons of different ADHD medications since 2nd grade. My parents blamed the medications for my suicidal ideation and extreme depression. We hopped from Concerta to Ridilin to Adderol. I tried to make it clear to my parents that I am not ok, but they never listen and take it as “she’s going through a phase and she’ll get over it”. I started hearing voices about 2 years ago and started self harming about a year and a half ago. My parents noticed my scratches and took it as me trying to get attention. The problem is, that wasn’t the case. I had become so numb to the world around me that the only thing that I could feel was physical pain. It felt good to finally feel something. The voices keep getting worse and I told my therapist this, but she also thinks I’m lying. I have no freaking clue what to do. I know
I’m depressed and have been diagnosed with it and hospitalized, but still nobody will take me seriously. How do I stop the voices? How do I pretend to be happy? How do I hide the scars? I’m so done with hiding things and think tHe would would be better off without having one more annoying voice to listen to."
depression,2019/03/19,"MDD making my life pretty lonely I (38F) am currently struggling with MDD. It’s been going on a year now and I still feel like I am in the same place.  It sucks. I have had situational depression a couple times and have always Spring back but it’s harder this time around. 

I started seeing a new psych APRN and we are trying to adjust my meds.  We added in Lamictal, propranolol (for anxiety), magnesium and tapered Cymbalta. While I was on a relatively low dose (40mg) since tapering I feel very “floaty” and want to cry multiple times a day for no reason and I just feel disinterested in EVERYTHING since tapering.
I am supposed to start Rexulti today.  I’m indifferent about this because of the possible weight gain side effect. My son was on a similar med and gained 30lbs in a super short time-period. 

I hate feeling like this, it’s put a strain on my relationships to the point where I have zero patience, zero desire to do anything and just want to be alone. 

I don’t know if I am unhappy with myself, my situation (I work, go to grad school, have 2 kids- one of whom I have 100% custody of and has emotional problems), my relationship with my SO or am just mentally/emotionally spent. I feel like no one understands what I am going through internally and it is very lonely. 

My therapist feels like when my situation is less “complicated” and I can focus on myself things will look up — but I feel like I am dug in a hole &amp; not sure how to even start getting out.

Has anyone else felt this way? Am I wrong in wanting to be alone to just deal with my stuff?"

depression,2018/11/29,"Depressed Roommate Issues, I don't know what to do. Hey all, this is going to be very long, so there's a tl;dr at the end, but I really pared down the info given below anyway, so do what you wish.

First off, background on me so you can get where I'm coming from: 19F, at a selective college. I've had severe anxiety my whole life (undiagnosed until I was 17), depression for 3 years, eating issues for 5, and trauma issues for 1.5. I'm on medication for anxiety and depression, I've made it a priority to take care of myself so I don't irritate the shit out of others like I did during the worst part of my depression, and I go to therapy as much as possible, along with lowering expectations for school, social life, etc. I've been on the upswing for about five months- during this time period everyone around me has gone to shit. Roommate, friends from high school, family members. When I say everyone I literally mean everyone, so I'm trying to help everyone else around me while not letting myself get bogged down by it because I'm trying to prioritize myself for the first time in my life. I'm also still suffering from fatigue, and emotional and mental burnout, but I'm still a hell of a lot better than I was a few months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my roommate: she's in the same year as me, different major. She was diagnosed with depression a while back, but lost a family member a few months back and things started going downhill. I've been encouraging her to get help for about six months, and she hasn't complied, or if she has, it's barely. Now, I knew she was in a bad mood for the first few weeks of the semester and then I managed to clarify that it was depression. Then, a few months back, she started not finishing all of her meals (I know this because I'm the cook). This has been going on for at least two months. I'm not trying to be harsh, but if she was a full blown anorexic I would have noticed weight loss. She's overweight and there has been no change in how she looks. I caught her once hiding and eating a cookie, I pretended not to notice. It is entirely possible she is in a binge-restrict cycle, but there haven't been physical signs so I can't tell. She has had some bad times with alcohol (going way too overboard) and I've had to take care of her. The past few days she's refused to eat any actual meals. This all probably sounds incredibly selfish, but this is also damaging my own well being and is creating a toxic and negative environment in my room, and I'm really trying not to backslide on the progress I've made, because it's been damn hard and I really do not have to start from square one again, it's a fear of mine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I care about her. We're not super close, but I obviously want her to be healthy. I just can't care for her 24/7. I spend a lot of my time making sure she does things like go to therapy, emails professors, feeds herself, takes care of minor injuries and not let them get infected, and basically I feel like I'm babysitting and I just cannot maintain this for another semester. I want her to feel better but I'm feeling whiny and I wish I didn't have to bear the burden, because she'll only talk to me and no one else, which doesn't seem fair to me. I offer her logical solutions to her problems and she says that I'm right, but doesn't do the smart thing. I listen and offer sympathy and let her rant, but the rants never stop. What's worse to me is that she acknowledges she has a problem but will do jack shit about it herself, and I get that it's not entirely her fault, but it is extremely aggravating for me to deal with. She has barely eaten (That I have seen) the past six days, and I'm worried that she will self harm in a more dangerous and immediate way (yes I know not eating is NOT good for you, but it takes longer for fatal effects to occur). If I had known this was going to be the way my life was, I would not have roomed with her. I'm surprised my own mental health has not disintegrated being around her in all honesty. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I'm being a whiny bitch because I have to babysit my depressed roommate while also having a myriad of mental health problems of my own, and I don't know how to deal with her becoming more and more depressed and me worrying about her self harming. What do I do to maintain my own sanity and prevent her from hurting herself?"
depression,2018/11/29,"Why am I still depressed? Hi there. 15F, no family history of mental illness, no trauma, I have ADD and aspergers if that makes anything any different. 

I was diagnosed with situational depression w/ self harm and suicidal thoughts and prescribed prozac when I was 12 after something as simple as a fallout with friends, starting out with coming out as gay to my best friend / crush and her pushing me away. It was also complicated by struggles with accepting my sexuality and struggling with my religion as well. It is stupid, I know. I won't go into detail but I was in a lot of pain, but I don't like talking about it because I feel like I am trivializing people with real problems. 

Anyways, the situation was forever ago and I'm long over it. But I still have depression symptoms. Not as bad as they used to be, in fact my therapist says I'm improving a lot. But, for the past 2 years I've been stuck in this state of emotional numbness, feeling disconnected from myself, others, and the world; and time doesn't seem to be passing. I also still hate my guts. All for no particular reason.

Is it because I've never let myself healthily recover from the original situational depression? Or because of how hard I ingrained a self-loathing a d negative attitude? I'm not sure. I have no good reason to be depressed if it's not situational. Nothing else is wrong with my life. I just FEEL empty. Is this just a teenager thing? Why am I still depressed if the event that triggered it has been resolved? I just want to find a reason why. 

Any insight would be great. "

depression,2019/03/08,"A word. A sentence. Anything. Please help. I just need a sub to ask for advice on what's going on right now.
Ive been to my doctor alot and even changed doctors. Im honest to therapists.
I googled. I asked family. I asked friends.

Im on 200mg a day anti depressants plus 15mg anti anxieties. 
I take a multivitamin daily. Iron tablet daily because im anemic. I drink water. I exercise.
I do those things to make sure theyre eliminated factors to why Im completely broken. 

Im 29F. 
My husband of one year has left to go 'find himself'. He is a well accomplished good looking man with a strong foothold in his career.
He messages occasionally to say he misses me... he even went as far to ask to meet up this weekend. 
But I know that i wont hear from him for a few weeks again.

My little 8year old has had psychological testing because he wasnt responding well to authoritive figures at school.
He received diagnosis of having elevated emotional receptors. 
Otherwise. All learning fuctions and wellbeing are normal.

He is the most sweetest, intelligent, loving and funny kid I know.
His father (not my husband) has always been more like a 'big brother'. He picks and chooses when to have him and as long as my boy is happy - It is fine. 

Three weeks ago, my little boy didnt listen to his father and got hurt.
Not badly - but still enough for there to be a bruise on his leg.
This led to social services contacting his father and his father obviously contacting me, in a upset manner. 
There is definitely a related reason as to why we havent been together for 7years. 
Still. Managed to make 'co-parenting' work peacefully (i use quotations because i have our child fulltime but letting his dad go around saying he shares equal responsibility even after he has only been to our childs school a handful of times, has never applied with him for sports teams, never been to the dentist with him... you get the picture. Its just easier. My boy loves him and i feel one day he will decide on his own. But i am on high alert) and being kind and friendly every time we saw each other.

My father is an alcoholic. Has been since before I was born. 
The abuse began early as it was carried on from my mother and elder sister except mine ended up being physical. Mother never removed me from situations. 
Almost always had to either forget or receive an apology (from me to him for what he did). One example being: I wouldve been around the same age as my little one. I was asleep in bed. Dad worked lates. 
He came home i guess around midnight - 1, drunk. Came into my room and started yelling. I just remember a whole bunch of shouting. I dont recall any words. 
And then he punched a hole in my wall and walked out. Neither parent came back to my room that night. I got up, turned out the light and went back to bed. I dont remember if i slept. I remember that i cried. I remember no one cared. That night. That day. I even recall my mother telling me numerous times to 'get over it'.

My parents are 68 now. Theyre old, fragile and very different. I love them. They love their grandbabies and treat then soo soo differently.

I study right now, especially from my husband leaving I want to ensure that my kid has the right future with love, kindness and knowing how to respect others.
In saying that, im not a 'man hater'. Im assuming i picked wrong due to  childhood influence. 
I thought my husband loved me. He never abused me. He never yelled at me. He was great with my little one.
He just dosent want us anymore.

My bestfriend tried to commit suicide lastweek.

This is a snippit. Glimpse. Tiny portion of my life Ive written here.
I have to get back to study as I have deadlines and im pushing through to be able to provide independently. 

But i shake everyday. 
I cry everyday.
I cant breathe everyday. 
And i know how to deal with that now.

My littlw boy never sees or feels my hurt.
I make damn sure of that.

I focus on listening to my breathing and wait for my heart to stop racing.

Am i going to be like this forever?
Because I can feel myself weakening and am pushing and pushing and trying so damn hard.
I know I can do it.
I just wish the shaking would stop.
Im alone now.
I know people say im not 'alone'. But i am.
My studies and my child, my cat, my dog. My nephews and my sister and her husband are my saving grace. 
But when i passed my first lot of exams i felt no fucking joy. 
I was angry about not being happy about it.
I worked so hard.
But i wanted to share that with my husband. 

Life goes on.

But no one cares.


I really just want someone to talk to.

Someone whose not being paid by the hour to textbook me.

Thank you for reading. Whoever you are.

depression,2019/08/04,"My (27F) SO (27M) is always a sleep. My SO is a shift worker, working 2 days morning, 2 days afternoon, 2 days night shift. I completely understand that he’s tired from work and it’s hard to get into a normal sleeping pattern but if he’s not at work, he’s asleep. When I speak to him he always complains about not being about to sleep properly (we don’t live together) but I know he puts his laptop on to try to help him fall asleep. He complains about a lot of things, especially work. Should I be worried this is a sign of depression? Or just a sign he hates his job?"
depression,2019/08/04,"“You’re just looking for a reason to be upset.” It’s been a dark couple of months; I just can’t seem to shake the depression that has me in its grip. I’ve been struggling for the past year, even with medication. I keep wondering when the sun will shine on me again, if it ever will. 

Our family (me, 36F, and my husband, 38M, and our 5 children) recently moved to a new house. It was a difficult move with a lot of stress, but things have smoothed out. We left a busy suburban area and moved to a rural area with a beautiful view from each window. Even in my dark times, staring out the window seems to help connect me to the life going on around me. Watching the birds hopping around the yard, and the expanse of lush green grass... it’s not much but it calms me. It reels me back in. I don’t know why. 

I recently came home to a large RV (recreational vehicle) parked at our house. It turns out our friends were in a bind and needed somewhere to park it for awhile. My husband agreed to let them park it at our house, with no real timeline established about when it would be moved. I adore our friends and don’t have a problem with helping them out - except that I was dismayed to find out that the views from the windows inside my house are now obstructed by the RV. No more birds to be seen, no more butterflies or bees buzzing around the yard. No more yard, just a big ugly RV. It’s disheartening, but temporary, I guess. 

I asked my husband if our friends could move the RV to a different spot, somewhere in the yard that didn’t obstruct the view. He thinks I’m making a big deal about nothing. I’m certainly not trying to make anything a big deal. But looking out the window was one of the “safe” things I could rely on while being inside the house. I still yearn to be able to watch nature happening outside while I’m busy inside with chores. Instead of being sensitive or understanding, my husband accused me of using the RV issue as a reason to be upset. As if I WANT to be upset about something. For a guy who has lived with me for almost 20 years, I didn’t think it was possible to understand me any less. 

“I don’t even see you looking out any windows, ever,” he said. “You NEVER look out the windows. You’re just looking for a reason to be upset.”

So now I’m upset. And feeling worse because of this stupid depression that won’t go away. I just wanted to watch the birds outside the windows. I guess it’s a “big deal” to move the RV because there has to be a special truck to move it and who knows what else. I don’t want to be the asshole to bring it up to my friends to move their RV. I will try to hang in there. I completely withdrew myself today, slammed the baby food down and ran crying to my room. Why the hell would any depressed person MAKE UP an ADDITIONAL reason to be upset? Aren’t we already upset about things? The obstruction of my view outside the window is a very real thing to me. It means a lot to me, to be able to see out the window, and I guess I am crazy for being upset about it but what’s new. Now I’m back in a dark place inside myself, just wishing I had the strength to pull myself out of this. Tomorrow I’ll go outside and be with the birds in person. Tomorrow I’ll try harder."
depression,2019/07/30,"Financial Despair First time poster, long time lurker. 29F NC, USA. 

I really need to vent and rant about my depression, so if you are reading, thank you and bear with me. Please.

Things have begun their downward spiral for me, again. I have 2 kids (4y 19ms) and a great husband. No support at all from my family and we've heavily relied on my in-laws for a lot.

I've struggled with depression all my life, but this is the worst it's ever been and I can't believe money is the root of it all. We have 2 financed cars, and are about to lose the one I drive because I can't pay the bill. We're about to have our phones disconnected because the bill can't be paid, and we have tons of medical bills because we can't afford insurance for myself and my kids. I have school loan debt that I wouldn't even dream of affording to pay.

We hardly have food in the house because all of our bills and rent takes up the money my poor husband works his ass off for. His job is a shithole and he gets very stressed because of it and the money he is not making there. 

I can't get a job because my husband was offered a job in VA, but the start date could be in 3 weeks or 3 months. And who knows if we can even move there. We don't have the money to. Even if I could get a job, I still wouldn't be able to afford it because my kids need daycare. Can't afford it!

I am about to lose my mind, making distressing calls to loan-sharks, asking for help, and just accepting defeat.

I haven't been on my medication (Lexapro) since before my youngest was born because my doctor deemed it ""to risky"" during pregnancy, and since haven't been able to afford to get it again. I am lucky to have been able to get birth control thanks to proframs like NURX. 

I have lost my motivation for anything, even taking care of my own kids. We sit around the house playing video games and watching movies because I can't be dammed to get up and play. I hate it and have often cried about it to them. Fortunately, my oldest is still to young to understand. I used to have so many hobbies with them, but I don't even have the desire to find the supplies anymore.

I feel bad because my kids deserve better than their mommy crying all the time and not wanting to even cook sometimes. They are healthy and know we love them, they have plenty of toys and clothes thanks to my inlaws, so they are not neglected... Well not physically anyway.

I just am so lost. I worry about myself. I dont know what to do."
depression,2019/07/30,"A Disheartening Family All I (15F) dream of all day is the sliver--the taste of a new home life. Don't get me wrong, I love my family for they are my blood, but a depressing tone flows between all of us. The downstairs area is where everyone congregates, but if found alone, you could tell my brother, mother, sister, father, whatever, is just barely getting by.

We live under a fair roof. A room for each of us, a yard of grass for the dog, and right now, the bathroom for the kitten we're considering adopting. It's disgusting; Piled plates, unwashed carpets, and the mass collection of blankets and pillows you may fall asleep on late afternoon if you do not feel the motivation to carry yourself to your room, 10 meters away. We have had the same maids all my life, and every week when I come home to a fresh bed and a kitchen counter cleared off, it gives me a sense of momentary happiness.

I live heavy with my severe depression, and so does my mother. When I look at her, I can tell she wants to die. I know she only sees her life as a repetition: To work, to work, and to cook a finishing meal at the end of the day. It's a melancholy sight and somehow I know I'll crawl into her shoes and live a replicate life. 

My father, and my sister, they live with debilitating ADHD that has mutated into many other issues. When I look at them, I can tell they worship their life for every second, but that they suppress the struggles above and underneath. They function as well as my mother and I, limited motivation with a lack of grip on reality. My brother is the odd one out, with the anxiety and mutism factors that meet for a lonely and melancholy social life.

Life is bleak in my family. The cost of existence sees not that we teeter the line of poverty and privilege. It sees not we have lost our dog this February, that my father lost his only long-time stabilized job, that we have run free of money today.

I think about helping my family in anyway with costs, although my talents are one to none. My education is still blooming and I have no money to offer. There is nothing I can offer excluding my presence and promise of my future.

I consider suicide, but if gone through with, the rippling of suicides after mine will leave my family name stunted. My shoulders are heavy and I do not feel like I can carry them anymore."
depression,2019/04/28,"In need for a little hope :))) People who have healed from depression or are doing a lot better, is it normal to feel like you'll never get better? That you could do anything such as going to another country, studying something new, meeting new people... you would never be normal? As if depression will follow you anywhere you go ? And is it true? If not how do you get rid of these thoughts?  


Also, this is secondary but if you have any advice or a comment on a being way to dependent on your SO while being depressed (and not being able to express your needs).

 

A little background : recovering  from anorexia (got ill in July 2017), 21F, also diagnosed anxious and wih tendencies to depression along with anorexia diagnosis."
depression,2019/04/28,"even the constant pointlessness of it all is overwhelming hey there. i’m 21F and i think i’ve been suffering from depression since i was in 4th grade and i hadn’t realised it until now because i tried to forget most of my childhood. my parents fought a lot, LIKE A LOT. they would argue about the least logical things. my dad is so insecure, he would throw tantrums whenever my mom gets a job opportunity so she turned most of them down. they couldn’t pay for my schooling from gradeschool to college, so i relied on my aunt and uncle who had better jobs and were willing to pay my tuition and books so i tried to study hard and i just got my degree on accounting and i’ll be trying to get my license this year. back to my parents, they weren’t awful at parenting though they fed me and gave me home, basically most of my needs were met and i shouldn’t complain BUT living with parents who had an obsessive and unstable relationship takes a toll on u and your emotional well being. My dad is an alcoholic, he drinks almost every night until now. my mom i think is depressed too. There were times that they would throw things at each other, they’d argue so loud that our neighbors would hear everything while i sit in my room listening on their pointless arguments. months later they would make up then fight again. UNTIL NOW. 

i never told any of my friends EVER. i’ve had a fair share amount of friends, i hated arguing so whenever things get kinda rough i would just walk away i didn’t want to be my parents. i hate confrontation. and all these years i am ashamed of admitting how dysfunctional my family is. i know it’s not the worst i know they love me but every day i feel like there’s something wrong with me. i don’t know how to deal with people, i am extremely secretive about my personal life i don’t like the idea that someone i know knows who i am. I can’t maintain good friendships and i don’t have a boyfriend because i always act alone because that’s what i’ve felt all my life. I feel so shitty for blaming my parents for my actions but i have nothing but an emotional roller coaster of a childhood. That’s all i feel, a child stuck in a box not knowing anything but the constant bantering between my parents. it sucks feeling alone all the time it sucks being suspicious and paranoid like my dad, it sucks feeling trapped like my mom. 

I’ve also been suffering from panic attacks recently and last week it was in the middle of the road and i was almost hit by a car. I feel numb, i care about things but it’s always not enough for others. 

this is a mess i’m a mess"
depression,2019/04/28,"My (28F) husband (30M) is suicidal and I am at a loss We live sort of far from family and friends. No one but me knows. His mom thinks he is depressed but she is a little naive about it and just thinks of it like a dramatic teenager would. None of his friends know and have been surprised if they mention his level temperament and I assume they’re joking. He hasn’t talked to me of his own volition in five days he’s sleeping in the basement. When I went downstairs he said in a bunch of different ways that killing himself doesn’t matter and that killing himself without medication is significantly better than taking it and feeling happy if it’s chemically induced. I know I can call 911 or something but he’ll just lie to the intake people, wait out the 72 hours, and then definitely kill himself. I don’t know what to do. I have just felt exhausted and nauseous for so long."
depression,2019/10/09,"I’m concerned about my friend with depression and I don’t know how to help Today my friend (26F) tearfully opened up to me and told me that she’s depressed and she hasn’t told anyone else. She’s found that recently she frequently experiences anxiety, is easily irritated, and has minimal motivation in general. She told me that she hasn’t told her husband (of 6 years) and she’s not sure if she wants to or how to even start the conversation with him, but that they recently had an argument regarding her irritated attitude and it spiraled out of control. She’s been doing some self-loathing because of these feelings she’s had, so I did my best to listen and reassure her that it’s okay to admit her depression, and try to stop the self-loathing. I advised her to talk and be open with her husband so they could be on the same page, especially since he seemed to be taking her behavior personally as if she’s unhappy with him or her unhappiness was his fault. I think her main hindrance is the social stigma of depression. She seemed embarrassed and quite honestly I’m so glad she told at least one person. I don’t think she’s have thoughts of harming herself, she just sounded incredibly sad. 

Overall I felt out of my league in offering advice on her first steps in addressing this. I’m thinking seeking a therapist is a good start? I know she mentioned some of these symptoms to her primary physician and they ran bloodwork to see if they could find a medical reason, but it came back normal. What would you guys advise? Especially considering that she seemed really embarrassed or like she was admitting weakness or failure. Thank you!!"
depression,2019/10/09,"Coping while living with parents Hello! This is my (24F) first time posting in the sub, but I wanted to reach put and see if anyone had any tips or strategies that I could try. 

So a bit of background, I work full time with two year olds and I live with my parents. I'm living with them while I get my loans paid off, which I did, but with the cost of living in my area it's near impossible to live on my own or with others. The only option I can see myself doing is moving an hour and a half away to be where my boyfriend and his family live. I cant do that until the end of the school year.

So, I'm living with my parents the only catch is, it's pretty depressing. I love my mom, but shes very codependent, so it makes it hard to get a handle on my depression. Im on medication, but I'm hoping to taper off it because it's not working well with me. I'm just starting therapy again so that will be a big help.
 
Does anyone have any coping skills they could share?it just gets so lonely in my house, and the feeling is just draining. I'm trying to just try to heal while still living at home, it's hard but it just is what I gotta do for now. What would you guys do in my situation?"
depression,2019/10/09,"Came out to my dad about my depression I (17F) have been struggling with depression for around 3 years now, and although my family have noticed me not feeling great some of the time, they hadn't realised the extent of how bad it had become.  I told my mum about it a couple of months ago, who is an extremely emotionally unavailable parent and did not deal with it well. This made me fall further into my hole and feel like things would never improve and I couldn't talk to anyone.

Tonight my dad witnessed me breaking down in the kitchen. He held me while I cried (more like wailed) and sniffled about how awful I felt and had for so long and just wanted it to be better but I didn't know how. My dad has faced very severe depression in the past and has been on high doses of medication for many years to deal with it. He assured me how much he really understood,  and promised that we were going to get help and sort this out together.

I can't even begin to describe how amazingly well he responded and how much better he made me feel. I never ever thought that this would happen and the fact that I can finally get real help and I have a parent who cares and understands is astonishing and honestly almost put me in shock. I think about halfway through my tears actually turned to tears of joy. I haven't felt this happy in a long time. Maybe it really does get better guys :)

Tl;dr: Had a breakdown and told my dad about my depression. He was extremely understanding and made me feel a lot better and promised to get me help. I feel happier than I have in a long time and I feel like there really may be hope for the future"
depression,2019/10/09,"Long term depression I've been recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I feel like I've been depressed for a super long time. Im 25F but I've been feeling sad and have been battling with my self-concept, self worth and mood for as long as I could remember. I used to think it was a part of my personality and that I could never get out of it. If I had to pinpoint a particular time I can say my lonliness and depression became very prominenent when I was 15ish.   


I'm just curious, is this normal? To feel this bad for this long? There would be peaks here and there, but I can say that majority of my feelings over the past 10 years have been confusing, and depressing."
depression,2019/07/16,"Sleeping all the time - how to talk to the doctor about this. Hello all. I’m 25F, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder with minor depression when I was 17. I’ve been taking 60mg of Prozac for years and years. It used to help a lot.

Now, I don’t feel much different off the Prozac or on; I just get super bad restless leg syndrome off the medication. 

Lately I’ve been feeling bouts of hopelessness. I get really defensive, fight with my boyfriend, then start crying and feeling like I don’t want to live anymore. I use to have panic attacks like this, but they would happen far more quickly and less often; these seem to happen every other week, and they come on slower.

But another thing. I’ve been sleeping a LOT. I slept for 11 plus hours once, and would have slept more. No matter how much I sleep I still feel exhausted. 

If Prozac isn’t working, what should I do? What do I need to tell my doctor? What if there isn’t anything else that can help me? Prozac is supposed to be energizing why isn’t it working anymore?

I feel like if I could I would sleep a day straight. I don’t want sex anymore or find myself wanting to do much of anything. I’m too tired to care about what my boyfriend or anything anyone is saying, only my dog makes me happy these days.

I just don’t know what to do I’ve never experience this. Sorry for rambling."
depression,2019/07/16,"I went to a mental hospital for a week and it saved my life. I came here to share this because even if it inspires just one person to look into getting inpatient care or even just outpatient, that would be amazing. 

I admitted myself in April. I have been struggling with depression since I was 10. I’m 23F btw. I had been taking meds and stopped taking them because I also struggle with anorexia/Bulimia so I wasn’t able to take my meds on an Emory stomach without it just coming back up.. so I was down. Way down than I had ever been in my life. I wanted a hole to just swallow me up and end my existence. 

I talked to my therapist about this and she recommended inpatient care would be the best thing for me, at the time.

I was nervous about going to the mental hospital and getting my mental health assessment done, but I had the nicest woman with me and she made everything so comfortable and made me feel like I wasn’t crazy, because I just felt so weird that I was actually in a hospital like this. 

The first night was the hardest. But everyday got better and they regulated my meds and group therapy was tremendously helpful. I met very interesting, different, and intelligent people who were going through the same thing. 

The day I got out I felt like a new person hopeful for the future for the first time in a very long time. I am now pursuing my goals and I am taking it day by day, step by step. My favorite advice was “fake it til you make it”. :)

Really what I want you to get from this post is that there is hope for all of us. We can do this. We all deserve to be happy and to enjoy life. 

Step by step. ♥️"
depression,2019/07/16,"Helped me more than meds 23F I did an experiment where I used thc/cbd pens once a day for 2 weeks and I felt better than I've felt in years and it definitely helped with my depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia issues more than any therapy or meds has ever helped me (been diagnosed for 15 years) BUT now I live somewhere were these things are illegal and I have too much anxiety to attempt to get these things. I have tried various cbd products that are legally extracted from hemp sold online but it doesn't work nearly as well as when its combined with thc. What do I do? Is there anything similar thats helped you?"
depression,2019/07/16,"I made a Hip Hop playlist called ""Lamenting &amp; Sad Hip Hop"". It's helped me through tough times, so maybe it can help you too. [The Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/9jif2jecb7qpfw25qyz20c9ed/playlist/2Ka8i0P9BGogjccGz0FiE5?si=-p9yt61-QLqQhbqS2uED1w)

Hip Hop has helped me get through a lot of rough patches in my life. I've been listening to it for 10+ years, so I hope this playlist can really help anyone dealing with depression or anxiety like I am."
depression,2019/04/29,"Never experienced this myself I (23F) consider myself a happy, laidback person. There are a lot of people around me with depression/mental illness. My long term boyfriend (24M), my younger sister, my younger brother, my older sister, my stepdad. So I’ve seen what it can do and how differently it can affect people, so I thought when it happened to me I would notice right away!

Well I didn’t. Seemingly out of nowhere, I feel like I was just weighed down so badly. I didn’t even really notice until my bf pointed out to me how I hadn’t done homework, laundry, or dishes in over a month. (I know that makes him sound bad, but typically I do majority housework because I have more free time. He picked up the slack while I was in this state). Anyways, I honestly felt like I was half of me...just a shell pretty much. I had no appetite, no desire to pull myself off the couch and do something, and I wasn’t really sad so much as I just wasn’t there. But there were moments of overwhelming sadness where all I wanted to do was cry. 

I guess I’m just hoping to get any and all info/advice from anyone?

Part of the reason I think that this is going on is that I’ve had some health problems recently, so I have bills piling up and since I have class 3 days a week I’m only working 2 twelve hour shifts a week and whatever I can get on the weekends, but that = no money. I also withdrew mentally from school and classes are harder and harder to make myself go to, so being behind is making things worse. 

Some of my health issues include a really fast heart rate that we’re trying to figure out...they put me on beta blockers to try and lower it + anxiety levels. They also put me on a vitamin d supplement since my levels were extremely low. I’m also seeing a neurologist for frequent headaches. He has me on a medicine that’s an antidepressant but is also used to treat headaches. 

Before I was put on the beta blocker, I was on cymbalta for anxiety (I didn’t think cymbalta was used to treat anxiety but I’m not a dr). That stuff really made everything worse for me. I honestly felt like I was drowning and there was no way out. That was the worst of it. The beta blocker has lifted me out of that funk but now after using the blocker for a couple of months, I feel like I’m slipping back into that state. I’m randomly so overwhelmed that I feel like all I can do is curl up in a ball and cry myself to sleep. But other times I’m in a really, really good mood! I will feel good about myself and my body and I’ll legit feel like “I can tackle school and my bills!! I will make it out of this no problem!” That’s how the old me would feel majority of the time. And I love feeling that way. But it lasts maybe for a couple hours and then I go back to normal or back to feeling a bit down. 

I’m exhausted going back and forth between these emotions. I don’t know what to do, I’m scared to keep putting all of these medications in me because I’m wondering if they’re the problem (maybe they’re interacting badly or my body doesn’t like them) I just want to feel like me again. I want to have fun and not be surrounded by this dark cloud. I want to be the person who helps lift people out of their funk again instead of being the person who is in it. I’m sorry if I offend anyone by anything I said I just am new to feeling things like this so it’s all very different to me. 

Please, feel free to tell me your stories or anything you found that helps/helped you.

TLDR: I’m looking for advice on how to deal with depression/feel like myself again."
depression,2019/04/29,"Does anyone else get extra depressed when it’s around the time of their birthday/special holidays?? Long story short, I [24F] had a child at 16 (single mother) I was also self destructive for a veryyyyy long time and was just diagnosed with cptsd in the middle of last year. I feel like I have broken the chain and my daughter is the only one in my family who shows me a lot of love and she is just really different. I know it is because of me and the way I’ve raised her.. anyway, when it comes around to my birthday and what not, I can’t help but feel extra empty around this period? I don’t know why, and people keep telling me to look at the positives and to look at how far I have become, but it’s just really hard. I feel like I’m never enough and ever since I’ve come out of the mental health facility recently, I’ve also literally lost all my friends, which I am a bit sad about. I don’t know, i thought I would of achieved so much more by the time I’ve turned 25 but I feel like as I get older, It’s become harder to cope? I guess the positive is that I now have insight into my actions and I am actively seeking therapy and doing all of that, but I thought that this “emptiness” would go away as I get older, but it hasn’t. Just wanted to know if it was just me or if you guys do also feel more lonely/depressed around their birthday/special holidays?"
depression,2019/04/29,"Please help I (19M) have been struggling with depression sence the junior year of high school. I stopped taking my meds due to the fact that they make me sick and jittery. My girlfriend of 5 years (19F) recently came out as polyamorous, and said she was already texting another guy. She told me it would never work and that absolutely crushed me. For the first time in over a year my suicidal thoughts re-emerged. I'm scared and dont know if I can make it. How did you guys get through it?"
depression,2019/04/29,"Dealing with self-hatred. I (27F) honestly feel really lost and even writing this makes me feel weak and pathetic. I struggle greatly with self-hatred and I just don’t know how to stop. I’m in therapy and I’m on medication but for whatever reason I just have such a difficult time believing in myself again. 

My childhood was a mess in certain ways ie mother is a bipolar pill addict who is now crippled due to a stroke. She chose to quit physical therapy (even though she was progressing and walking with a walker) and now her right side has atrophied. My dad basically works in a nursing home now taking care of her (she wears diapers and soils herself instead of letting her caretaker take her to the bathroom) but like with her addiction he says nothing and let’s her do whatever. So he comes home at the end of the day and cleans her up and waits on her hand and foot. She’s obese now. 

In college, I was raped and then drugged and almost raped again. 

I’ve been working through these issues and I’ve gotten far to some degree. But my biggest struggle is not fucking hating myself. My depression reminds me of my mom and I feel like I’m turning into her, which is one of my biggest fears. Especially with my poor eating and lacking exercise habits. 

I want to be a filmmaker. I’ve been writing screenplays since high school and I used to write them all the time. But ever since I graduated college in 2016, I have no motivation. I made a short film, more or less about my rape, and it wasn’t as good as I wanted to be. And it’s my fault. I was in a horrible headspace, unprepared, and inexperienced. 

It’s been really hard for me to come back from that because it got rejected by so many festivals. I’ve only worked hard on one screenplay since then and I’m still not done. (Made that film in 2017 by the way) 

I’ve wasted so much time and even knowing that I continue to waste it. I’m not strong headed anymore. I don’t believe I’m capable of success. I look at other aspiring artists around me and compare myself so much that it makes it worse. 

I completely fucking hate myself and it’s ruining my life. I don’t know how to convince myself I’m not a waste of space."
depression,2019/08/11,"Depressed Girlfriend Advice Needed My girlfriend(30F)and I(29M)have been dating for 2 years. She battles depression and anxiety. Recently we got in an argument about how come I haven’t proposed yet. She wanting to be married and have children right this instance while she’s working and in school. I want to marry her but I don’t think we are financially ready and that make her upset when I try and breakdown the financials. A child is a lot of responsibility and I don’t want to bring something into this world if I can’t provide the baby with everything I had growing up. She is so upset with me right now she has mentioned that she was to go out of town to be by herself for a night.

I don’t know how I feel about this. I want her to be happy, but I’m also worried on why she needs to leave me and be alone. A part of me is like if she goes and does this our relationship is done. I’m not sure what to feel and it upsets me. Any advice?"
depression,2019/08/11,"Falling into a very sudden depression I'm 25F. I used to suffer pretty severely from high functioning anxiety and depression until i went to a 6 month program to help myself live and accept it. That was back in 2015 and life has had its minor ups and downs but so far 2019 has been great. 

Until last month. In the span of 2 weeks my uncle went to prison for child pornography, my other uncle passed away, and i was diagnosed with crohns disease. 

Ive had this past week off from graduate school so i feel like its really sat and marinated and i constantly feel on the verge of tears. I avoid going out because I think something will trigger a panic attack or an emotional breakdown. At the same time, i feel so cooped up in my apartment all alone doing puzzles all day with intermittent crying spells. 

I dont have many friends, they all went home for break and my school is pretty far from where i live anyways. My question is: what has helped you guys get out of ruts like this? I know if i keep doing what im doing it will continue to get worse and worse, but I dont feel like I have the mental or physical capacity to do anything else. 

I know somewhere in my head is a seedling of 'things will get better' but its so hard to believe right now."
depression,2019/07/17,"I felt like I had been living a double life for a while...but now my feelings of hopelessness are even creeping in at work. I had always described myself as having 'depressive tendencies' but I have never been formally diagnosed with depression. At age 19 (I am 26F), I had some concerns about how terribly 'low' I felt, seemingly around 2 weeks before my period, so I was prescribed Yaz, a birth control pill meant specifically for this. It seemed to help at first.

But time has gone on, and after the acute-ness of a new life event dims down (In this time I have graduated with a nursing degree, moved permanently across the world, gotten married, husband went through a psychotic break, I got a new job), these super 'low' feelings always seem to creep back up. It just feels like, life is pretty hopeless. That I am exhausted and can't muster the strength to do anything or see anyone. My weight has fluctuated. That I don't believe anyone when they try to give me a compliment. At it's absolute worst, it feels as though I wouldn't mind if I were to fall asleep and not wake up, though I can tell myself this is not a rational way to think. In any case, all these feelings, I could manage to hide at home.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting about 6 months ago, disagreements or confrontations at work, led to me to cry in front of my coworkers on a few occasions. I started taking vitamins in the hopes that it could combat my poor mood. But then today I had yet another one of these crying episodes.

depression,2019/07/17,"Having a really shitty week I’ve (21F) struggled with depression and anxiety on and off since I was like 13, and I’m pretty good at kicking it’s ass and telling it to leave me alone if I don’t say so myself. However, the past couple of weeks have been pretty tough. I work in retail and an opportunity came up for a managerial position and I applied for this around Feb, I got an interview and then a second interview and then they told me I’d have to do some more training and a project thing before I actually get it. My manager was furious as he was confident I’d get this job and he’d never heard of anyone else in the company being set a ‘project’. This all happened about a fortnight after my grandpa passed away, so at first I thought great something I can throw myself into to take my mind off of things. 2 months later here I am and I am absolutely sick. I am good at my fucking job, sometimes it’s stressful and challenging but still I’m good at what I do. I was crap at school so this project I have been set has majorly stressed me out, I’m bad at writing things down and explaining. I just feel like I’m not good enough and it has taken over all of my free time and I just don’t feel like it’s worth it. I can’t deal with the anxiety it’s giving me. I just want to be able to come home from work and switch off and I feel this has made that impossible. I used to enjoy work but now I resent it with every inch of my body. And now I’m starting to feel like because I’ve been so focused on work I haven’t processed my grandpas death properly and I’m just a bit of a mess to be honest. I don’t know whether I’m coming or going, I feel like I’m going to fail. I need this job. I need the money, I wanna move out and have a comfortable life without feeling like I need a partner to do so. I have also not long came out of a toxic and abusive relationship and I just want to feel like I can do this whole life thing on my own, not being dependent on anyone because I promised myself I’d never ever rely on anyone but myself, not even my parents because as amazing as they are they aren’t perfect and they can and will let me down sometimes so it’s easier to just not rely on them to save an argument. I just feel like depression has its claws in my back and I’m trying to fight it but I’m struggling this week and I don’t want to leave my bed.

depression,2019/07/17,"When will I (23F) move on from suicide attempt/hospitalisation? TW: suicide, overdose, hospital

I overdosed on my medication about 3 weeks ago. I knew I didnt want to die but at the time I was desperate to escape. I was hospitalized for 4 days and suffered a seizure. 

I'm on new medication and have been suffering commo side effects, unlike my old medication. It has been hard to not think about what transpired those 4 days, I'm constantly trying to remember what happened as my memory of the entire thing has blanks in them. I hallucinated a lot, thought my mom was crying tears of fruit flies and when I tried to give her a napkin she said, ""I'm not crying."" 

It wasn't worth it. I regret it very, very very much. It was my very loud cry for help and am seeking a psychologists help now. When  will it get easier to  not think about the pain I caused to all the people who loved me? 

Please seek help. I cant stress this enough. I saught help a little late, but now I know I cant handle my depression and anxiety alone.

depression,2019/08/19,"My depression makes me an asshole I (21F) have been pretty good for a long time, but before I went home for summer I went through some shit where a guy basically played hard with my feelings. During summer break I had very low self-esteem - although multiple boys showed their interest in me I just felt like trash. 

It got better towards the end of the holiday, but now that I'm back everything is quite bad. This guy and the girl he went behind my back with lives at the same place as I do, and they seem to have some sort of thing going on. She hasn't really done anything towards me, as he kind of went behind her back as well.

I know it's wrong but I can't help but feel not good enough and pathetic, and I cling to the hopes that I'm prettier than her, better liked etc.. And I tend to trash talk her quite a bit to my friends, and I know it's wrong and it just makes me a bad person, but I feel so at loss. I hurt so much and I just feel like the people around me think I'm a bitch when I'm like this.

I can't afford therapy at the moment, and I don't want to talk to my friends about this anymore because I feel like they're beginning to get tired of it. I just want to be the person I used to be, the one I really am, because this is not it.

depression,2019/06/01,"Need advice on how to deal with my(29F) parents(60M,60F) grief/depression from brothers(30M) recent suicide   

Hey guys, I’m new to reddit but I hope to get some advice on how to deal with some rocky family dynamics. If this isn’t the right subreddit for this please point me in the right direction. 

Two years ago my brother died of suicide after 12 years of struggling with his bipolar and addictions (cocaine, alcohol, meth, pain killers, probably more). Him and I had a very poor relationship the 3 years before he died, with me trying my best to cut him and his drama out of my life. My parents had always been very enabling of his addictions and very poor life choices, so when I decided to cut him out of my life, they did not see it my way. In fact the last time he relapsed, my parents started treating me poorly and chose him over me for family events (as I was the one who was being unreasonable). When he passed away I obviously was devastated, I always held onto hope that he would get back on his meds and stop self medicating with illegal drugs. My parents (and extended family) were crushed by his death, my parents always hid his addictions and mental illness from family and friends so I was left being the one explaining to family how bad things were and how he was a bipolar addict. Yes we tried numerous times to get him help, 100k worth of private rehab later he just became better at manipulating people.

I held it together as best I could since my parents were destroyed by his passing. It took me about a year to get back into my life routine and accept he was gone. Part of why it took a year is because my parents guilted me into doing so many things with them during that year. I live 4 hours away from them, but it was always expected I’d drive up for anything remotely family related. This really impacted my job/life. So after a year, I decided no more, and started telling them no. Now it’s been 2 years since his passing, but whenever I see my parents its like it only happened a month ago. I started to dread seeing them because they try to pull me down into their vortex of grief and sadness. It would take me a few days after seeing them to get back to my usual happiness level and shake off their depression. I’m not sure if seeing me just reminds them that he’s gone? Or maybe they’re always this way now? Either way I can’t continue like this. I love my parents and want to see them but it’s too much. How can I navigate this situation? Should I be upfront and just tell them that their negative attitude every time I see them affects me strongly and that’s why I’m avoiding them? Or should I continue to just ignore it and blame being busy with work for why I only see them every few months now? 

TL,DR: Parents are devastated by my brothers death, their grief is still so strong 2 years later it’s negatively impacting my life/mental health every time I see them. Should I point out that they’re projecting their grief onto me and that’s why I’m avoiding them now? Or just ignore it and hope they don’t get more upset that I’m absent from family things?"
depression,2019/06/01,"I feel like my family is the source of my depression. Long story for those who care to read... thoughts? I’ve always dealt with my emotions enough to know when I need to pick myself up and try again... lately that hasn’t been the case. by lately I mean a year. 
Backstory:
I recently found out that my (23F) mom took out a credit card in my name years ago. She made herself an authorized user and racked up about $5,000 in debt however she hasn’t made the payments in about 2 years. My credit score is completely screwed as a result. When I was 15 my parents split due to the fact that my mom did this same thing to my dad over the course of their 21 year marriage so to find that she did this to me after that is ridiculous. I live with her and I confronted her about the situation in which her response was that she did nothing wrong and I should get over it. I wanted to fix this so my stupid self worked strenuous amount of hours to fix the mess. But how can I get over it? How? How could I get over it? I’m supposed to be transferring to university next year and everyday I cry because I just don’t know how I’m going to do it. I can’t get a loan because of the credit and I want to leave so bad but I can’t cause of the credit. What did I do to deserve this? I haven’t told my dad because I fear he’ll want to take legal action and I still do care about her wellbeing, but at the same time she doesn’t seem to care about mine. My dad has been nagging me because I need to be more “self sufficient” and he just really thinks I’m some sort of idiot that doesn’t have her shit together because he isn’t aware of what happened. It pains me everyday to think that I’m protecting my mom when every time I see her I just get so pissed. It pains me to know my hard work went toward someone who didn’t have any consideration for me. Some days I don’t leave my bed because I’m just so tired and so sad. I’m so tired of living in a world where I am just here and my problems are a result of other people’s actions. I have an amazing boyfriend who always is so positive and proactive, but unfortunately my depression is so bad that I just cannot see the brighter side to things. Some days I even just wish something bad would happen to me to just make things stop. Worst of all... my mom to this day will not own up to her actions and constantly screams at me for basically existing. I feel like the longer I stay in the environment I see no progress but only me spiraling out of control. Thank you for those who read."

depression,2019/05/29,"How to be strong when I feel weak I (23F) have been going through a lot these last few months. Life has been overwhelming. Medical stuff, losing a community and friends that I cared deeply for, unemployed and difficulty finding a job, eviction notice threats. It feels like circumstance has been working to kick me down every step of the way. Despite everything, I've tried to pick myself up. Work on myself. And it was a slow climb but I'd slowly started to feel better.

Last night felt like it broke me. My girlfriend (ex? I don't even know) also suffers from depression. She'd been busy lately and stressed. I knew she was probably depressed too, but she'd been really distant so I assumed she wanted some alone time. And I hate that I never realized how awful things were for her. We talked last night. She confessed to me she was far more depressed than she'd let on and also feeling suicidal. Over the course of the conversation she told me she didn't feel stable enough for a relationship.

At the time, my response was immediate. ""I understand, I love you and if you feel like that's the best thing for you I get it."" And I still feel like that. I do love her and just want to be in her life and there for her whether it's as lovers or friends. But right now I just feel shitty. I feel like I failed her. I wasn't there for her when she was suffering and needed someone. I didn't see it when I should have. I feel like I don't deserve her in my life at all. I hate that the breakup feels like a karmic punishment for being a trash girlfriend to her. And it's making it really hard to try to be there for her now. I shouldn't be making it about me, and keep trying to put the thoughts out of my head, but they're getting overwhelming.

And the worst part is I can't even talk to her about how I'm feeling. She was already feeling guilty and the last thing I want is to make her feel that way. And she has no reason to feel guilty in the first place. My happiness is not her responsability. She doesn't owe me anything. I want to be strong. I want to be someone she can confide in. Someone who can help in just a small, simple way. But I feel weak and alone and scared and I don't know if I can be the person she needs right now. And that's just feeding the cycle of self-loathing and regret."
depression,2019/05/29,"Depressed, on verge of breakup, small support structure My girlfriend (26F) of three years and I (28F) are in a bad place right now, on the verge of a break/break-up after she admitted to having feelings for someone else and not knowing what she wanted for our future. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety since around October when one of my students passed away and my grandma started showing signs of dementia (facing mortality blows). My entire life and support structure is rooted in her - I live with her and her parents, and the vast majority of our friends were her friends first. My family lives 2,000 miles away, and I have maybe two good friends out here. Luckily, those friends have been great and gave me a place to crash last night and clear my head. 

I've done all the right things - exercised more, forced myself to eat enough even when I have no appetite, seen therapists,  forced myself to go out and be social, called friends back home, but I just cannot sleep through the night, even with nighttime medicine. I keep checking my phone and wanting to talk to her even when I know we need space to figure out whether the relationship is worth salvaging or not. Even though the fundamental issues in the relationship are not ""my fault,"" I can't help but feeling like if I had seen the red flags earlier when I was only mildly depressed, we wouldn't be in the mess. My heart isn't in anything right now - I can barely make myself go to work and pull through the day. I just gave my students some BS project because I'm struggling so hard to put on a happy face. I don't know how people get over feeling this way. I don't even want to be in my own skin anymore. How do you fight through the worst days when the light at the end of the tunnel seems so far away? Starting a new life without her feels like an insurmountable task, but it's one I have to prepare myself for if things don't work out."
depression,2019/05/29,"Just feel so low. I had to leave my career in biochemistry and nutrition research, my PhD and lecturing job to become the carer for my mum and dad after my dad had a mini stroke (he is alcoholic because my mum is emotionally abusive) and mum very suddenly and steeply declines in to Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson’s. Social services wanted my dad (80y) to be mums carer. That just won’t work or be safe as he is nearly blind and alcoholic and has balance problems from his mini stroke. Mum needs to people to love about and often doesn’t make it to the toilet on time. Dad thought he was clearing up we’ll but wasn’t. Social services would only provide Mum towel baths from then on, no stair lift or downstairs wet room  conversion, just the understairs toilet sink. Mum and dad are very depressed and mum blames us for her illness and is very narcissistic (always has been). I had just got out of an emotionally abusive step marriage and had had 3 years living with my step son before this happened. But it’s all gone now. I’m trapped back in my childhood home with mum toxic parents who I love but who are very emotionally manipulative and all consuming. They have a dog and I have two. So I was caring for 2 adults, 3 dogs and my step son who tried to take his own life last year just after we moved back in with my mum and dad. I found his suicide text in the morning when I woke and spent and hour looking for what I thought was a body. He was still alive covered in mud on a river bank near by. He had taken a massive massive overdose. All of my savings went in to my education. I 42F and feel now I will never have my own life. It’s always full of misery and abuse. I’ve worked so hard and overcame an eating disorder (which stopped me at my first attempt to do my PhD). The marriage breakdown stopped my second attempt, when my emotionally and sexually abusive husband became physically abusive and my stepson (his son) grabbed me and said we should leave. I took him the dogs and fled. Every time I am nearly back on my feet I get swiped down. I saved £15000 working full time to put myself through uni doing 2 masters degrees to best place me in my field to do my PhD. I was the module lead for two taught modules at uni and a research technician as my PhD began. Then dad called and said “mum is sick and I’m not coping”. Now I breakdown at everything. I walked past some sheep in a lorry near where I know there is a abattoir and I just broke down and couldn’t cope with seeing them scared and huddled together as I walked my dogs, trying not to step on the snails that came out in the rain. Life is so bloody cruel. I hate it. Some dick just had a go at me on the streetlights sub Reddit just for posting a video which apparently has been posted too many times. But just having a stranger have a go really upsets me in an out of proportion way. I’m so tired and so worn thin. Sorry for rambling. Had to tell someone. My brother just walked away from the whole problem and I feel so let down. And alone. Take care out there. Love to you all. X"

depression,2019/08/20,"Boyfriend’s depression is ruining our relationship. Please help. Let me start off by saying that I love this man, and I would do anything to make him happy. I (20F) have diagnosed CPTSD and he (20F) has diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder. He’s still in the early stages of medication and treatment, as he only received his diagnosis a few months ago, and I’ve been working with mine since I was 13. 

When he’s well, he his the kindest, most thoughtful man I could ask for. He’s sensitive, compassionate to my anxiety and supports me through it, plans spontaneous dates — we have fun together no matter what we’re doing.

But right now, he’s not doing well. He’s very, very emotionally withdrawn. His energy levels are low, and he wants to sleep all day. He feels like a failure in school because he’s not meeting his own standards for himself (even though he’s doing very well by his professors standards). 

I’m trying my hardest to build him up, give him space, come to doctors appointments if he wants me there, encourage him in his career, show up to his concerts (he’s a musician), plan romantic evenings for the two of us, give him affirmation. 

I know this sounds so selfish, but I’m struggling with not getting my emotional needs met, and it’s weighing on me- because right now, he just can’t meet them, and I can’t hold that against him. He needs so much down time in between seeing people (including me. We don’t live together), that it sometimes feels like I’m a burden on him, even though he would never say that. 

How do I help him? How do I keep myself healthy so that it doesn’t affect me so badly? I’m sorry this is such a selfish question. I’m just so discouraged, and need to know if I’m being ridiculous for still staying around and fighting for him."
depression,2019/08/20,"I don't know what's wrong in my head. I'm probably in the wrong sub and you're all probably sick of seeing these type of posts so apologies in advance. 


I (25F) don't know if I'm anxious or depressed or whatever combination of the two. For various reasons, I can't see a doctor yet to be formally diagnosed so the internet is my next best option. 

I'm not even sure where or how to start. 

For the last few days, off and on, I've just been... Down. Tired, angry, head hurts, I've been grinding my teeth again. I lash out at my parents and it just feels like I'm hanging on by a thread. And I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. Or just sleep.

I should mention that this doesn't happen all the time. I have good moments. I go out with friends, I'll feel better for a day or two, but then one day I'll wake up and I'm back in that pit. 

I know I have anxiety, but I've never checked to see if I have depression. While I was in the US (last two years, grad school), I did see a counsellor and she suggested that I have moderate anxiety and mild depression. 

Right now everything is exacerbated and amplified because I had to leave grad school and move home and at the moment I'm jobless and at home. Every time I even think about getting a job, I feel my mind seize up and it's like I can't speak or breathe. At my worst, I just want to end things. The only things stopping me are my family and my religion. No, I can't tell my family, but I won't kill myself because they've been through and are going through enough without me adding to it and I don't have any religious person to talk to either. 

It won't be helpful, but I need a neutral third party to tell me if I'm imagining all this or if it's real. Because it's not always like this. I have good days, I go out with friends, I hang out with my cousins, I laugh, I smile. 

I just need help."

My doctor stopped my meds gradually last year and I felt fine for a month or two but after that, I went right back to square one, which made me feel worse because I had experienced what life was like when I'm not depressed. I told him about this and I'm on my meds again, he keeps telling me things will get better and it'll be alright but 
 I'm starting to feel I will never get better, that I would have to depend on meds my whole life just to feel normal. I'm starting to feel like this whole thing is just pointless which terrifies me and idk what to do. 
My doctor's appointment is later this week and I'm not sure if I should go."
depression,2019/07/22,"Realizing I'm depressed made me even more depressed I(21F) browsed though this subs top posts a few days ago and what is described in these posts is exactly how I've felt over the past year or maybe even longer.

I always told myself i wasn't depressed and just seeking attention or ""Other people have it worse than you"" etc.

It's hard to realize as i still go to work and do my thing. Apparently thats called functional depression (?). And I'm very turbulent. I've always been. One week im feeling great and then out of no where im depressed for a week and want to die.

So there's that. I'm depressed. What do i do now?"
depression,2019/06/27,"I haven’t gone to work in a week and a half. (24F) I’ve always suffered with major depressive disorder. But this year has been absolute HELL! I have had one massive thing happen after another. My depression has been so bad that it’s makes me physically ill, resulting in my not going to work. I actually love the job I currently have, but it’s door to door sells, and I also have a broken foot. So not only is it mentally taxing, it’s physically taxing too. I just took a shower for the first time in days, and had to sit down halfway through cause I was just so exhausted. And ended up having a whole complete breakdown. I just want my partner to hold me, but their working for another 3 hours, and then going out with friends after. I don’t want them to have to cancel hanging out with their friends, especially since I already feel like I’m such a fucking burden on everyone. So I don’t even want to tell them how bad I currently am. I just feel so lost, stupid, and hopeless."
depression,2019/06/27,"I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to be alive. I’m 14F and I’ve had depression and anxiety for a couple years, but lately it’s gotten so much worse. I’m so angry all the time, I see red, I want to scream, I just get so unreasonably angry that nothing seems worth it. But the anger is accompanied by such sorrow and self hatred that I don’t see the point in existing anymore. My dream for so long was to be on broadway or just be in acting but I’m in the school production this year and I want to drop out so badly because I have no passion. I have a girlfriend who I adore greatly but I don’t have the energy to talk to her or to be around her, I want to break up with her but when I think of a reason my mind is blank. I don’t like anyone else and I’m happy in our relationship but I guess deep down I don’t think I deserve her. I’ve pushed my family away due to my anger and though they still try to be there for me I know it’s hard. I feel like such a burden to everyone I love that I just, don’t want to be alive. 

I’m not suicidal, I know that it’d hurt my family too much if I killed myself, but they barely see me anymore. I sleep all the time and not because i’m tired, I could get 10 hours of sleep during the night and still take 3 3 hour naps during the day, and then still pass out for the night at 10. When I’m asleep it’s like I don’t exist anymore, no worries about if my homework’s done, if the kitchens clean, if my room isn’t messy, i’m finally at peace with my mind. but when i’m awake, the anxieties come back, the voices come back, the feeling of nothingness comes back. I’ve been suicidal, and i’m not suicidal now because i know i couldn’t do it. I just wanna escape for a couple weeks, just to reset. maybe chuck my phone off a bridge and go on holiday to the snow when i don’t have to worry if i look fat because i’m wearing so many layers. but even then i know it’d be too hard. what should i do? does anyone else feel like this? and i know this is long and poorly written, i’m on mobile and wrote the first half after a night of no sleep and the second after 2."
depression,2019/06/27,"I was doing so well until the love of my life turned abusive I’m just so upset right now. I don’t think I’m in a major depressive episode but I’ve been acting like it for sure. 

I’m 25F. I have lived with depression on/off (mostly on) for about a decade now and have had GAD as long as I can remember. 

I had made some huge improvements at 20 by starting SSRIs, finishing my high school, and starting university. I felt like I was starting to be a human for once. 

I met him a few years ago as coworkers. I was so infatuated. We wrote letters to each other. He wrote poetry. It was amazing. I hadn’t felt true love before. It sounds corny I guess, but it’s true. 

The first half of our relationship made me believe in love. 

I don’t know if he was hiding his true nature or if something became twisted, but his controlling and jealous nature became worse and eventually he became emotionally, then verbally, then physically abusive. 

I knew I couldn’t survive like that so after 9 months of abuse I left him. But now I can’t seem to get over it (it’s been since early May). I vaguely remember the abuses but what I strongly remember is the false feeling of hope I felt for once in my life that something (or someone) would end up good. 

I can’t get over the guilt, the memories of happiness, the grief for what we were/could have been. 

We moved together to a new province and I feel very alone. I feel like most people expect me to have stopped talking about him now but he’s always on my mind. Worse, he doesn’t seem to be in as rough of a position as me. 

It’s not fucking fair."
depression,2019/04/07,"Was i that ugly in high school?(21F) [what I looked like in high school ](https://imgur.com/a/vZXqTpw)



Can I talk to you about something? Am I ugly I in high school guys would say they would sleep with but not want to be seen with me? They would say I'm good enough to fuck but not date. that they wanted me for sex and nothing more. They called me a pig and said I looked 40

They would call me a gross whore and say I smell every day. They said I had a big nose and wrinkles. I just so ugly I'm scared I'm scared to date again that guys would treat me this way. 

I had an older guy date me in high school, but he told me not to say to people I talk to him. He would never want to hang out with me just sex. He would call me annoying and weird. He would imply I'm not attractive enough to date.

I'm so anxious now that everyone is going to treat me this way. I haven't dated since high school I feel like ugly trash. I barely leave the house because of anxiety 

Was I that ugly in high school? What could I change? Will, I will always be treated this way?"
depression,2019/04/07,"My depression got worse since university I've (18F) always been an emotionally complicated child, but my unhappiness worsened  drastically when my mother passed away from cancer around 2 years ago. After that, I lost interest in almost everything and anything. I used to draw, create, bake, write, cook, read, and feel so happy doing all these hobbies, but I can barely pick up a pen now and all I do to pass the time is lie in bed and watch pointless YouTube videos. 

Losing passion has made my university application so much harder. I had been a high achieving student before, but at the end of the year my high school results were nowhere near my expectations throughout school. I did get into a bachelor's though, but then I had no idea what to choose as a major or what I wanted to do in life. 

It doesnt help that my father has very high expectations for me and wants me to become a doctor/lawyer. Throughout the application process he was silent while I needed guidance, but once I randomly chose my subjects and finalised enrollment he ranted and screamed at me for being a disappointment, lazy, for choosing something that wouldn't land me a job. 

I live by myself now for university, and although I have friends from high school, I find it hard to connect with them and it feels as if I am wearing a mask when I'm communicating with them. I feel guilty for not being sincere with them but I know that I shouldnt burden them with my real self. I also have a hard time making friends in my classes, so when classes end I go home and go to sleep. 

I sleep for 10+ hours every night, I'll have 2-4 hour after noon naps as well. On weekends I spend most of the day sleeping or lying in bed watching videos. 

I'm severely depressed because I feel as if I have no direction in life. The course I've chosen doesn't interest me at all, and I'm not doing very well in it. The only thing that probably gives me joy is my long distance boyfriend, but everyone disapproves of the long distance, I barely get to talk to him because he works during the day, and high school relationships tend to end in the first term of uni. I'm scared of losing him. 

I feel so guilty for feeling the way I do. My life isn't particularly difficult, and people are often in much harder positions that I am. I feel like I'm not worthy of being helped because I feel like I'm faking it, but at the same time I desperately don't want to feel like this. 

TLDR; sleep too much and depression due to uncertainty in life and not having any passion in university subjects "
depression,2019/04/07,"Not sure what to do. I have no idea why I’m posting this. I’ve (29F)  just been so terribly depressed lately. I work 84 hrs a week just to still work pay check to pay check. All my friends are too busy/far away/don’t care enough to hang out with. Most of my friends have gotten married and started families or worked on their careers which brought them across the country or world. I try hard to stay in contact but recently no one responds to my reaching out. My boyfriend and I argue all the time. My best friend (sister in law)  and nieces live 11 hours away and I haven’t seen them in a year cause I can’t afford to travel or miss a day of work. I’m close with my parents but haven’t had time to spend with them lately. 

I’m sleeping too much. Nothing interests me. I’ve tried to commit suicide three times in the last two years and have been inpatient all three times. I go to a therapist, psychiatrist, and am even trying this new treatment called TMS. Nothing works. 

I’ve called into work all week this past week except one day. I feel awful but I also don’t care if I get fired at this point. My second job is all consuming on the weekends as it’s a 48hr shift. I’m just so tired. 

I’m tired of arguing. I’m tired of not having fun in life. I have no hobbies or interests anymore. I don’t care about much. I’ve tried to get my bf to break up with me because I don’t deserve him. And also cause I just wanna be left alone to rot. 

I was at work tonight and had all my pills out to take. Instead I called the suicide hotline and she listened to me. It helped me not kill my self in the moment but long term I just don’t know what to do. I have no motivation. I just wanna disappear. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Again, I’ve no idea where to go from here. Meds, inpatient treatment, outpatient group therapy, one on one therapy, psychiatrist, meditation, exercise, just none of it works. I feel broken and like I’ll never be free of this pain. "
depression,2019/02/11,"My(20F) Girlfriend cheated on me(24M) with multiple people at school feels like a nuke went off inside me i've been a wreck since  

**ack story:** I am 24 and live and work on Long Island my now Ex-GF is 20 year old Junior who goes to school in SUNY ALBANY. My now EX GF and I have known each other for many years our families are very close with each other. She and I have been hooking up on and off for the past few years and have always liked each other. We didn’t date at first because she was still in high school and I was in college plus the age difference. I never loved anyone like this girl and couldn’t believe I could like someone so much and be under their spell. Our official relationship began over the summer near the end of July. We rarely fought and had great sex and our families were very happy we were finally together. We’ve talked for many years about getting married and having kids.

However, there were some red flags that I ignored early on because I was in such love with her. She constantly talked about her ex-boyfriends(Matt V and Garry, Matt P and Noah) she went to school with and it kinda annoyed me. If even looked at another girls snap or instagram story who was just a friend from high school she would flip out and me. She was made me not use social media around her such as Instagram(unless I posted photos with her) and delete all girls even friends off my Snapchat and phone contacts. She also made me also stop hanging out and talking with one of my best friends who was a girl who was basically my sister. I agreed to all this because I loved her and was under her spell. While I would post her on my social media such as facebook and Instagram. She did not put up a single post of me. Not to brag but She would post up pictures with my fathers nice cars and summer home but none with me ever. I asked her why she didn't post me on social media she's like i'm gonna wait to the school semi-formal to post you and no one has to know my business. She also is going through lots of difficulty with her family. Her father used to be a major lawyer but now is a struggling drug addict in and out of jail. Her mother is struggling to make ends meat to send her and her sister to school and pay her mortgage. I know this a bad situation but she would use it against me to get her way always with things and turn a blind eye to her childish behavior.

When she left for school in late August, I felt everything was fine with our relationship. We shared each other locations so I know where she was. She is president of her sorority and would go to lots of fraternity parties and mixers on weekends. Most nights her location showed she made it back home. Other nights she would sleep downtown were the parties where. I bought up my concern to her once. She said she slept at her roommates cousins Johnny's house. I joked saying did You sleep on the couch and she got mad at me saying she needed space for the rest of the day. I didn’t ask her again when she slept downtown because I didn’t wanna anger her more. Another night she posted a Snapchat story of her kissing a guy on the cheek. This upset me I told her to take it down. She told me she wanted space again and called me controlling. One night I was facetiming her late at night and one of her ex-boyfriends Matt V hits her up to have sex and come over. I tell her to tell him she is dating me and to tell him to get lost. She's like I don't wanna be that girl who tells everyone I have a boyfriend and she told me not to worry she's done with him. Later one that night I check her location because I had my suspicions and she was not at her apartment. I checked she was at a upper class-man and grad student housing complex. I then call her and she didn't answer and she freaked out on me. She made up the excuse she was visiting her little sister who was having an anxiety attack and didn't wanna be at school . But I also had her sisters location on snap maps and she was at her freshman dorm .35 miles away when I calculated the distance on google maps. My girlfriend Told me her ex boyfriend Matt V lived at another student housing complex on the other side of campus and I was acting crazy and didn't trust her. She got her sister to lie and tell me my girlfriend was visiting her at the dorm when she was really with Matt V. She wanted space from me for the next 3 days and didnt start talking to me again until I got her sister from the train on Long Island and took her home.

My girlfriend came home towards the end of September for her sisters boyfriends father party and it was clear going to back to school changed her alot. She felt like she was better and cooler than me in some way and was acting suspicious at the party. she went upstairs at one point and saw her taking selfies in the mirror. I grab her phone and saw that on her snapchat she was frequently sending snaps to this guy George who I knew she had a thing with. She made up the excuse that he was gay and she didn't speak to me for the rest of the party. We had sex later on that night and she assured to me we were exclusive and I had nothing to worry about.

Around mid October I haven’t seen her in over almost month and asked if I could visit her. She said no she didn’t want me invading her life up there. Also she gave some B.S excuse that I probably didn't want her to visit me when I was in undergrad. She began throw a huge temper tantrum like a little child saying that I was replaceable and she would break up with me if I surprised her at Albany. I should’ve broke up with her then but didn’t because I loved her for so long and was going to see her on thanksgiving. And she said she was going to let me come up to formal at the end of the semester. (ENDS UP GOING TO FORMAL in DEC WITH ANOTHER GUY IN THE DRESS I BOUGHT HER LOL!!!.) At the beginning of November her sister who goes to the same school. Spoke to me about not liking school at Albany and she didn’t wanna go to date night later. I asked if her sister was going and she said no my GF(her sister) wasn't gonna be there. I was confused because my girlfriend in the weeks leading up to the formal/date night told me it was gonna be cancelled.

Later on that I got a Snapchat from my GF in a dress and make up which she probably didn't mean to send me. I asked her why she was all dressed up and she said to me don’t worry about it. I asked her if she was going to date night and she said it was a first date themed party. I then text her later on that night saying tell me the truth you are at date night with someone and she didn't respond. Her sister even told me she saw her there at the date night party. Them next day she texts me saying he appreciate everything I do for her but wanted to take things slow with me. Her excuse was she need to focus on school work. I asked if we were still exclusive but she said I shouldn’t worry. She gave some B.S excuse that she wants to get back with me and there is no time frame when we get back together.

I lost my mind because I felt like I did and sacrificed so much for her. The next steps I took were excessive but led me to find she was cheating on me. I DMed her ex boyfriend Garry from school on instagram on a whim. I did this because I had my suspicions. He told she didn’t say ever she was dating me and they had sex a few times together during the semester. Aslo during the summer she went over his house every Thursday while she was suppose to be at work.( I didn't know because I worked in the city in the summer during the week) While she was at his house he asked her about me and said I was just her family friend that had I crush on her but she had no feelings at all for me. He said when he dated her she cheated on him a bunch. He was able to prove it with a screenshot recording of her texting him to come over on our anniversary to come over at 3am and have sex. He said he also saw her with other guys walking home some nights. He also said they she has multiple guys in every frat there that she fucks. Aslo that her other ex boyfriend Matt V lived at the housing complex I saw her on her location that night not the other one she told me and he saw her car parked there multiple times. I also can't believe Her little sister was in on the lies too but I found out she was also cheated on her boyfriend from back home too. Aslo when my girlfriend dated Garry she cheated on him with the guy George she told me was gay. When I finally confronted her about it and showed her the texts she sent Garry with the dates and times showing her number. She went crazy and denied everything saying now there was 0 chance of us getting back together in the future and how dare I reach out to Garry. I also reached out to other people at her school and they all told me she said I wasn't her boyfriend when they asked just a family friend from home and they saw her hooking up with multiple people.

When her mom called me I told her everything about her daughter cheating on me she didn’t believe it. She wanted us to meet over the winter break and talk things out and be friends for now because our families are very close. I’m just very hurt because I never loved anyone like her for so long. I still have some feelings for her because I loved her for many years. Also i'm not gonna lie she is very physically attractive and the sex was amazing(usually it is with the crazy ones lol) I dont think ill ever get and one better than her. But all my friends and close family say she is no good and I must cut her out of my life for good. Part of me wants me to go to her house and start yelling like crazy at her calling her derogatory names asky why she cheated. I'm just so upset because I Loved her for years and how could she do this to me I just want answer why she cheated on me.

**tl;dr: Girlfriend cheated on me while at school and broke up with me I feel so hurt and confused about what happened. I know her and I are done forever even as just family friends but I don't know why but I am still obsessed with her and can't move on I just wanna yell and scream at her feel like I didn't get any closure.**"
depression,2019/02/11,"I (34M) don't feel anything for my wife (34F) anymore.  We've been married 12 years in March, have 2 kids and have gone from broke college students to relatively well off. She's a full time SAHM, but stays super busy with lots of community involvement (some kid-related, some not). She is a very nice and well-intentioned person. She's kind to her friends, generous. She's a good mom, too.

I'm miserable from depression, work woes, my parents' situation, etc. Recently (in the last year) I've left our shared faith due to a number of building circumstances that have rendered me faithless. She was on the couch crying yesterday (I don't know for what reason) and I just didn't care. I didn't try to comfort her, and basically ignored it. This definitely wasn't the first time.  I'm heartless, and I don't know why. I feel repulsed when I get a tiny notion to try harder. I am not mean or nasty to her...I'm just take up space.  She craves physical attention, but I just don't want to give her that.  I feel this pulling away feeling every time it comes up.

I know I'm the asshole here, and I'm not sure what I should do. I love my kids and I pour all my energy into being a good dad--but there's really nothing left for her. We disagree on a lot of topics, our intimacy is dead, and I'm just....blah. She deserves someone better than me. I think the right choice is to leave her, but I just can't find the strength of will to do anything about it. Maybe I just like being miserable.

I'm on some new meds (in the last 3 months) and I see a psychiatrist for my depression--I'm not naive enough to think this isn't interconnected, so maybe I need to talk to her again soon. I tried to call for an appointment and left a message because no one answered. It was really discouraging.

Today I hoped I would get in a car accident and die. Then the kids would grow up with fond memories of me before they get old enough to realize I'm not a great person. My wife would be able to remarry someone better, and I'd be done and dusted.  I'm too much of a coward to actually make it happen, but it sure would be nice to have an easy way out of all this."
depression,2019/02/11,"First step towards beating persistent depressive disorder(pdd) I finally got diagnosed with pdd three weeks ago, but actually it had been going on for almost a decade without me knowing and the damage to my life has been staggering. (23F)
I lost my old self that carefree happier-go-lucky person as a kid and essentially became an adult who finds it hard to laugh at things other people laugh easily about, having a boring, unenthusiastic and unexcited personality. 

So my first step was to go get medicated (again) with antidepressants. 

And today I took my second step. Imma gonna try to do Zumba(hardcore aerobic dance) 2-3 times a week for about 3 months and see how it goes. 

Went to my first class today and I'll tell ya it really does kinda make u feel happier. Dancing with all the people together, trying to follow the super enthusiastic instructor. It loosens u  up for a  short while as of now because it's my first lesson. I didn't feel as tense as I did in the morning -- always wake up with oh crap it's another day. But I'm feeling relaxed and happier at the end of the day. 

I used to love dancing and it was the reason I lived. Then major depression and social anxiety prevented me from being stable in a dance team so I stopped for 5 years, never was the same again. 

I'm doing this because I don't want to give up on life. I know it's really easier said than done. It's so much harder to keep persevering and keep going when u're not sure if you can beat it. Im sure many of you feel this way. 

But regular exercise really helps, even more than meds. So treat chronic depression like any other chronic illness. U need exercise, and u get better with time. 

Just wanted to share this mini progress with y'all. Maybe some y'all interested folks can join me too. Beat depression with Zumba/dance/adrenaline pumping sports/exercises?

depression,2019/02/11,"33F diagnosed with Depression and anxiety. Feeling drawn to risky behavior This is my first time posting here. I have been managing my depression and anxiety well with medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. However, recently I have been dabbling in risky behavior I know is wrong. I am drinking too much, driving when I shouldn't, not sleeping, going to work late, picking fights with my spouse etc. 

Logically I see the pattern of behavior and know it is bad for me. But I can't explain why I am doing it or make myself stop. 

I feel like things are unraveling. Like I am self-destructing. 

Has anyone been through a similar pattern? Any insight or advice you can share would be great. "
depression,2019/09/20,"I don’t want to be isolated forever. For whatever reason I’ve always found it difficult to make and hold on to friends... I’m not easy to get to know. I’m shy and I’ve gotten more private as I’ve (23F) gotten older. I spent most of my high school years very isolated because I didn’t know how to talk to people or make friends and I had extremely low self esteem and crippling social anxiety. I was able to make two very good friends in high school but one moved away after my freshman year and then I moved away from my other friend a year later because my mom passed away. I kept in contact with each of them for a couple years after last seeing them but at some point they each just stopped responding to me... Since then (it’s been 4-5 years since I last spoke to either of them) I don’t really open up to people. I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety for the last 10 years and most of the time it consumes my life. So, I feel like I can’t really make any new friends because I don’t want them to know how sad my life is and I’m afraid they’ll feel smothered or won’t want to be friends with me like my last two friends. But because I never try to open up to people I’m left with very shallow relationships with the ‘friends’ I do have. It’s left me really fucking isolated. Today at work someone asked me if I had any plans this weekend, and I said “Not really. My girlfriend has to bring a bunch of work with her this weekend” And they said “Maybe you can hang out with friends then?” To which I (honestly for once) said “I have a hard time making friends and the ones I do have I don’t really hang out with very often.” Then an awkward pause and an interruption from another coworker and change of subject.  

Thanks for reading if you did. 

TLDR; I’m desperate for friendship but don’t know how to or too afraid to open up to people. Just a rant mostly."
depression,2019/09/20,"A great day I(23F) am posting here for the first time. I have been going through a severe depressive phase since the beginning of this year and also broke up with my partner during that time. Things have been looking downhill for many months now. 

Since the last week, I started dating a classmate of mine, who I've had feelings for for a long time. He is one of the best people I know and has been so supportive and sweet to me. He knows about my situation, we have been close friends for about a year now. 

Just this one week has been a whirlwind of happy feelings. I did have a withdrawal for one day, but he was more than helpful in talking me through my feelings and assuring me that he would not run for the hills. 

We spent a long time together today and it has been one of the best days in a long time. I know it seems too early, but I think I love him (feelings, which I think, are definitely reciprocated). We watched Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, went out for a long drive and ate pizza. I feel so relaxed and usually when that happens is when all the dark thoughts rush in. But now I can't stop smiling and reminiscing today. 

It feels great that I have an ally in my life to help me get better."
depression,2019/09/20,"Looking for advice to give my struggling little brother? Hi all,

Sadly my (22F) little brother (19M) has been having a really hard time of it, to the point where he’s left his second year of university and is currently staying with my older brother in another city. His anxieties started from a deep unhappiness with his “path”, in terms of not feeling like he has close friends there, that his hard work isn’t paying off, his program isn’t fulfilling, crippling self doubt that’s so uncharacteristic, coupled with a recent bad conflict / split with an on-again, off-again girlfriend. His symptoms include a complete inability to think rationally (he sends me long rambling philosophical texts at 3am), and because he can’t switch his brain off and focus, he zones out frequently like the lights are on but no one is home. He also can’t sleep, and most recently has begun hallucinating and genuinely just exhibiting the kind of scary behaviour that points to a psychotic episode. 

Obviously not looking for a diagnoses here, but it looks like he’s going to sit this semester out. My parents are flying from another country to come see him, get him treated, then bring him home. We will all be together as of tomorrow. 

My question is, how would you like to be supported if this were you? He knows my whole family knows what’s going on and has mobilized to help him because we love him so much, but I haven’t yet had the chance to really talk to him. I don’t want to downplay or belittle how he feels, but I also don’t want to make a huge deal of it and freak him out more. I’ve also had my own struggles (a therapist once suggested I was bipolar, but I don’t really believe this as I think I just went through an isolated incident of a particularly rough patch) but I feel like sharing my stuff could be unhelpful - I don’t want him to think that I’m dismissing this as run of the mill or normal, and that he’ll get over it eventually. Do I encourage him to do things that I know would help (ie we used to run together and he has stopped being physically active) or is it better to not push? Would he rather I act normal or acknowledge what’s going on?

TL;DR brothers going through an episode and need tips on how to best support him &lt;3"
depression,2019/09/20,"My GF (25F) broke up with me (25M) a week before I uprooted my life and moved an hour and a half from everyone close to me She broke up with me for being an asshole to her and our lives revolving around each other which they did. We try talking again and it was going well but I just wanted to be exclusive while we were trying to make it work and she wasn’t for it. She says she has fomo. 

She broke up with me a week before we were moving an hour 20 away from everyone close to me and my job. Now I’m stuck in this lease, right next to where she lives now and everyone she knows. So she’s living it up while I have to drive an hour and a half to go out. We lived together for almost 3 years

I really just thought I was gonna marry this girl and that was that but now it’s completely flipped. I’m a good looking guy but I’m just scared I’ll never find that connection again. I’m scared of waiting around for her as well but I’m just having a tough time moving on. It’s been a couple months 

She was honestly perfect throughout the relationship until the end, and it just fucks with me that I ruined it. I’m just really scared I’ll never get over it and never find love like that again. Are these normal thoughts? Will they go away? How do people deal with being with people for 20 years and then divorce? Feel like I would just wanna die at that point 

I’m in a dark place, and thinking about doing something drastic like moving across the country or something but I’m fucking stuck here for 2 years. 

Right now I’m on the verge of breaking down and just want to ask her to hangout because she helped me so much when I had low points in the relationship. I know she would still be there for me if I told her I needed her right now but Idk if that’s a good idea or not. I just can’t take it right now 

Hate my life right now, hopefully it’ll get better"
depression,2019/01/08,"29F Shifting emotions constantly - Am I going crazy, or just need a change?  

Clearly I need to be worried, but I think I just need an outlet for all of this and see if anyone can relate or something? I don’t know.  


The reality: I’m 29F, married for six years, and have a great family support system as well as an education and a job that is stable. Sure, I’m in debt from school, but I’m taking steps to alleviate that and we are on a good path to start a family. My husband and I have a bit of a rocky past, but overall things are going very well for us. We are working to get healthier and are actively trying for a baby. I’m also on 10mg Lexapro daily; three weeks ago dropped to 10mg from 20mg after I said I didn’t feel much of a difference after going up in the first place.   
The situation: Okay, so I’ve been medicated for mild depression and anxiety for about two years now, but these last six months or I have been feeling different. My emotions shift throughout the day, multiple times a day, often in a single hour. I go from feeling completely hopeless regarding my relationship, considering what I would need to do to end things...to thrilled that we’ve been talking about having a baby at the next. I’ll hop on Pinterest to design a nursery, only start trickling into suicidal thoughts ten minutes later. We are planning a big European vacation next year that I’m incredibly happy about, but within moments I will be near tears because I’m nearly 30 and haven’t really amounted to much.  


I mentioned suicidal thoughts, but I don’t even know if it can be called that - I’ll just sort of feel burned out and want to not “do life” anymore, because I want to avoid disappointment. These little moments will linger for minutes at a time, no longer than an hour, and something will draw my attention back to what makes me happy and I’ll be fine for a while again. I’ve never formulated a plan or acted on these thoughts, but I do get upset thinking about how it would hurt my family if I were not around.  


I feel completely out of touch with reality at one moment, but in the next moments I am calm and serene and happy. The rate that my moods are shifting tells me that something is clearly off, but I cannot narrow down exactly what is going on. Is it the medication I’m on, the environment I’m in, an underlying issue? I know that Reddit cannot diagnose an issue or tell me exactly what is going on, so I’m mostly looking for anyone that has had similar feelings. Or perhaps someone that has been on the same medication, or same age, that can offer some feedback. I feel like this post is all over the place, and I’m sorry for that! I’m typically articulate and concise when writing, but looking back this just seems a mess.  


  
Tldr; I want to die sometimes, but I also want to start a family. Wtf is wrong with me?

depression,2019/01/08,"(24F) I’m moving to a new state by myself and terrified. I have a few more days left and I’d love any advice you have to offer to help ease the transition when I already struggle with my mental health. 

I’m moving for a year or so (forever if I love it, but most likely short term) to experience living somewhere new because I’m not very happy with where I am in life. 

Saying goodbye to my coworkers has been extremely difficult and leaving everyone I know is heartbreaking, but I need to learn how to be more independent. My coworkers are pretty much my only friends and since I graduated I need to leave the company regardless. 

The thing I’m most worried about is not having people to talk to about genuine things. It takes a while to really get to know people and I hate pretending like I don’t struggle with depression with surface level friendships. I’m scared of loneliness, even though I often feel it here. 

Please let me know if you have any tips. I don’t know anyone where I’m moving but I’m a friendly person who usually makes friends quickly (when I have the situation/opportunity to). "
depression,2019/03/13,"I’m struggling again... I’m a (20F) and have been depressed for years at this point, the issue I’m having right now is anxiety. I’m 6 months from graduating from my degree and I’ve realised I don’t want to do it anymore. I feel like I’m letting everyone down because I’m fortunate enough to be able to walk into a job in that profession and have worked so hard to be here. I hate this and I’ve taken sick leave for a week and I’m going back to do an practical shift tonight. I’m struggling. The course is an intense healthcare based one and a patient died a few weeks back and it was my first one really. 

I don’t know what to do without disappointing everyone. I feel so numb yet incredibly anxious. I’ve got that feeling in the pit of my stomach and the middle of my chest and I don’t want to do a 12 hour shift tonight but I have to. 

My life’s good, I’ve got a boyfriend who loves me, family who supports me, I don’t have many financial worries and I just don’t know why I feel like this yet again. 

I just needed to get this off my chest with no judgement."
depression,2019/07/08,"I just realized my mom knew I had depression and refused to treat me I'm 23F, been dealing with some sort of depression for I don't know how long, decided to seek treatment by myself when my situation got really bad after I moved out for college. My psychiatrist is still trying to figure out the right diagnosis because all the antidepressants we tried don't seem to work for long, a mood stabilizer worked much better though but it's not helping as much as it should. After two years I'm still trying to find a therapist I actually like.

  


I was talking to my aunt about my and my younger sister's treatment, and she told me how she noticed ever since we were small something was ""off"" with us, she begged my mom to take us to a therapist, she even took me to therapy herself when I was a kid, but it was no use without my mom actually being there (she straight up refused to go), we got worse as we grew older and my aunt was still trying to convince my mom. My mom's response to all of it? ""Go mind your own business"".

  


This brought back memories from when I was about 15, my mom accusing me that my behaviour wasn't normal, that I was depressed and her solution was to take me to some random doctor to prescribe me some meds without actually diagnosing me, and I never took them.

  


She has depression and anxiety herself, she treats it with meds alone because she doesn't believe in therapy, I love her and I really sympathize with her because she's always so overloaded with work and with her responsibilities as a parent of four children with a useless father, I never blamed her for her shortcomings as a parent, but why in the living FUCK would she not try to treat me when I was younger? I'm so angry right now, I'm struggling so much and I might actually fail college, my life would be SO much easier now if I went to a proper professional when I showed my first signs of trouble, money isn't even an issue because we have a pretty good insurance and would never have to pay for anything, just meds. She has depression herself for fucks sake, she knows how much it can fuck you up, why on earth would you not treat your children for a disorder you have yourself??

  


I don't even know if I'll bring it up to her, her life is hard enough already and I don't wanna put a strain on our relationship, but I find this inexcusable and really needed to vent.

  


Tl;dr

My aunt begged my mom to get me some help ever since I was young, my mom refused and tried to get me medicated without a proper diagnose. Mom has depression herself. Now my life is all fucked up and this could all be avoided if she had gotten her head out of her ass."
depression,2019/07/08,"(21F) Living the life, secretly lonely and sad.. Not so much ""living the life"", as I lost my full time job and moved back home. Now part time at a bar I love. However, without being a brag I'm usually the life of the party; who you invite along to make things fun. That's it.

Regularly going to gigs. Travelling. Getting up to crazy mischief and I'm always told ""I've never met someone like you"", ""dude, you're insane"" etc.

Well, that's cool and all.. the alcohol and drugs might've just been masking it all along. Jesus fuck am I lonely. No one ever seems to get close enough to really be ""close"". Whether it's friends, or the multiple girls. Guess I'm tired of being used for just a good time. Kinda want a hug and to be told I'm enough. Being me is exhausting.. This is soppy, but maybe someone to just tell me to stop, you don't need to be crazy party-goer anymore, come cuddle and relax."
depression,2019/06/13,"I hate myself I feel like damaged goods?(22F) When I was 15 years old, this man named Jake, who was 18 took advantage of me when I was blacked at a party. I didn't know anyone there, and they had brought me it was all seniors and college kids. I had five shots of vodka. One of them told me were leaving to have sex I was so drunk and confused. I just said yes and left. They took me to a different house and had me more alcohol. They told me to take off my clothes, and I did.


They got naked and told me to suck their dicks. They were 18 and 19. They tried to take photos of me. I told them to stop. One of them put me on a bed and penetrated me I bled, and I said it hurt they finished. The next day they told all their friends they called me weird, gross, disgusting, ugly and a whore. I felt so ashamed and like damaged goods for a long time. It was my fault because I said yes. They said they thought I wanted it and thought it was okay because they heard rumors I like having sex with multiple guys. I was bullied a lot in high school, and slut rumors were spread of me.

Before all that happened, he was helpful to me and would hang out with me after he would only have sex with me if he was drunk and ignore me the rest of the time. He would never want to talk to me only about sex.



He left for the military over the years he kept in contact with me and saw me when he came home sometimes. He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me. I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond. He always implied that I was attractive enough to fuck but not date. He told me he sleeps with a lot of other women he's hooked up with a lot of girls from our highschool.


Two years ago he had a girlfriend I moved states and was trying to move on with my life. He texted me I didn't know he had a girlfriend, but when he told me, I stopped all contact except for saying I don't feel comfortable talking to him with a girlfriend. For weeks he asked me why I was ignoring him and asking if he broke up with his girlfriend if wed be cool again. I ignored he broke up with his girlfriend I kept ignoring. He started sending old pics of me of us hooking up. It's pictured he started taking of me without asking of me giving him head I'm a teenager. He’ll send them to me sometimes saying ”don't you miss this”


I kept ignoring he got a new girlfriend.  Now it's been four years since I've seen him. He started messaging me, telling me he misses me so much that I'm beautiful and he wants to me again. At first, he was acting like he was apologizing for harassing me and asking to leave things on good terms. I've known him for six years and just wanted things to be normal then he started coming on to me. I just went off. I called him a rapist, a coward, waste of space, awful person. I said a lot of peoples lives would be better if he were just gone that I wish I never met him that he's a sociopath.

He said he was going to block me, so I stopped assuming he would stop messaging me. He lives with his girlfriend they've been together for almost two years. Now it's been three months I blocked his number, but he's been trying to email me. I blocked email it still shows up in spam. He says hey and asks if I'm going to freak out on him again. I keep ignoring. Today he sent me another email saying hey.


Why won't this person leave me alone? I said the meanest things I could think of to him why not cheat with someone else? Should I look into taking legal action, or am I overdramatic?"
depression,2019/06/13,"Struggling with depression, fiancé (37M) broke up with me (30F) because I've put him trough too much. I am writing this totally devastated, I know I put myself in this position, I know logically that I made the choices that ended up my relationship with the person I love the most in the world.  


 Why does it feel like every time I make the wrong choice I am on the passenger seat? Why I cannot get control of myself and make the right choices? Why is it so damn hard to get up on time? Why is it so hard to be mindful? Why is so hard to be productive and driven?  
I have promised him I was going to work on it and I tried, but failed every time and he doesn't deserve to be treated that way. He didn't deserved to go through all of that, I made him go through that and he still loved me. I fucked up once again and again and he will talk to me and we will figure it out, and he will be supportive, and then I would relapse again and convince myself It wasn't a big deal because I will keep working on it. It was a big deal, it was the last straw, I lied to him about something  I thought innocuous but I've had fractured his trust to the point he doesn't believe me or wants anything to do with me anymore. We had the house we were gonna live in, I had ruined that house for him, he hates the home we had plans of building, he told me he hates me now, I have made the person who loved me the most hate me.   
I am sick, I am a bad person, I have made all this choices and I deserve all that rejection.  


I don't want to end our relationship because I love him more than anything but I have failed to show up for him and he deserves better than me. I have no idea how to process anything right now, I am having a meltdown. I am not close to friends and family and neither is he. I  allowed my depression to take hold of my life, to the point of losing the most important person to me. I can't see anything in front of me anymore, I don't know how to deal with anything right now."
depression,2019/06/13,"I'm going to the doctor for the first time in 5 years! *advice appreciated if anyone has any*

As my title states, I'm (24F) finally going to take care of myself. I am so determined to get it over with... I have had so many health problems I have just been completely ignoring. I also need to go to the eye doctor next... I've literally never even had my eyes checked, but my vision has gotten a lot worse the past few years. And after that the dentist, I have a tooth that I know needs to be pulled. It all kept piling up and it just turned into too much... it's really so embarrassing. I work full time, have plenty of friends and I'm even married (long distance). When people notice my bad health or my messy house I just feel so ashamed. For once I just need some encouragement and understanding to help me get through this one step at a time! I just hit an all new low since I came back from vacation a month ago... I live in filth and have been eating nothing but junk food, I literally gained 15lbs. I'm stressed about my taxes I never filed, the money I owe collections, work drama, pretty bad relationship problems, being separated from my dog, a few payments I need to call and cancel, filing for low income medical..... all such small things and it just sounds like way too much and I just cant help but feel defeated... 

Anyway, I take my first baby step tomorrow morning. 

I'm going to the doctor!"
depression,2019/06/13,"Asking for virtual hugs I (19F) have felt pretty lonely for quite a while. In high school, it was a socially isolated kinda loneliness. I was the book smart nerdy girl who dedicated all her time to getting straight As to satisfy a deeply rooted need for perfection and mask the fact that I didn't have a real friend group or social life. I wanted one, but I didn't feel like I connected with people. It didn't help that social interactions *exhausted* me. I remember coming home from a friends house one day and just crying.

Junior/senior year this got a little better, especially when I pushed my way into those cliche rebellious teen activities. Drinking and smoking with my peers made me feel like one of them. Not in a peer pressure way. Just in a breaking out of my comfort zone kinda way. I also developed some friendships a bit more.

Last fall I started college and shit took a turn for the worst. I felt so isolated and spent a lot of time on my dorm bed too depressed to move. I started sneaking sips of vodka here and there. There were a lot of factors to my depression, including some grief and trauma, but the loneliness was by far the worst part. Things got bad and then almost too bad, but I managed to get on SSRIs over fall break.

Going into spring semester, aided by Lexapro, I decided to take charge and try new things. Like many young women, I have a pretty complicated relationship with my body. For a pretty long time I really beleived that no man would ever be interested in me sexually. Like I viewed myself as some sort of atrocity. These body image issues, coupled with a reputation as the not-super-social book smart girl, kept me from being sexually active in high school.

Come spring semester, I did the obvious thing and downloaded Tinder. Don't get me wrong, I'm really fucking horny all the time. And that's a big reason I've been having a lot of casual sex. But there's other reasons as well. It's nice just to be in someone's arms, really. Cuddling fucking rocks. But I still feel lonely afterwards because of how casual it all is. My hookups, whether one-time or ongoing, have all been with college seniors, and sometimes even with guys a bit older. So obviously nothing serious has come of any of these, even though I've sometimes felt feelings. I find I feel loneliest when I think about whether or not these guys actually appreciate my company or just see me as a body. It's funny because I never thought this would end up being a concern because I couldn't fathom that men would be attracted to me. After years of hating my body, learning that I can be attractive and even sexy just feels so exciting. I've even gotten pretty into sending nudes. In the absence of actual emotional connection, I've become kinda an attention whore. I guess the summary of this cluster fuck of a paragraph is that casual sex reminds me of my loneliness but I keep doing it because a) I'm horny and b) it makes me temporarily less lonely.

Sex life aside, spring semester was more socially fulfilling than fall. I got much closer to two of the guys on my hall, and I feel comfortable opening up to them. Not in quite this much detail, but they know much more about my life than most people. And that's been pretty nice. But even with them, I still feel lonely all the time. Like I could be sitting with them spilling my deepest shit and feel completely alone.

So fast forward to right now. Here I am alone in my house while my parents away, meowing back and forth with my cat. Please send virtual hugs."
depression,2019/10/21,"Seriously, I’m not living [22F]
I had always feel this way and I don’t really know when all this started..
I used to be a happy child, with friends, interests, dreams and hopes, extremely positive about life etc.. Now I have nothing of this.
During high school I started feeling really nihilistic, I wasn’t interested in studying and started to suffer from depression and eating disorders (undiagnosed but I used to spent all day in bed just doing nothing, when I wasn’t in a catatonic state I usually spent my day binging on food and then throwing everything up).
I wasn’t bad at school I just didn’t “excel”, I had no interest in it.. Finally finish high school with 92/100 (I’m from Italy, we take a final exam who reassume 5 years of studies) and then nothing.. just survive..
I didn't take university in consideration, in my mind I wasn't good enough for any faculties.. Now I live with my boyfriend in another State, spending my days doing basically nothing: wake up, coffee, shower, couch, hours on instagram watching all the amazing stuff other people do, smoke weed while watching Netflix till 3 am, then bed, and all over again..
I have no hobbies, no job, no interest in having a family one day, I just dream about doing a lot of things: start university (then realise I’m not good enough and I will be surrounded by younger people who will judge me), pastry school (I’m passionate about vegan desserts, but in my mind that’s just “get rid of money” cause I’m not worth it), travel alone (but I’m too anxious to really do it).. just, EVERYTHING! I’m afraid of doing ANYTHING! And I know I am nothing but a burden to my boyfriend as I was for my family before I left home. I am unable to make friends or just socialize with people.
I'm tired. I wanna live but I don't know how to start. it’s extremely frustrating and the only concrete solution I ever found since I was 9 yo is kill my self.. but guess what? I’m not able to do it, like everything else! 

Honestly, I don't think someone is gonna read all of this shit I wrote but I needed to do it.. 

In this overpopulated World i’m only a waste of space, oxygen, resources, food.. My only hope is to find a way for exit this limbo, or the courage to make an end to my life."
depression,2019/10/21,"[TW/23F] Can’t cope with the reality that I tried to kill myself so I’m sharing what happened in hopes that it’ll help me come to terms with it. I’m an alcoholic and I abuse benzos (horrible, I know). I had been drinking vodka almost the entire day and then decided to take, like, 10 Xanax and also a couple Ambiens. It was about 8:30 in the morning at this point and I wanted to die but also... didn’t? I kind of was just like fuck it I’m drunk and I’ll just take all these pills, who cares if I die or not. Fucking depression, man.

Well I guess I ended up leaving my apartment for reasons I will never know (a blessing in disguise truly) and was brought to the ER because someone supposedly found me passed out, unconscious, right outside my complex, and called 911. I very vaguely remember talking to a paramedic and getting into an ambulance but I don’t remember the ride to the hospital or talking to any doctors or any of that. I do remember them making me take off all my bracelets and necklaces and even my earrings and they took my bag (which had my phone and keys and ID in it) and locked it all up. I woke up hours later and had been hooked up to an IV and had oxygen supplied thru my nose and honestly it gives me chills thinking about it. There was a social worker in the room the entire time (I guess this is required by law since they assumed it was a suicide attempt) and I later learned from the doctor that my blood alcohol content was a .283 when I got to the ER. When I was still intoxicated I guess I had told them I had taken pills too although the drug screening didn’t pick up anything? For some reason and after a lot of persuasion on my end, they actually didn’t 5150 me and ended up discharging me that night. Probably a poor decision but I just really wanted to go home. 

But the medical record/discharge paper I left with, which is still on my nightstand, haunts me. They marked the reason for my visit as “suicidal ideation”and “alcohol and benzodiazepine abuse”. It technically was an overdose, whether intentional or not, but okay.

Well, afterwards I simply called an Uber back home from the hospital and that was it. This happened Wednesday and it’s now Monday and I still haven’t been able to process it. I wish I could somehow find out more about what happened when I was too blacked out on my end to know what was going on. I’d also like to know who called 911 when they found me.

I don’t know if I’ll ever truly mentally recover from this. Part of me wants to try again because I can’t cope with it but most of me is too scared to end up in that situation for the second time.

Fucking depression, man."
depression,2019/10/21,"can it just end already I (17F) told my parents that I need help but all they did was scold me for being weak. I tried to open up to them but all they do is criticise me. I have, like, one friend but she can't do shit about my situation either. I go to this place for lessons and my parents are the one who want me to go. They literally don't let me skip it even if I have tests or IA deadlines the next day (I take the IB, big yikes). Well, I feel really unsafe in the lesson place thingy lately cuz one of the tutors keep throwing sexual innuendo comments at me as well as joking about me to like guys from my class, in front of me, as well as guys from other classes. He's middle aged, has a family. I told my step mom but she just laughed it off saying that it's normal for a middle aged man to do things like that. After I told them this, they still make me go to that same place. I can't go anywhere. I mean yes my mom's around but she has her own troubles (financial problems and there's this whole ass drama on her side rn cuz they found out my grandpa has a mistress). I go for these lessons 3x a week and I really don't feel safe at all. What can I do?

depression,2019/04/22,"Bf is depressed, getting worse everyday, refuses to get help  Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but point me to another if so. Throwaway account. Tl;dr at the end. English is not my first language, but I think you will understand me.

My (24F) bf (26M) and I have been together for 3 years now. He is a wonderful, calm, handsome, funny and smart person - full jackpot if you ask me. Since the day we met, he always had that gloomy, sad vibe to him, but you know, I just found it mysterious and interesting.

We've been dating for a few months, everything was awesome, hanging out everyday, having awesome sex life, best friends in general. As the time went by, he was opening more and more about his past (very abusive childhood, was left alone at the very early age, money struggles, etc.) and he admitted to suffer from depression (he has been diagnosed by a professional), but not taking any medication or going to therapies. I noticed that he had some pretty bad days sometimes, when he would close himself in his apartment and wouldn't answer my calls, messages or door rings. Few days later, he would just appear out of nowhere like nothing happened and we would go on with our lives. I always tried to talk to him about it, but he always refused (he would even go home from our meeting if I was too pushy). But, it was happening about once in two months and after that we could function normally. I guessed he just needed some time alone sometimes to clear his head and relax.

After a year or so, those periods become more frequent - like twice a month. Our relationship was still the same, love birds, but had sex only once in a month. Tried to talk to him, but refused and blamed it on stress. Things were getting worse, but he stopped closing himself in and instead just started telling me he feels ""bad"" or ""very bad"". I tried to take most of his daily tasks off of his back (like cooking, making appointments, paying bills, etc.) so he would feel less stressed about daily life.

Now, after 3 years since we met, we barely talk about anything about him - only about movies, reddit, events, people we know etc. When we're not together, we don't talk at all. Not responding to my messages, calls or anything. Just an occasional ""I feel very bad"". Last time we had sex was 7 months ago, and before that, we had sex 3-4 times last year (not that it's the most important thing, but you know...I noticed it). For months now, I've been trying to gently guide him towards therapy, or GP doctor, just to check if everything is alright or if there is any solution to his problems. But he just brushes it off by saying ""I hate talking and it doesn't help, I tried"". Past couple of weeks I've tried a more aggressive way - saying I will make his doctor's appointment, go with him or anything, he just has to get up and put his shoes on. No. Today his only message to me was ""I don't expect it to get better, just give up"". We barely meet (once a week, in the contrary of meeting every day before), talk even less, because he just lays in his bed every day after work. I tried to give him some space, but he would just ignore me for a week and then send me ""don't you love me anymore?"", so I guess that's not what he wants.

He doesn't have anybody but me. No family or close friends. What should I do? How can I show him that there is a solution to his worries and feelings, but I need his cooperation? I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, too, so I tried to talk to him from my personal experience (medications changed my life, therapy not so much), but he thinks I'm not ""that"" depressed as he is.

Tl:dr - bf is severely depressed, but refuses any medical help because it ""doesn't help"". Things are getting critical. How can I ""push"" him towards getting professional help?"
depression,2019/04/22,"I don’t know what to do with myself I’m 19F, and I moved home from college in another state about a month ago. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for over a year now, and I was only getting worse while I was there. Withdrawing was probably the right thing to do, but I feel ashamed and guilty. 

Not to mention, until my job here at home starts, I have the house to myself while my family is at work/school. But I spend my days doing absolutely nothing. I end up binging and watching tons of TV, playing Animal Crossing, etc. even though I want to do something productive, something I can feel even a little bit accomplished for. I’ve sensed for a long time that I have no direction in life. Yet now that I have time to figure things out, I don’t even have the self-awareness, the confidence, or the motivation to pursue a hobby. 

What should I do? Any advice is appreciated."
depression,2019/04/22,"I Don't Know What's Wrong With Me Good day, I'm 24F. I don't have any close friends. The only person in this world I think truly love me is my mom. I think I'm addicted to her. Whenever, she's gone to a business trip, it just worries me if she'll be okay or not. If she shouts at me, I would most likely cry and feel suicidal. Being playful with her lightens my day a little bit. I can let go of any worry I have and cry away with her (except this one.) 
One thing that hit me today is what she's said to me that can be roughly translated to ""If I'm gone, there won't be anybody for me."" I know that she didn't mean it to be damaging, but somehow it make me feels uneasy and scared. I know this will come true eventually whether unexpectedly or not. And now, I'm just crying. 
With that, my current solution is to find a love one who is equivalent to her, or at least, almost the same. I've been trying for many years. I think I have found one, but due to his financial circumstances, he couldn't afford to come to see me anymore, and he wouldn't except my help, so he's decided to break it off with me. Ever since then, I've been all but successful. I think my standards aren't that high either, but most people just don't click with me. They usually aren't back and forth, when I hit things off, or they have an utterior motive. 
 I might be still young to you, but in my head, the clock is always ticking. I know that it's not set in stone that that person will stay with me for live, but I couldn't help but want it. The one think that separates this kind of love to my mom's is it's warm, fuzzy and it makes my heart alive (at least to my head.) 
I have a good job and hobbies to distract myself most of the time. I also don't hate myself as much as I did in the past, and that have helped me a lot. I was diagnosed with depressed, and got 'treated' but, every now and then I get depressed about this stuff. Is this normal or am I being too needy? Is it wrong that I need this kind of validation? Maybe I'm being a coward fearing solitude. Sometimes, I really feel like Chester B was right for ending this pain the way he did, and that I should do the same. It's an easy way out, but it does the trick.
What should I do? I hate waiting for something to happen without me doing anything. I don't want to give up, but sometimes I feel like I should. 
Sorry if it's a mess to understand. Thanks for reading."
depression,2019/09/17,"App to track depression and mental health Hi all, 

I'm working with a biotech firm on an app to help people with depression track their mental health and monitor/manage their symptoms. 

If you have depression, we'd love to hear your input on how we can tailor the app to what you need. We've developed a quick 5 minute survey that will help us create something useful!

Thanks in advance for your help!

depression,2019/09/17,"The serious downs after a good period I (16F) have been depressed for a few years now. Depression isn't my only diagnosis, but it's the most important one in this post. I never understood how I could get so seriously down, in what seems like a split second, after such a good period. A good period being when I can cope with my negative thoughts, and use healthy coping mechanisms for the times I don't know anymore. I can feel true happiness and excitement in a good period. 
But then some small trigger comes by and I feel worthless again, like I don't deserve anything else but being full of hate for myself and my thoughts. I hope that by posting this, I can get some sort of support and see that I might not be the only one that gets into downs that quickly? Like, I become suicidal without wanting to die and I do have seriously good, professional help around me, but they don't understand it like the community does you know?

depression,2019/02/06,"Considering anti depressants I'm 25F Ive had depression since I was 14 officially, recently diagnosed with anxiety as well...

I finally started therapy again in November after only going to a handful of sessions as a teenager... 

It's still 2 soon I think to say if it's working or not, I'm tempted to quit/give up but I feel like if I do I will kill myself, not imediately but I feel like that's what is going to happen... 

Initially I told my therapist I didn't want to be perscribed anything, as I fear the side effects, I always have fucked up side effects from medication... Cold syrup alone has made me hallucinate from less than one ML difference in the dose 

Anyway I'm reconsidering my initial stance on the issue, but I'm not sure if I should or not... I still fear side effects, but I know I'm likely ""brain damaged"" from untreated clinical depression...

depression,2019/08/26,"I'm (39M) so incredibly lonely, scared, and hopeless It's been over two months since my wife (38F) ended our relationship. She was everything to me, my best and only real friend for 22 years. I miss her so much. I want to call and text her but... it's not that way anymore. She's seeing someone else right now, has feelings for somebody else, none for me, and I'm not emotionally stable.

We have 3 kids, the youngest is going to Pre-K all day this year. After I drop her off at school, I'm by myself until I pick her up 7 hours later.

I came home today, forced myself to eat a yogurt cup, and tried to go back to sleep. I slept in our small bedroom closet. It was dark and cramped but I felt safest there.

I got up an hour and a half ago because I didn't want my wife to come home to dirty dishes, unfolded laundry, and a messy house. I didn't want to disappoint her again. But I didn't do anything. I just read on my phone.

I tried calling my Dad, the only family I have besides my wife and kids, the only person I can talk to, but he didn't pick up. He lives 9 hours away so I can't even go see him. I thought about texting/talking to a neighbor friend but I've already imposed myself too much in the past few days. I don't want to scare them away.

I can't see my therapist until next week. I called my case manager to see if they could set me up with another in the mean time and they couldn't.

I haven't worked in over a year and a half and after talking with a lawyer, I won't ever be able to get a legal job again. I would even settle for a job at McDonald's making minimum wage at this point. Just anything to make me feel like I'm not a worthless burden on my family. That I can contribute something. That I'm a human being.

I've been having to ration my medications because I can't afford a full months supply at $30. I take a 10 day supply so I have $20 for food for us or gas.

I desperately need someone to hold me while I cry right now. I had an anxiety attack yesterday and I asked her to hold me. She did but I didn't want her to let me go.

I'm a 39 year old father of 3 and I need someone to sit with me and talk with me, hold me, care for me. I want my wife back so badly.

I don't even have the opportunity to throw myself into a job, save money, and build a new life past this one. I have to rely on my wife who isn't in love with me anymore. How long will this last? When will I lose my kids?

I've been thinking about suicide more and more. I don't want to hurt my kids that way though. That's the only thing that's keeping me alive. But how do I get out of this? I can't even support myself.

And I watch my wife leave almost every night now. She doesn't sleep at home anymore most of the week. The kids get to her and I'm falling apart.

I can't do this. Not by myself. I'm not strong enough for the kids and I won't put this on them.

How do I get out of this alive?"
depression,2019/07/18,"Please help 25F. I’ve noticed that my depression/anxiety skyrocket at certain times in my menstrual cycle. It’s been really bad ever since getting on birth control. I’m going to call planned parenthood tomorrow to see if there’s a different brand I can get.

I want to go to therapy. Maybe even try antidepressants again. But I have no idea where to start.. I have no insurance, quite sure I don’t qualify for state insurance (this I will check but I’m sure I won’t qualify so just assume I don’t for now) and just don’t know how to find resources for anything like this.

depression,2019/07/18,"New Antidepressants Dragging Me Into A Dark Place I [22F] have been on 60mg of Duloxetine for about 6 months, then a few months ago we added 2mg of Abilify which combined really helped with my anxiety, but not my depression. Since my anxiety was fairly under control, we decided to add 100mg Wellbutrin to the cocktail. 

Since I've started on Wellbutrin 2 weeks ago I have been in a very dark place. I have been having the worst negative thoughts about myself and I can't get out of this horrible fog. 

I understand that depression temporarily worsening when adjusting to a new antidepressant is common, so I'm gonna wait it out and see if it starts to help eventually

I know we all feel like people don’t like us sometimes, but lately I’ve realized it feels like everyone doesn’t like me or is actively trying to cut me down. It takes a great deal of energy every single day to go to work and smile and be kind and banter. I’ve told one coworker of my feelings recently and he was extremely surprised, saying I’m one of the calmest, happiest people he knows. And then I come home to my boyfriend and even though he is an incredible guy, it feels like he’s doing the same thing, judging me and calling me out. He isn’t though. I know this has a lot to do with how I was raised and the kind of talk I was used to. Does anyone have tips on how to improve my social energy? Honestly, my current method isn’t healthy. All I ever crave when I get home from work or the gym or family events is a good big meal and then to knock myself into a food slumber.

I'm pretty introverted and hate big loud groups of people I don't know but I'm usually pretty good at tolerating it. However, this time I don't know what happened. That panic from being out has never happened before. My brother(28M) and dad(62M) can't get along making it seem like world war 3 in my house. Ended up yelling at them Sunday night because it's not fair that my mom(60F) and I have to use all of our energy to mediate their little fights so they don't get out of hand. It's not fair that they need help yet I'm the one who has to drown myself in meds and therapy just to be able to function from all the anxiety and depression. And now I can't even function anymore. I'm a medical student and trying to study for my first board exam, but no matter how much I try to calm myself down so I can get through my study schedule, I just sit staring into the corner numb. That just makes me feel even worse because I want to study so bad but nothing sticks. I've always had some sort of depression but now when I wake up all I can think of is ending it because I'm so miserable and in pain. I just don't know what to do anymore.

We've only been talking for \~1 - 2 months and only really became a thing over the past week. This is the first time I've seen her like this and it worries the shit out of me. She's just listening to playlists on Spotify about wanting to die and being depressed and I really just want to help her but I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Copy and paste from my relationship advice post which hasn't had much response yet is below. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

 

Hey, so the backstory is that I met this amazing girl online where we spoke for about a month before we finally met in person earlier this week and it was amazing -- I really like this girl, we just got along so well and had so much fun. Afterwards she let me know she had an amazing time and can't wait until the next time we meet.

However, as of yesterday she's been feeling depressed and sad and says she doesn't know why and I don't know what to do about it. I've let her know that I care for her and that I'm there for her but she doesn't really respond to that. She's also been a little more distant than normal. She's not the most affectionate girl in the world (which is absolutely fine because it's super adorable when she is, and, honestly, she was slowly becoming a little more affectionate over time, but it's completely gone now) but her responses have been more less frequent, and more cold and blunt than usual.

This morning we text for a while and she said she felt worse than yesterday but went on to play some games. I've been asking her to play games with me for a long time but she always somehow says no, but hell, I thought I'd try again and maybe if I could just do things with her it would make her happy or at least take her mind of whatever it is she's feeling down about. So, I asked, and she didn't reply. I told her it was fine if she didn't want to, again, she didn't reply and went back to playing her other game and then went offline and we haven't spoken since (only about an hour ago).

A part of me just feels like I'm annoying her by asking if she's okay (she never answered that text yesterday, either), telling her I'm there for her, and trying to do things with her. I genuinely do care about how she is and I'm doing these things because we're in a long distance relationship and I don't know how else I can help her.

The fact that I can't help her makes me honestly feel like shit and the way she's acting makes me feel like she may break up with me, but then, again, she said three days ago she can't wait for the next time so I think this may be my mind playing tricks on me.

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do? I've never been in a situation like this before."
depression,2019/03/02,"I feel hopeless and I don't know what to do. This is long, apologies. *triggers for self harm and suicidal thoughts*

I'm 19F, I am diagnosed with GAD and panic attacks but I feel like I have depression too.

I have no motivation for absolutely anything. My anxiety had caused me to lose my place in college, to lose my job, a lot of friends, and much more. I want to get better and I try to get better but I have no motivation at all. I barely have motivation to get out of bed at times and if there's days where I have to do something even if it's something ""fun"" like see a movie with my friends I feel absolutely exhausted after it. I also can barely sleep.

I see a counsellor but I've probably cancelled more times than not due to anxiety and I don't use medication because my doctor doesn't recommend it due to my family's history of addiction. I'm also an only child who only really has a relationship with her mother and her grandmother. I live with my mother also. 

The only advice I've ever gotten to combat my mental health is to push through it. But it's the one thing I just cannot do as much as I try. Once I start panicking, it's game over. And then I get extremely upset with myself for failing to do whatever I want or have to do which carries on to the next thing.

I feel like whenever I go one step forward I go two steps back. I feel like a complete liability to my mum and my friends. My mum told me today (and many other days before) that she can't keep going on like this and she can't cope with me anymore and I'm too dependent on her, which I am, but it's out of an irrational fear of her dying so I try and spend time with her and turn it into a positive. One of my friends often call to the house for a chat which I thought was nice but I found out that she only does that to see if I'm OK. That broke my heart. I had a boyfriend of a year and he left me because my mental health was too much for him. 

I used to self harm and I haven't in about 3 years but recently I've had a major urge to. When I was self harming I could function, and Im barely functioning now. I talk and talk to my counsellor my mum and my friends about everything and I cry and let it out but I never feel relief. I could cry for hours (and I have) and still feel the same after it. Im not at risk of suicide, I'm too scared to die, but I have had often suicidal thoughts, I don't want to exist anymore. I can't see myself getting any better. And I can't put the people I love through this anymore. I'm half tempted to put myself in inpatient but my country's mental health system would have me on the waiting lists for months or years.

I don't know if this is a rant or asking for advice but I need to get it out. "
depression,2019/03/02,"I started taking antidepressants 3 weeks ago. I'm experiencing some very weird symptoms, and my depression has gone into overdrive. TW: suicide, self harm. I don't know if this is the right place to post this. I know subs dedicated to antidepressants and SSRIs exist, but I don't know if they're very active and I'm feeling kind of desperate here.

I'm 18F, and I've had depression and anxiety since I was 10/11. My parents were against medicating me as a kid, but when I turned 18 I decided I wanted to try it. So, 3 weeks ago my doctor prescribed me 20mg of Citalopram, my first ever SSRI (or any psychiatric drug). I spoke to my doctor, and due to having a history of sleep problems, he told me to take it every morning.

During the first week, I experienced some side effects that were annoying but tolerable; mild nausea, shakiness, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, afternoon fatigue, etc. These side effects have mostly gone away, aside from the sleep disturbance and fatigue. Although I knew it was a too early to tell, by the end of the first week I was beginning to feel a little better. However, I think that was mainly due to feeling good about starting treatment.

Towards the end of the second week, however, things took a turn for the worst. I'll put things into dot points to make it easier to read:

- My depression has reappeared, but it's a different kind of depression now. The sadness feels different; I feel incredibly detached from myself.

- I feel like my personality has changed. I'm more apathetic than I was before, and my sense of humour has pretty much vanished. My reactions to things are also off as well, I feel like I'm detached and disconnected, and it's like I'm not the one experiencing these events (I've experienced depersonalisation and derealisation before, so maybe it's that, but I just don't know anymore). I'm not interested in anything going on around me anymore.

- My creativity is gone. I used to daydream almost constantly, but now I can't do that anymore. It just doesn't work. It's like trying to have an imaginary friend like I did when I was a child; that ""magic"", or ability, just isn't there anymore.

- I felt suicidal before medicating, and I feel suicidal again now, but it's a different *kind* of suicidal. Before, I wanted to die and was completely fine with the concept of being dead. Now, the suicidal feelings are even stronger, except the idea of being a corpse is horrifying. The ambivalence is maddening. I also keep imagining my suicide in my head, which I did before medicating, but the images have gotten progressively more violent.

- On a similar note, I have started cutting. I'm ashamed to admit it, but fuck it, this is anonymous and I'm using a throwaway, so whatever. The cuts aren't that deep just yet, but I can feel myself falling into the self-harming trap. I just have no idea how else I'm meant to release this new horrible feeling I have inside. I used to drink when things would get really bad, but for some reason I'm now drawn to cutting. I also imagine cutting deeper, and what that would look like. It's messed up, I know.

- I keep freaking out about the concepts of death, the potential of an afterlife/gods, the universe, etc. I feel like my head is spinning sometimes.

- I keep feeling really hot at night. I'm usually always cold, so this one is really weird.

- I really, really hate being around people now. My depression has caused me to isolate myself a lot at times, except I still used to have somewhat of a longing to have relationships and be around others. That has completely disappeared. I suddenly can't stand being around people anymore, and the thought of interacting with others makes me feel incredibly mad. I try not to express these feelings, because I don't want to be a terrible person or hurt people, but I can't help but feel this way. Every single person seems to get on my nerves now.

Has anybody experienced any of these symptoms when starting an SSRI for the first time? If so, did the symptom(s) go away? Are they a sign that my body is not tolerating the medicine? I'm going to bring these up to my doctor when I see him in a few weeks, but I guess I'm just posting to gage how ""extreme"" my reaction to the medicine is. 

There are a few other things too, but this is already way too long, so I'll leave it at that for now. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. Sorry if it doesn't make much sense, I'm feeling really tired."
depression,2019/03/02,"I have no relationships left I have reached a point in my life where I don't have any real relationships left. I am single (29F), living outside my home country. My family and I don't talk much anymore. My mother has distanced herself from me for reasons I cant comprehend. I think it is to do with her own depression. My father calls me once in a while and we have a formal relationship. My sister and I live in the same city however she does not talk to me either. She is bipolar and anti social. We were never close growing up either. I was dating someone last year however we broke up due to his depression.

Anyway, I’ve been on 5 different antidepressants none of which have worked for me and that’s really frustrating. I feel like nothing will help me at this point, so what’s the point in trying? Yeah, I could go work out or go to the trouble of finding a new therapist or stop smoking so much weed but every day i choose not to do any of those things because I just don’t care to, I don’t have the motivation to because I’ve done those things in the past and that didn’t save me or really fix anything long term. I know just popping a pill won’t fix it but I need some kind of relief.

depression,2019/03/10,"Why is depression even invented/ made, and why does it punches me in the face out of no where when I had a decent day in the biggining? (sorry for the long post)  (28F) I have always had depression as I could remember. Early in my childhood life would struck me in the face but I would tell my self that is normally due to my parents. They where strict with me because I was the middle child/ and the only female. Even though I was the “planned” child, I was always put down, and was told I would never amount to anything. Due to there ugly nature I would do the opposite and prove them wrong. Witch made me happy in the end shutting them up. 

Few years later, I married my high school sweet heart and became pregnant with my daughter/ after my daughter was born, fast forward March early in the month, I come to find out my husband no longer loves me, and decides to cheat on me. On top of that the girl is butt ugly/ fat and very bad looking, (I’m not saying I’m gorgeous but I had a fit body/ and liked to take care of my self, I don’t even have stretch marks from my pregnancy) Finding that out I punched him in the smirk face in front of his mother,

I hit postpartum depression with out knowing, I had no one helping me, besides staying at my mothers house but I was paying rent, and my mother belittlering me every time she gets the chance, i somehow stop taking care of my daughter and she end up hurting her self somehow (witch I can’t seem to figure out how) but she ended up with a minor skull fracture that CPS got involve, interviewed all my family and his and decided to take her away from me and temporarily gave her to her father/ ex husband to “monitor my behavior with her when he was the one who left us and rejected to help when I found out she had a bump on her head. Calling him to take us to the hospital and him replaying with “why can’t your mom or brother take you? I’m at the pool with my friends *click*”

After I got my daughter back and taking parenting classes and all, I started getting stronger and ignoring that I had anything wrong with me (mentally) 

Around 2012 somehow.... depression/ anxiety started creeping up on me, but I always thought that it was just because I had a hard day at work ect ect. 

In 2015 my depression hit, and hit bad! Not only that I started gaining weight.. slowly but surely I notice I gained a few pounds, and the more weight I gained the more depressed I got. 

Through out that time my mother would always, ALWAYS, would bring up my weight, and it didn’t help, even though I helped her through sooo much yet I was the bad child. 

I kept working out, but balancing my career, my daughter, my relationship, then tidings up the house it was getting harder and harder to do it. When I would talk to my friends about it or even wanted time to hang out I was always put aside, and I was getting worst. 
When I finally spoke out about my depression to my friends, they.. somehow stop talking to me. And I was left alone, then I was diagnosed with depression/ ptsd, anxiety and I brought up to my family because they kept bullying me they made it sound I was ... giving them an excuse because I was fat. ( I went from a healthy 126 with lean muscle to 148 with body fat, I’m 5’2 petite so it was noticeable I gained weight. 

Now... at 28 and it hasn’t gotten better.. it seems it’s gotten worst.. there are times I have to fight the little voices in my head to not do the unthinkable, I have not been able to make any friends bc I’m very antisocial, but I got the courage to go and try something new something I wanted to always do and in hopes of meeting/ making friends but.. the people who  take this classes are either “price women” aka who have a rich husband and they don’t have much going on or my teachers and believe me, someone who listens to classical and heavy metal music and that works from home I can’t seem to connect to anyways and so I just get left on my own to struggle doing the class. I even try to talk to them and they just.. meh me? 

When my depression hits I hide in my craft room/ and lock my self in so my daughter doesn’t see this side of me, and my bf doesn’t understand the struggle I go through. When I tell him I’m depressed he reply with “why? What trigger it?” Uh.. idk? It just happens! I can’t control it! And goes back to playing games. 
Not to long ago we agreed that if I don’t get better then I would take the “Help suicide pill” because no matter what I do, I can’t seem to get out of this depression and honestly I am tired, really tired that I just want to sleep and just not wake up... 

Because no mater weather I have a great day or start feeling any slight happiness my brain just shuts it down completely and I get depressed and no matter what I do, it just DOESN’T GO AWAY!

depression,2019/04/12,"Irritability as a symptom of depression? Something that has been controlling my (21F) life recently is extreme irritability. I find it nearly impossible to share a space with dear friends, people I once truly enjoyed - now every little thing they do drives me crazy. I avoid leaving my room in my shared apartment (4 other girls) if I hear other people out of their rooms because I just want to avoid social engagement at all costs, even though they’ve done nothing wrong. My mom came to visit me and the irritability with her was intense, I feel so shameful and guilty because I love her and really wanted to treat her well like she deserves but felt so on edge and angry/irritable. I have a long distance partner and I really rely on him and feel like he’s the only person I ever want to talk to, but I even have a short fuse with him and get very frustrated over things he can’t even control, like poor sound quality during our phone calls. 

My mom has suffered from clinical depression since she was a teenager, and when she visited me (on the very first day, before I even became visibly irritable) she mentioned that she always knows she’s entered a depressive episode by experiencing intense irritability. I’m wondering if anyone else here struggles with that? It’s challenging because when I think of depression I think of inability to get out of bed, suicidal tendencies, prolonged feelings of hopelessness, etc. I don’t suffer from these other symptoms in a way that interferes with carrying out my daily life, but the irritability is unbearable and is damaging my relationships and making me feel really guilty and confused."
depression,2019/04/12,"How do I talk to may parents about getting help? I have been feeling awful for the majority of time for the last 6 months and I always thought it will just pass. The truth is these past couple of weeks have been almost unbearable, my motivation is practically nonexistent unless it's about binge watching Netflix and, I feel that everything I do is wrong or useless, basically a feeling of dread that I can't make go away.

I want to talk to my parents and get some help, but I'm afraid that they will either not take me seriously or I would just burden them. They are so overwhelmed by everything I don't want to make it worse for them. Also, my younger brother was recently diagnosed with anxiety and mom once half-jokingly told me that I'm ""not allowed to have issues too""  because they need my help. 

I have really tried to keep this to myself and slowly work towards making it better, but I feel so powerless and I'm afraid I might do something I'll regret. I can't talk to my friends, I don't want them to look at me differently. I'm just lost, have no idea how to aproach things and what my next move should be.

For context, I'm 19F and still really dependent on my parents, living at home."

depression,2020/01/01,"Anyone else overcome with numbness? I’m (32F) medicated for long-standing depression and anxiety. The medication is working, and I’m not suicidal. 

The issue is, most days I’m not anything. I wake up, and I go through the motions. I have a job, a partner and a preschooler son. Sometimes I I find my job and my family enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating. I am rarely joyful, or excited, or particularly interested in anything other than my bed and the occasional television show. Before depression and my subsequent medication, I used to be a voracious reader. I don’t do that anymore. The words swim on the page and I can’t sustain my interest. I used to enjoy conversations with my friends too. Nowadays I don’t have the energy or mental wherewithal to sustain anything beyond basic small talk. I used to take an interest in politics and theoretical discussions but I don’t feel like I have the capacity to do so on any meaningful level now. 

I am occasionally overwhelmed by the pointlessness and cruelty of the world generally. This will strike at unexpected times - when I see the carcass of an animal at the roadside, or a beggar in the street. I wonder whether I will ever have a meaningful connection ever again, or whether I will ever feel anything beyond such numbness. 

My question is, is there anything one can do to break through the numbness, or even soften it a bit? I don’t want to cease the medication, because prior to taking it I wasn’t functioning. But I feel like I’m living a half-life, in a bubble where I am watching everything unfold but nothing is touching me."
depression,2020/01/01,"Seasonal depression or just summer boredom? [15F]
I get really depressed in my summer vacations since I'm very young; about 5 or 6 years old. Even if I have lots of fun, I can't help but feeling sad and eventually crying. This year wasn't different at all; my SO came visit me in my city and I had the happiest week in years with him, yet I couldn't be 100% happy for reasons I have no idea why. Now that he's gone I'm sad af again. 

I can say I'm unhappy pretty much the entire year, but summers make me a hundred times more depressed, I think it's because seeing people happy and having the time of their lives make me jealous or something. I like the sun and its warmth, as well as swimming and doing summer things, however I just want this season to end soon."
depression,2020/01/01,"I’m stuck (18F) It’s the first day of the new year and I don’t think I’ve felt more depressed in my life. I’m in college and have a 3 week break at home, and while it’s nice to have that break, I feel like shit in my hometown. It’s so depressing and just reminds me of how much I hated high school and how I had no friends. 
   Depression runs in my family, my Mom has it and my Dad is diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Not much of a surprise that I feel the same way (also they’re divorced). I’ve been feeling this way for about a year, since my second semester of senior year in high school. I don’t know how to explain it, like I’m definitely not bipolar but I seem to have a lot more ‘off’ days than I’d like. One thing, one moment just puts me off for the rest of the day. Being alone at school doesn’t help either, living in a single dorm and all. Like, I love having independence and doing my own thing but shit gets so depressing sometimes. School is the only thing I have to live for bc I get excited, I want to learn, being on campus gives me a sliver on hope for society. 
    I have 2 sisters (I’m the middle), and we’re all super close. I’m very close with my mom as well, and I’ve told them how I feel depressed (but I obviously can’t self-diagnose). My sisters support me through everything but I know they can’t fix my problems, just make life a little easier to live through. I’ve tried to have serious conversations about it with my Mom, but she just has so much on her plate everyday. My little sister was recently diagnosed with anxiety and started going to counseling again. We’ve seen symptoms when she was younger but it’s gotten worse. She’s attempted to hurt herself a couple of times and it breaks my heart. Since my older sister and I are at college and she’s home alone, I can only imagine what she’s going through. With that, I feel like my Mom doesn’t take me seriously. I’m always ‘overthinking it, being dramatic, or sensitive’. Usually one of her 3 responses to my ‘episodes’. 
     I want to seek help, idk if medication is the next step or what. Counseling sessions are booked at my school, idk how I’d be able to stay consistent with that while going to school. I just want someone to understand."

depression,2020/01/01,"Early Signs of depression? Hey. I'm 22F. There's nothing major that is wrong with my life. I went through a breakup and I don't have a project assigned to me at the company I work for, so I'm spending most of my time at home. 
It's been a month of feeling this way. I have lost my sense of taste. I don't enjoy eating anymore. I'm spending most of my time in bed. I slept for 16 hours yesyerday. Last week was the worst. I had to gather energy from every cell of my body to just get up and take a bath. I'm having countless sleepless nights. I'm just staring at the ceiling for hours. I don't have any motivation to study for my entrance exam. I have some close friends and a family that is very supportive. I'm trying to spend some time with them but as soon as I come back to my room that feeling engulfs like a monster again. 
My mother took me out for lunch on 31st just because she felt bad for me that I did not have any plans for NYE. 
I'm falling deep in this pit of self despair and loneliness. It's killing me. Should I seek help?"
depression,2020/01/01,"I (16F) think i’m going to kill myself. Everything is getting bad again, my trauma and body issues are resurfacing, my relationship is failing and it’s all my fault, i’ve lost my will to live, school is fucking awful (i’m getting bullied and the school couldn’t give less of a fuck), i’m so fucking stupid and depression is making it worse and i just don’t want to be alive anymore. 

Not even my family care about me, they wouldn’t even notice if i disappeared. My parents don’t even f*cking live with me anymore, i must of been such and awful kid that they had to get away. i mean it’s fair, it’s not like i deserve love or care. i wonder when my friends and family will notice that the suicidal jokes aren’t jokes anymore.

i hate myself so much, i keep thinking about all the dangerous situations i could put myself in that would make me suffer.

Every day i fantasise about killing myself. i can’t stop thinking about how easy it would be.

But i can’t kill myself yet, i don’t want anyone to miss me.

Who am i kidding? i probably not even depressed just seeking attention."

My dad has once caught me cutting myself, he did nothing but cry and ask if I was okay, I said yes when I wasn’t and that was that. I’ve had so many restless nights because I’ve cried so much and it doesn’t help that I’m in a toxic relationship with my s/o and I just really want help, I need it and I hate feeling alone like this but idk how to bring this up to my own dad, he’s so protective and I’m afraid if I tell him my true feelings he’d feel like a failure of a parent when it isn’t even his fault."

depression,2020/01/02,"My important friend had an accident since 2 months + has now amnesia from trauma and does not recognize me, which is difficult for me to accept. I \[20M\] have known my friend \[Nikol 21F\] since 5 years and help since i know her.

It's not really about me instead more about Nikol, but i would appreciate everyone's advice and support!

(also i'm not sure if this is the right community and honestly really don't know where to start the story, because it's way too bizarre to understand or believe it, but i'll try anyway)

Nikol was born with cancer, is allergic to the sun, has bad luck in life and is innocent since always, because her parents have never loved or cared about her, all they ever did was abuse mentally + physically and talk bad for no reason, her father is actually not really her father, because she had a blood test and the result was that her mother was with her ""uncle"", her younger brother stole her Nintendo Switch and never gave it back, she never got money support from her parents that she needed for school / university + not even lunch, the whole ""family"" are bunch of irresponsible rude people, the only good thing that Nikol had in life was her dear late Grandmother who took care of and raised her to be an honest, good and heartwarming person.

I always liked Nikol, because she is a wonderful, interesting, smart, etc. person and did everything I could to help so that she has a better life that she deserves like to help her mentally, gift her a good bed so that she no longer has back pain, laptop so that she has it for university, cell phone so that she does not become alone and can talk with me, switch so that she has fun, a rabbit that gives her joy, etc. etc. etc. I know it would sound like a scam at first sight, but for me it's not, because no one really got to know her that well, but i really know and talk to her almost everyday and that it's not a waste so i'm the one who helped out and bought all the stuff that she needed in life and that i really don't care about money or that she never would dare to ask me about doing all that in the first place, but it showed how grateful Nikol really is with tears of joy, because of my kindness. I also took good care (for a short time) of her late Grandmother, paid for a proper grave and promised her before that that i will take care of and protect Nikol so that she doesn't have to worry anymore which made her happy and feel at ease until the end.

Nikol should be happy and if she dies, then everything was for nothing and I really love her and want her to live so I only believe that I can help her and that she needs me, but now I just don't know where to start, Nikol was really (/always) depressed (because her life was already bad enough thanks to her family) + suicidal since the accident which was 2 months until the trauma amnesia started, now she can't recognize me anymore and it's really hard for me to accept the truth, so i would really appreciate everyone's help!

depression,2020/01/02,"I (21F) was doing better, my ex (23M) talked to me, and now i’m bad again. my ex and I were broken up and still living together for multiple reasons, but it got to the point where we didn’t even try to be friends anymore and we just didn’t interact at all. that went in for a few months, i spent a lot of time going out, with my friends, and making new friends and i realized i started improving. But just this past week, my ex started having conversation with me while we were packing so we could move out before the first (today). I knew we had to communicate but we didn’t have to joke around, update each other, and just interact the way we did. it was completely shocking, and i didn’t think it’d effect me so much, but it did. i love him so much, and talking to him like old times made me so incredibly happy but now i’m a mess. i feel like I’ve lost all the progress i made. he left on the morning of new year’s eve without saying goodbye. i went to work right after he left and figured he’d be home by the time i was out. but nope, he was gone, he changed his number too so when i tried to call him about some stuff he had left behind, i couldn’t reach him. this was all a big shock to me, i rang in the new year confused and in tears frantically packing and moving everything to my parents’. 
i don’t know what to do. i feel terrible, i feel like i’m slipping back to feeling the way i did before. i think him interacting with me the way he did made me feel like he wanted to try to be friends, i don’t know. i wish he had just left me alone if he had planned on leaving so abruptly."
depression,2020/01/03,"Bf's depression is worsening - what can I do? Having to use a throwaway because he knows my actual Reddit username.

For a bit of background, my boyfriend (18M) has Asperger's Syndrome and has always had trouble with his emotions no matter how he felt. Over the years, there have been many improvements but if his mind isn't in the right state, the vulnerabilities start to show. Due to my personal circumstances, my boyfriend's family took me (18F) into their home last September.

He was diagnosed with depression last September and he was prescribed citalopram to help with his mood (he's had setrolin in the past and has reacted badly to it). However, his family and I have just discovered that he ran out of tablets weeks ago and had been refusing to take them when he did have them. At this point, red flags are going off because he's always been able to take his tablets when he needs to, even when he was first diagnosed. His mum managed to get an emergency prescription through and she's now going to be holding onto his tablets and give them to him daily like she does with me (I tried to OD last summer so I'm under strict instruction not to handle my own anti depressants). 

He's been missing a lot of classes because of it all and it's getting to the point where he's sleeping more than he's awake (last night he slept from 7am to 5pm, then 8pm to around half 11pm). It's really worrying me as well, he's given up on himself and just shuts himself away all of the time. He tried to barricade himself into his room yesterday, so his mum and I had to try and get him out (this is very much not like him). He also bit my finger, swore at me and tried to throw a packet of something at me (again, very much not like him, I'm guessing it was an autistic meltdown but whether the depression is contributing to the severity of them, I don't know). His family and I are worried that if he keeps going the way he is, he's going to self destruct.

I would like to ask for any sort of advice or ideas you give me to help him. If you could help me understand how much I can do, that'd be greatly appreciated. I'm autistic too, so trying to understand things from his point of view is slightly harder than it would be. Thanks in advance :)"
depression,2020/01/03,"How do I get help? I’m 27F and have had past bouts with depression. I’ve made plans to commit suicide and self harmed but I’ve never sought help and after a few months of misery and self neglect, I’ve always come out of it. It’s probably been about 3 years now since I’ve really felt full on depression like this and I kind of hoped that I grew out of it. These past few days have been absolutely terrible. I’ve been crying non stop, having suicidal thoughts, unable to sleep or eat and secluding myself. All of this for no reason. How do I get help? How do I find a therapist or a psychiatrist?

I really love her. The problem is that I’m feeling what feels like a long term wave of depression coming back into my life and I don’t want her to think it’s her fault. She cares about me and is checking in more because she’s starting to sense something wrong and I can’t make myself bring it up with her.

depression,2020/01/04,"This has been killing me mentally. I don’t know what to do anymore. I'm a boy (17M). There's this girl (17F) in my grade. From September to Christmas, we were in the school Madrigal choir, but it ended right before Winter break. I started doing acts of courtesy every day (holding doors open, complimenting her, etc). She was very friendly and always initiated conversations with me (I'm very shy and an outcast, so this was so exciting for me). We have common interests and I really love everything about her. She even gave me a Christmas present and told me how happy she is that we met. Everything was going great until I got her number. I asked if she wanted to hang out some time and she said ""yeah maybe"". We haven't talked since. School has started again and she doesn't talk to me anymore. I spent the whole Winter break in my room depressed, overthinking everything, and wondering what's so bad about me/why nobody likes me. I have had a very hard life, struggling with my sexuality, crippling depression, suicidal thoughts, and severe anxiety. I thought that this girl was someone I could be great friends with, but my text obviously really scared her off. I found out that she thinks I like her. She doesn't like me in that way. I love her as a person, but I have no sexual attraction to women. I am getting so tired of spending every day just waiting for the next day, in hope that it might be a better day. This girl is all that's been on my mind lately. I have been losing sleep over this for weeks, I over-analyze every encounter we have. Seeing her at school was always the highlight of my day, and I look forward to seeing her at school every day. When she would talk to me at school, it was always the highlight of my day. Now she doesn't seem to acknowledge me anymore. I don't know if it's because she's going through a hard time or if she's just uncomfortable around me, but I care about her so much and don't want our friendship to end. If she knew what I go through/how I really feel, I think she would definitely become my friend. I always want to talk to her, but I get so scared and whenever she talks to me, I'm painfully awkward. There are many things I would like to say to her, but I get so scared of creeping her out that I just stay silent, but I think my silence also creeps her out. Should I move on? She made me feel wonderful (when she actually talked to me). I want her to know how important she is to me, but also explain that I don't want any form of relationship. I'm lonely, depressed, unpopular, unconfident, and longing for a close friendship. 
I need help."

depression,2020/01/05,"Scared I’ll never find a relationship that lasts I (20F) feel like I’m constantly trying to let my friends know what’s going on in my life without overburdening them with my problems. Sometimes I isolate myself from everyone, which pisses people off, but telling them what’s going on doesn’t really yield better results. And pretending that everything is okay only works for so long before I crack. Romantic relationships bring a whole other set of problems to the table. I had a long term boyfriend (3 years) who would ignore me when he knew I was in a bad spell because he didn’t know how to help, so he would just wait until I felt better to talk to me again. But knowing I was being ignored would make me feel so much worse. Eventually we broke up, but I am still afraid no one will ever be willing to put up with me. When I’m thinking straight, I know I have good qualities and that some people like me. But when I feel the way I do other times, I really don’t see why anyone would even want to be my friend. I know I need to be in a better place before I try to get seriously involved with someone again, or I’ll just end up hurting them.

I’ve had to go through all the shit they have thrown at me emotionally n physically n I thought once my parents knew I had depression they would treat me better n be a little more mellow but no. My dad is at work most of the time so I don’t rlly see him n I don’t rlly mind cause I’m not close with my dad at all but my mom is a housewife so she’s home most of the time n I consistently have to deal with her emotionally draining me. She doesn’t understand how to deal with a mentally depressed person at all, she makes me feel much worse than I already am n she just puts more sadness n pain I’m already in. She says hurtful things to me/people in general n when u tell her off she thinks she’s right n just says I shouldn’t be so sensitive. I’m just tired of her she makes my life a living hell, I use to have my brother on my side to protect me or just having him around just lightens up my day. I feel so lost without him now like that 2 weeks when he came back it was the happiest I’ve been since I last saw him in Augest. He’s my anchor he’s the only reason why I haven’t killed myself, I’ve been having suicidal thoughts this pass two months n I’m honestly just ready to end it all so I don’t have to live another day feeling this pain but I just can’t bare the thought of what my brother will go through if he didn’t have me anymore. He’s only coming back in May n that’s 5 months n we’ve never been this long apart n it’s going to be so hard. I miss him so much I feel so empty now and it doesn’t help since I don’t rlly have any friends, I’ve completely isolated myself bc of my depression. I’m just so fucking unhappy with everything my self esteem is 0 due to my mom criticising me my whole life and I’m just lost in life rn. I don’t how to be happy again, idk how to get rid of this sadness in me I’m just in so much pain n no one in my family gets in."

depression,2020/01/06,"I feel I’ve become the black sheep of my family. For context, I’m 28F, married with a young child. Growing up my brother was always the black sheep. Constant fighting with my parents, threw parties while home alone, just generally rebellious and I can’t blame him looking back at how our dad treated him.

But now my siblings and I are grown. And I feel completely disconnected from my parents and siblings. We see each other for holidays, birthdays, occasional get-togethers. But I feel like they genuinely don’t like me. We have nothing in common. They’re all religious and conservative, and I’m agnostic and liberal. I just feel like I don’t know them at all and they’re people I spent most of my life with.

I guess I felt like I’d reconcile all of the shitty parts of my childhood at some point, and now it seems like that will never happen. I think watching friends have close relationships with their parents, I thought if it wasn’t like that when I was a kid, it could be when I grew up. And now it’s like we’re all just strangers who spend time in the same room. They call each other and visit outside of holidays, but they don’t call me and I don’t call them, just occasional texts.

I don’t know why I’m posting all of this or what kind of help I expect to find here. But it feels like I grew up with this hole inside of me that got bigger over the years. And when I finally went out into the world and found a man who loves me in a way I’ve never been, and had a little boy who brings me so much joy, that the hole would heal. But it feels like it’s just cauterized and will always be there no matter how much the rest of me thrives."
depression,2020/01/06,"How to support depressed boyfriend? Been in a relationship  for about a year [25F, 26M]   We were kind of on and off because  of his depression  and his meds weren't  working for him. He was reluctant  to meeting up although  we talked some through  text.   I didn't leave though because  he would be sitting in his apartment  alone so I made sure  to text/call him at least  once a day.   Fastfoward a few months  and he's on new meds and were  back to seeing eachother and stuff.  He told me when he's with me he hasn't  been suicidal.  Things are okay for a little while until I stopped hearing  from him less and less.  Everyday he would send me lots of messages and he was happy.  I know  something's  wrong,  but I don't  know how to approach  it and he's denying or being quiet about it.  I called him but  hung up  during the conversation,  because  I was mad,  don't  know if that was the  right thing to do.  He says  he's too tired to meet up. I don't  know what to do."
depression,2020/01/07,"Missing School, anhedonia and cant do anything I (17F) took a leave from school in 2018 because of depression and bad anxiety and a suicide attempt. I returned to school and at the end of last semester, I missed the last 2 weeks. Second semester has started and I’ve missed the first 2 days. I feel so detached from the world and can’t engage or do anything. I don’t get pleasure from anything and do nothing at all. I used to be very bright and social and at the top of my class. I have been unmotivated to do the load of missing schoolwork I have. What suggestions will help me combat this and return to school tomorrow? How have you dealt with missing school due to depression?"
depression,2020/01/07,"I hate my fat self I hate myself. I truly do. I can’t stand to look in the mirror. I’m 5’8”, 39F. Ten years ago, I weighed 290, wore size 3x/22/24. I lost over the course of a year to around 180. I was in a 12/medium/large. I stayed there a couple years. Then I gained up to 225, size 18/1x. So I have whole wardrobes in those 3 ranges. 

This year, idk what happened, but I gained rapidly. I’ve gained 50 pounds since last April. I still try to squeeze into my 18/1x, but they’re uncomfortably tight and it’s noticeable. I put off getting out my ‘fat’ clothes until today. Now I can’t find them. Maybe I got rid of them all, swearing I’d never gain that weight again. I don’t remember (I do have significant memory issues). I found all the smaller clothes, but none of the bigger. I cannot afford to get new clothes right now. But I can’t seem to lose this fucking weight. I hate myself and don’t want to exist anymore. My life has been nothing but a struggle with my weight. All my life. 

I overcame an eating disorder in my teens and sometimes I wish I could make myself that way again. Anything to lose this weight. I have a consult with a weight loss surgeon next month, but I’m leaning against getting surgery. There are so many restrictions afterwards and my best friend has so many issues from having the surgery a decade ago. Malabsorption, anemia, etc. I also have Crohn’s, so they may say they refuse to touch me because of that. 

I’ve tried every weight loss pill out there (otc and rx). I’ve tried WW, lean cuisine, lose it, all those and more. Nothing works for me. I do have pcos, so that’s working against me. I’m also on 15 different medications, so I’m sure some of those are at fault. But it basically comes down to what I put in my pig mouth. I just can’t seem to control myself. I also have physical disabilities that make exercise difficult. I refuse to be that fat lady in the wheelchair in my 40’s. I just want to die."

depression,2020/01/08,"Failed Suicide Attemped and Now Trying to Forget About It I (24F) have had depression since I was 6. Last year I tried killing myself. At first, I tried drinking Windex but spat that out. So I tried taking melatonin and didn't realize that I wouldn't do anything. A week or two ago I tried doing the same thing minus the Windex. I told a few people and I do know people care and would be hurt if I died I just feel that if I'm not making a difference then why am I alive. So now I'm trying to get my life somewhat together by losing weight and getting a better paying job. I still think about it but I decided not to talk about it.

depression,2020/01/09,"Longing for the sister I never had I was on a 14-hour plane ride from Rome to Miami yesterday and spent the entirety of the ride talking to a super chill girl from Miami \[20F\] who's studying in Tallahassee. We were able to talk about anything and it's obvious that we see each other as just friends but for some reason, she felt like the sister I \[24M\] never had. I only have one brother \[22M\] and have thought about how much better life would feel if we also had a sister who is only a couple years younger. What conversations we would have, what living with a sister would be like, what our social lives would look like, how we would shape each other and change each other for the better. Thinking about it too much gets me upset but I have always felt like I was missing something from my life and maybe this is it. A girl who can truly share, do, and be anything with me and who I can truly share, do and be anything with, as two inseparable chill friends. Almost like brother and sister."

What do u think should i attent the class with my annoying friends or should i go for the trip alone?

Thank you;)!"
depression,2020/01/09,"Chronic illness, chronic pain, anxiety and depression (19F) Hey sorry I'm just going to spill all of my problems right here in my first and most likely last Reddit post. Enjoy!

For as long as I can remember I've suffered with chronic illness and chronic pain. For those who are unsure, this is illness and pain which has carried on for an extended period of time (usually more than a few weeks), in my case years. Recently I have been actively trying to find the cause of my health issues, but unfortunately have come up blank again and again. I am now being sent to a rheumatologist, for arthritis and auto-immune disease. It's becoming difficult to go to the doctor as I'm terrified of the outcome and there is no motivation behind getting better because it seems impossible.
I'm finding an increase in my anxiety, which was usually only in social situations. I now feel anxious 24/7. I think it's mostly because of the uncertainty of what's wrong with me, and if it is an auto-immune disease/arthritis, I've seen how much they affect people's lives and I don't want the rest of my life to be pain and medications. 
And then I get anxious that maybe my partner (19M) will get sick of me. I'm always tired, my mood swings are hectic, and my sex drive has virtually vanished. He tells me he doesn't care about sex, and I want to believe him but it's just so hard considering he's only 19 as well. I feel like I'm making his life stressful, and he is missing out on so much. As much as I don't want to, I get incredibly jealous when he talks to a female friend, or chooses his hobbies over spending time with me. I don't want to feel like this because then I cause arguments and he thinks I don't trust him. I feel his frustration all the time, which just makes me more anxious and depressed that he wants to leave but feels bad for doing so. Sometimes I wonder if I should just leave so he can be with someone fit, healthy and ready to live.
I know he doesn't want to leave me, and this is just the voice in my head telling me these things, but it's so hard to fight it. I feel so alone. I don't have any motivation to do anything. I love art, but can't find the right head space to do it. It just feels as if there's no point. I don't want to live the rest of my life sick, I want to really live it or not at all.
For my job I'm a trades person, so a majority of the time I'm driving. It is increasingly difficult to not do something and make it look accidental. Steer into a truck going 90km/hr. Maybe a tree that looks thick enough to do some severe damage. I get this strange feeling that comes over me like I could just suddenly jerk the steering wheel and it'd be over with. I think the only reason I've stopped myself is my family. I was lucky enough to have a family who, in spite of being emotionally disconnected, they'd still care if they knew how I feel. I have little siblings and cousins as well, some of which wouldn't  understand what had happened. I feel guilty about how I'd make everyone else feel. In a way, putting everyone else above myself has become a good thing, for once."
depression,2020/01/10,"Would you date n unpopular girl? There's this girl(17F) in my biology class I sit next to that I think is cute. She's intelligent, well-spoken and we have a lot of the same interests. I want to ask her, but she's unpopular and bullied a lot. I told my friend I liked her; they said:” she's so gross and weird.” why would you ever want her? She's a loser.”

She doesn't party or drinks at all, but she's bullied and rumored to be a sl\*t. Honestly, because she's unpopular, I lost a lot of respect for her and told her I don't want to be seen talking to her because of my reputation. Would you date an unpopular girl? Are my friends right that sl\*ts are weird and gross? Should I have no respect for this girl?"
depression,2020/01/10,"A Serious of Unfortunate Events... Hi everyone. I've re-written this a few times because it is very difficult for me to write about, so hopefully it will be more coherent now. To give a bit of background, I am 21F. Unfortunately, I feel like I am a very unlucky person. I feel very depressed and upset. Don't get me wrong - I am in a great relationship with my significant other (24M) and have been for 4 years now, I have an amazing family, and I'm pursuing a good education.. but I feel that things in my life are destined to go awry. Like God is punishing me for something. 

It feels odd laundry-listing major events that have happened my life, but it shapes what I am talking about when I refer to my ""bad luck"" or the constant bad things that are occurring. I'm going to list things by grade/age:

* Age 6 - My Mom and Dad divorced. My mom remarries to my stepdad and had my younger sister. My dad remarries to my stepmom and had my younger brother.
* Third grade half 1 - My mom divorces my stepfather, who I became very close to, and begins dating his brother (essentially my uncle.) We move in with him and his kids from a previous marriage and I switch schools. My mom and stepfathers brother get engaged.
* Third grade half 2 - While I'm vacationing with my grandparents, my stepfathers brother dies of su\*\*\*\*\*. My mom suffered from mental illness and alcohol addiction, so this made it much worse. My mother and I move in with my grandparents and I switch schools again.
* Fourth grade - My mom buys a house and moves about 20 minutes away from grandparents, where I switch schools again. She is suffering badly with alcohol abuse and I have to deal with it, often being woken up by her in a drunken state.
* Fifth grade - My Nana, who was my rock, passes away from breast cancer.
* Sixth and seventh grade - My mom is in and out of jail for DUI's. I am going back and forth from my mom's home to my aunt's home.
* Eighth grade - When my mom got sentenced with a longer jail term, I move in with my dad, stepmom, and younger brother (none of whom I was particularly close to) and switch schools again. I visit my Mom in jail, talk to her on the phone, and sometimes write letters. She then attempted su\*\*\*\*\*. She passed from brain complications a few months later. I went to a therapist twice but convinced her I was fine. I really would go again and think it would help, but don't have the money.
* Sophomore year - My stepmom (who I became close to) passes of breast cancer, and at the time we were not on great terms.

Now, to the present day... I've been diagnosed with NAFLD. I feel like bad things are constantly coming my way and am afraid of ever being happy with fear of impending bad luck reaching me. I am in college, but have barely any friends, because I am not even sure what I enjoy doing anymore. I can't find passion for anything and do not have any hobbies. I love to travel (especially to Disney!), but I don't have the money to do that all of the time. Overall, I just feel lonely and scared and often have serious existential crisis' where I fear that I am going to pass away.

I think I am just scared to live, but I do not want to die. I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice on how to get rid of bad luck, or how to find purpose in life or activities? I know it is mostly perspective, but I seriously feel like good things never come my way, and if they do they're quite short-lived. I sincerely thank anyone who has read this and has any advice to offer. I'm just feeling really depressed and do not know what to do anymore. Thank you."
depression,2020/01/10,"A question about what is normal Wall of text alert 📢

Hey so I'm 19F (soon to be 20) and I have a problem.  I've been on winter break for some time and I feel like I'm always missing out. My friends don't ask me to hang out that much though they are probably busy most of the time with work (I have work too but its less hours than most of them). I know that I could easily text them and say ""hey lets hang out"". Its very simple and yet, for some reason, I don't do it. Even when I'm back at college I actually go for months without seeing my friend group (although I do talk to my fellow classmates and we study together and have some laughs). Some of the time, I am satisfied by this and don't feel lonely, but other times I feel alone and hurting (even though I am very close to my parents and we do hang out a lot). When I do hang out with them, for a birthday party or a big get together, I'm usually happy (although, admittedly I do feel out of place sometimes since I feel like they are all different than me). Despite being happy, I never initiate hangouts because I never feel like I want to and it almost feels uncomfortable. And this makes me feel like a really shitty friend since when we do hang out sometimes I don't know what's going on in their lives (I don't text them much either)

I tell this to my parents and they always try their best to help, but I know I need to work on this on my own and stop depending on them (something I do far to often, probably because of my low self esteem). I always tell them the same problems over and over hoping they can fix it but I know deep down that I need to do that on my own. And when they get frustrated at me for bugging them about the same things, I get mad at them and snap. I feel like ive been snapping more and more often as of late and now I feel like the worst daughter too. I just want to be a good person and I try for others but not enough for myself. 

I cant help feeling that I've wasted my life already. I used to feel amazing in middle school, I had a hobby (swimming)  and close friends and everything but in high school I started to feel more distant and left out from them. My depression and anxiety got worse and now its still there (though not as bad as it was in high school) I ALWAYS feel like im wasting my time doing things that i don't even know if I truly enjoy and I know I like certain hobbies (like swimming and ice skating) but for some reason I just stay in the house and don't do much but watch anime, play video games, watch youtube (which i feel has become a bad addition) and read. I know doing other things is out of my comfort zone but I need to try something. 

I am sorry for the long post but I feel like I need to get my life back on track before it is too late and I have no life left to live (im always afraid of losing time, its a huge problem of mine). Thank you guys so much if you read all of this. I love you ❤"
depression,2020/01/12,"She ended it All my life has been filled with tough times, I (22M) had a PTSD from bullying, depression, anxiety. My 1st true relationship ended in disaster, she ghosted me. All my life have I been searching for love and then my ex-girlfriend (23F) came in my life. I felt purpose again, happiness, love and I could finally fully love someone with my heart. We spend so much time together, had so many happy moments, we are such a good match and understand each other, it all seemed so perfect. Sadly, Her ""heart"" still lies with her ex, she is obsessed over him because of her BPD. All this time I fought hard and hard to keep her, I tried everything and showed her all my love to make her realize that she means the world to me, she appreciated it but was confused, she loved me but did not realize it. And even though she still likes me, she feels like she needs to be alone for now and recover. I love this woman with my heart and soul. So here I am, alone again, not knowing what to do or how to feel. It's just empty and sadness, no purpose. I miss her voice, I miss seeing her, I miss our fun times together. Why is the universe so cruel."
depression,2020/01/12,"19F prescribed with lovan but I’m too scared to take it Hi all, 

I was recently prescribed with Lovan (20mg) by my doctor. I didn’t start taking it. My mum told me it was not a good idea and it can mess with my head since I’m not 25 yet and am still developing and that antidepressants can even make me worse. I think I would’ve started them if she had been more supportive but I am scared. 

However I did recently start birth control (for my skin) and that made everything fucking awful. I’m nearly 2 weeks off it and I don’t know if it’s just me or the birth control messing with my hormones still but I feel crazy and I’ve lost sight of who I am completely. 

I guess I’m just asking about your experience with Lovan. What are the first couple of days like? Did it help you especially with intrusive thoughts/anxiety? Did it help overall? 

Thank you"
depression,2020/01/12,"[20F] Curious about switch from Wellbutrin XL to SR + possible interactions with Adderall I've been taking 150mg of Wellbutrin XL daily since last March and it's worked wonders on me, basically cured my depression, I couldn't dream of going off of it, etc etc. Yesterday I had a psychiatrist appointment and he and I decided to put me on 200mg of Wellbutrin SR because I'm starting to feel the effects wane and also I'm having trouble sleeping, which is likely because the extended release was lasting too long. He also started me on 10mg of Adderall immediate release for ADHD which, as I'm sure you all know, I can take according to need. I'm curious to know if any of you might have some insight or wisdom to impart in regard to the differences between Wellbutrin XL and SR, and how you think Adderall might interact with Wellbutrin. (Obviously I talked about this with my psychiatrist and he thinks this will be a good combination but I'd still like to hear from you guys!!) Thanks everyone, all replies very much appreciated :)"
depression,2020/01/13,"24F looking for advice So one of my biggest struggles with depression is the cognitive impairments I face. I have issues with absorbing information, memory, holding conversations, a feeling of being empty headed and major lack of interest in anything. I’ve always done well in school but still feel like I don’t really know anything or remember what I read. 

I know these are standard symptoms of depression but my psychologist recommended I get neuro-psych testing done, she said “I don’t believe this is something you must do rather I think it could shed some light on these long-standing issues.” 

Has anyone ever had anything like this done? My only worry is that if they do find a learning difference such as ADHD then the solution would be to prescribe me a stimulant like adderall, something I already take for hypersomnia (a sleep disorder)... which makes me feel even worse that I still have these cognitive impairments/ brain fog while taking something that tends to make people sharper. 

The testing is $2000 and I don’t think insurance will cover any of it. Is it worth it even though the outcome will probably be that my issues are just from depression? Any advice is welcome."
depression,2020/01/13,"How to help my sister My sister 28F has been struggling with pretty severe depression this past year, and has previously confided in me about having intrusive suicidal thoughts but with no plans. 

Apologies if this is rambling and all over the place. 

I currently live a 3 hour drive away from her, periodically will text her or try to call - she never answers and have twice driven up to stay with her in an effort to show her I love her and she can ask me for support anytime. I now feel that this is beyond what family can do for her, she’s stopped seeing her psychologist, not sure if she’s still taking her antidepressants. 

We have a lot of family that live in the same town that she does, but I’m worried the more people who attempt to help the further she will bury herself into the black hole of depression. 

She has a partner and they’ve built a new home recently - he can be extremely immature at times. For example he’s said to several people that every time someone asks him when he will propose, he will make my sister wait an extra year. I get it can be annoying to have pressure put on you but the only person he hurts is my sister by saying these things. 
He’s also wildly inappropriate when drinking, for example at my brothers recent birthday event he stripped naked and allowed another man to ‘handle’ him in-front if everyone - sister was not there at the time. I felt that was very disrespectful of him. 

It’s been a slow but steady spiral into depression for her, I don’t know if she’s actively suicidal at the moment. 

She’s now not responding when family or friends knock on their door, stating to every question or concern “I don’t care anymore”. 

I’m so so worried and I don’t know how to help her. 
What can I do?"
depression,2020/01/14,"I need advice: My long distance bf (20M) told me (19F) he's feeling depressed and possibly suicidal. Do I tell his sister? Hi guys,

I'm in class right now but I can't focus knowing something might be going really wrong. I've been dating this guy for a few months. He's in Detroit working from home and I'm in Chicago going to university. He's had undiagnosed depression probably since he was like 8 (he's got a lot of fucked up family stuff). However, whenever I suggest he get therapy (as I have for my own family issues and depression) he turns it down.

Last night he told me he's been having a tough week. Today, he woke up at 1 pm and texted me that he's feeling really awful. He's saying stuff like no one likes him and he's so alone and doesn't have the motivation to fix it. I know he has guns and I'm really worried that he could easily put himself in danger or kill himself. He stopped responding to my texts about 20 mins ago and I'm scared.

I know he's pretty close with his sister but I don't know how much of the depression stuff he's told her. She also probably doesn't know that he's dating me but this seems like more of a pressing issue than possibly revealing our relationship to her even if he weren't ready to share. I don't want to embarrass him but I'm worried about his safety. I'm thinking of sending her a DM over instagram saying something like: ""Hi \[Her Name\], I don't know if you know me but I've been seeing \[His Name\] for a few months. He's been telling me some pretty worrying stuff for the past week and I'm scared he's feeling depressed and alone. I'm in school in Chicago and can't come see him, but I was thinking you might want to check on him."" Does that sound like a good idea?

TL;DR: My long distance boyfriend is saying he's depressed and possibly suicidal. Should I tell his sister (who I don't know) to go check on him?"
depression,2020/01/14,"I (21M) can't stop feeling guilty for cheating on my girlfriend (23F) unless I get hit. I've been depressed for a long time, I often feel numb and could go days or weeks without talking to anyone, I only break out of it when I'm forced to. But, recently, my ex-girlfriend, of 8 months, broke up with me because I drunkenly made out with a guy at a party (I'm bisexual) and didn't tell her, she only found out when someone there told her and my depression has only got worse, I'm not numb anymore, I just feel guilty and psyically sick. But what makes me feel worse is the way I process that guilt, I know it's messed up and unhealthy but it's the only way it works.

I deserved to be broken up with, I cheated and I'm an asshole, I know that. I was never a good boyfriend even before this. So, we broke up but a few days letter she messaged me that she forgives me and we should stay friends. Even though she said she forgives me I don't think I deserve her forgiveness and her saying that just made me feel even more guilty because I know I hurt a kind person.
I was brought up by pretty aggressive people where when you upset/angered/betrayed someone, you got hurt even if it wasn't always deserved. Now I think I genuinely deserve to get hurt and I think its the only way to stop me feeling guilty. But, I know she would never hit me, even if I asked her to.
So, I asked a mutual friend (26M) that we met through. This mutual friend is much more than a friend to me, he's the person I trust the most with anything and he's helped me so much in life in ways I can't even describe. So, I explained to him how I was feeling and asked if he'd hit me. He just went with a flat no and said he'd never do that. I tried to rile him up and get him angry at me so he would, but he's never really got angry with me and it didn't work. I don't want to be properly beaten up, I just want to get properly slapped. I have a few other friends, who probably wouldn't even if I asked, but I don't think they'll stop my guilt in the same way.
I don't know what to do. It's been almost 2 weeks since we broke up and a couple days since I asked the mutual friend and I just feel like I've been festering. I live with the mutual friend and I feel even more guilty every time I see him, he looked so disappointed when I told him why we broke up. He keeps saying that it's okay and that I shouldn't feel bad because she forgives me but he won't do what I asked to help me feel better. I've seen my ex a few times since then as well, only with other people there, and just can't enjoy myself because I can't think about anything other than seeing her cry when she confronted me about it.

I want to go back to feeling okay, even if okay is just numb. And the way I think I can do that is so messed up and I know that, which just makes me feel worse. I know it's messed up to ask my friend do that, as people on another sub have said but I just want to feel better.
Any advice?"
depression,2020/01/15,"I guess I just need to let some stuff out Sorry if this kind of goes all over the place or is confusing. 

I guess I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for the better part of 3 or so years. Most of it, I think, ends up revolving around school. I've never been diagnosed or anything and I always felt it got better eventually so I never really reached out to a therapist or doctor or anything.

I(25M) just entered my last semester of college. I was ecstatic. I graduated high school in 2012 and have been struggling to finish, balancing working full time and school. Every semester, around the beginning mostly but several times throughout, I start to get a lot of anxiety and I get really sad about everything. The work seems overwhelming and I can't help but think of all the time I have to dedicate to do well and how I won't have time for myself really. I end up working all day, doing homework when I get home, walk my dog and play with him a little because I feel bad neglecting him but he is my best friend, and then usually watch some TV before bed. My off days from work are filled with school and classes so it feels like I never get a break. 

This time, when I started the semester on Monday, I was welcomed with a ton of work for the semester and a ton of work for the first assignment. I would say maybe 3 weeks of work and research due in 1 week. Not to mention, I still have other classes that start on Thursday. I was really really hoping for an easy last semester with maybe one class that requires a lot of work but now it seems like this semester will be the hardest yet. I should mention, I go to school for digital media. Lots of design work and branding and marketing. Especially marketing and branding ourselves. Lots of projects and research. 

I know it's not the end of the world, lots of people have a ton of work for college. There are harder degrees out there. But for some reason, this really really affected me. I had a panic attack after class and sobbed in my car for some reason. 

Not sure if this has anything to do with anything, but I also slammed my finger in my car door last Thursday and it's been healing slowly. Doctors basically just tell me that you just have to let it heal on its own but it's been giving me a lot of anxiety. 

Anyways, after Monday, I just felt worse than I ever have before. I've been so depressed it's been hard to do anything. At work I'm quiet and keep to myself. Once I get home I'm tired and just wanna lay down and nap. Yesterday instead of working on homework when I got home, I just felt so exhausted I fell asleep on the couch. I had to force myself up to walk and feed my dog. I haven't had any appetite and have been forcing myself to eat because I know I need to eat something. I've hardly been eating anything though. Parts of sandwiches, some fries maybe and then I feel full or nauseous and can't finish it. 

This is worse than I've ever felt and I can't seem to shake it. I just want to feel normal again and I don't want to be sad and tired all the time. My fiancee(23F) has been very supportive but we are in a long distance relationship until this summer. She's been away for over a year now and I proposed back in October. She tries to talk to me as much as she can but throughout the day she is at work and of course gets busy. I totally understand that. But I really look forward to getting her messages because it makes me feel just a little better. I'm really hoping that after this week or so things start going back to normal. I keep telling myself it's only 4 more months and I'll be done and all my hard work will have paid off, but I just can't seem to feel better. I cry in the morning, on my lunch break, on my way home from work, and once I get home. I just wish there was a way to make this just go away. 

Again, sorry if this was all over the place or hard to understand. I just felt like I needed to get it off my chest as I don't really have many people to express these feelings to and I don't want to overwhelm my fiancee because she isn't a therapist. She doesn't deserve to bear the weight of her stress and also mine. 

Anyways, thanks for reading I guess. And thanks for having this place available"
depression,2020/01/16,"Be Still My Heart...Literally (Venting, Sorry) I (26F) had been diagnosed with depression since I was 12 years old. I’ve also be saddled with bi-polar disorder, anxiety, and PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). I have attempted to end my life 5 times. All failed. (duh, obviously). I didn’t plan to live past 25. My 26th birthday was last week and I feel very lost. I’m unmarried, can’t seem to accomplish a relationship unless it’s a FWB or a hook up (don’t want either), I work in a horrible job and I want to leave but I can’t seem to even get an interview for other jobs. I have a bachelors in theatre and I’m passionate about it, yet my confidence is shot dead. 

I’m very hard on myself because I am petrified of failing. When I do fail, it’s the end of the world. I do have a temper, but I do my best to keep it under control. Sometimes, it’s just not by choice when I get upset.

I’m kind, I’m funny, I’m understanding, I’m not ugly I don’t think. I have long straight red-brown hair, hazel eyes that are actually rather pretty, pale skin, and small hands and feet. I have an hourglass figure (YES, I have some extra weight on me (5ft 2 in @ 185 lbs) but fervently trying to lose some weight), I’m intelligent, and yes I’m good at sex due to lots of (safe) practice.  

But I find I’m extremely insecure the more I like someone so I become bossy and jealous when I don’t realize. I can appear to be confident and outgoing, but when I’m alone, I’m the most dark and depressing person, constantly attacking myself. I feel like no one actually likes me, I’m a burden and exhausting to anyone I talk to, and I really do think I’m better off dead since my belief in true love and trust is gone. I’m still the same lonely, single person while ALL my friends are getting married, having babies, and going about their lives. 

Even my younger siblings have been in relationships longer than 3 years. My longest was 6 months. It’s my moms favorite joke that I don’t like people so I do my own thing. I attract crazy or old or selfish people, that’s why I have trouble daying. I don’t think I was meant to find love and I can’t seem to live with knowing I won’t be someone’s loving wife or a child’s mommy. It breaks my heart and I try not to think about it, but it’s getting harder and harder to ignore how desolate I feel."
depression,2020/01/16,"I (23F) have been struggling a lot with being so easily exhausted by my relatively non complex life and don’t know how to keep treading water let alone progress at all in life. As the title says, I’m a 23yo female with what should be a pretty okay existence. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for almost 10 years now in varying degrees and it caused me to drop out of college but I now at least have an apartment with my SO of two years and have held the same okay paying retail gig during that time. But for months now I’ve felt the backward slide begin.

I’ve begun having panic attacks at work again (in the employee restroom so at least i’m not interfering) and absolutely dread going there every day and when I get home (early afternoon) I can never even muster the ability to do much of anything productive, audiobooks and sudoku are my mind distracting go to just to waste time until bedtime. But I dread my few days off too. Everything feels overwhelming for no reason. My boyfriend has to remind me of everything from refilling my meds to paying our rent and I even procrastinate basic self care like showers for more days than I should (dry shampoo and cleansing wipes yo) because it takes such an effort. 

I’m maintaining so poorly now that any idea of the future sends me into a spiral. I have no career drive or certification no real ambitions or goals and I can’t afford therapy (but have tried it in the past). I just feel so thoroughly exhausted and sick of the fact that almost everything overwhelms me and have no idea where to go from here. I’m just so tired. 

Sorry for the wall of text/vent and lack of specific question I guess I’m mainly looking for advice or even a sympathetic high five at this point."
depression,2020/01/16,"depression is ruining university for me - please help? my mental health is ruining university for me and I don't know what to do. I'm 19F in first year studying a very intensive course. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to redo this year because I'm about to hand in a half-finished project, late, that's a big part of this year’s grade. I feel so utterly disgusted with myself for letting this happen, I’m overcome with guilt and shame and I’m really not sure what to do.  


As some background no-one asked for lol, I’ve had mental health issues forever but I’ve never really had the help or support I needed. I’m fairly sure I’m depressed and have been for a while, people have been telling me for years that they think I’m depressed and need help, but only over the past year or so have I come to terms with it and accepted it. My GP has reccomended I start on antidepressants but I’m just terrified. I said I’d think about it and go back but I never did. I’m too afraid to. I’ve used up all the free counselling I’m elegible for with uni and I can’t afford to buy any. My old therapist said she believed I needed long-term help and support to revover. My family won't help - I don't have a great relationship with them and they besides they don't really 'believe' in mental health issues anyway. I do have an autism assessment coming up though, so hopefully that could help.  


I have no friends, I can’t talk to people, I don’t want to do anything but lie around and sleep, I constantly feel so ashamed and guilty and it’s exhausting. I want to find some way to express to my lecturers that it isn’t because I’m lazy or totally incapable, it’s because I’m ill. But I’m not diagnosed with any condition officially, though, so I have no basis for a special consideration and really there’s no reason for them to believe me. What do I do? Just tell them anyway? But what if they think I'm some freak making excuses?

&amp;#x200B;

Worst thing is that I worked hard to get on my course, and I care so much about doing well. I feel like I'm watching everything slip away and I'm letting it go. I'm just too tired, I don't know what to do, I feel like I can't fight anymore. Sorry to post here but I hope someone has had a similar experience and can help me. Thank you so much for your time anyway, and I hope you have a lovely day."
depression,2020/01/16,"Everything is numb First post on reddit after a few years lurking, so sorry if this is not allowed or I did something wrong. 

It's week 2 back this semester of college and I (21F) am so depressed I can barely make it to work, much less class. I can't focus and barely leave my apartment or do more than lay in bed or sit at my kitchen table forcing myself to eat. I know I won't kill myself because I couldn't do that to my mama, but I've started self-harming again after being clean for a few months. I was just fine last week through Sunday, but Sunday night, I was hit with a bad case of depression. I've had depression this bad near the middle/end of the semester and I haven't been able to get out of the slump until after finals usually.

One trigger I think was that my friend told me their sister killed themselves. Idk maybe I started imagining what it would be like to be me? Not sure. This slump also happened last time I heard someone on campus had killed themselves, despite not knowing either person. 

Idk why I'm posting this. Maybe someone can fix me. I'm tired of being tired and numb and so empathetic/influenced by other's lives and deaths.

I'm on antidepressants, trying to eat healthy, and trying to go to the gym 2x a week, I just don't know how to get over this."
depression,2020/01/17,"30F feels like the world just shit on me Hello there all, first time posting. I'm depressed af. My financial situation has been terrible and just now was starting to bounce back. I missed a lot of work due to illness and my fiancé has had to help a lot with finances. This paycheck I was hoping to start coming back from me missing so much work and be able to start paying my fiancé back.

The weather where I live has been very bad today. Rain, sleet ice, road conditions have been terrible. So I called into work for my own safety but decided a 5 minute drive to get groceries wouldn't be too bad. I was incredibly wrong.
I got into a car accident followed by me slipping and bashing my head/chipping my tooth.

I don't know what's going to happen with my car since it was my fault. I don't know if I'll need to buy a new car or not. So on top of that I had to let my parents know because I am using their discounts  (multi car, home owners insurance etc. ) through their insurance company. Im not sure if this will affect their rates or not.

So along with the accident I'm going back to school but my parents don't support me. They're concerned because the school is a bit of a drive and they don't trust my driving.

 I drove carelessly in my early 20s and that seems to have marred their thinking about my driving now. Despite this being my first accident in 5-6 years. I don't have friends, my family is not supportive. I just have my fiancé.

So dear reddit user, I am posting here because I feel like I'm in this dark pit and am not coming out of it. I feel like I have no support and am falling slowly back down. Today has been terrible. and some days I just don't want to be here anymore."

depression,2020/01/17,"Advice for GP visit? Hi,
I'm (24F) going through a lot of stuff at the minute and really feel like I need to speak to my GP or professional pretty soon. 
I know I'm depressed and I feel like nows the time I need to talk to someone who isn't family. They just don't seem to understand and say unhelpful things like 'try to stay positive'.

The only thing is, I have severe anxiety too, so the thought of sitting in the GPs room and bringing my mental health up makes me very uncomfortable. I cry when I try to rehearse what I'm going to say (I find it hard to put together the right words when I'm super anxious) and I don't want to do that in front of the Doc, and feel like just saying I'm depressed' isn't the right way to do it.
I read about possibly writing a list of things I want to say incase i forget, has anyone done that?

Does anyone have any advice on how I can bring it up to my doctor? Or has anyone done it a particular way which made them feel more comfortable? 
I appreciate any advice guys. Thanks."

Today I was just walking around and did three simple errands that took all of 2 hours if that but I was exhausted. I didn’t have anymore energy to do anything so I just went home and spent the rest of the day in bed recovering. It’s because there’s a war going on in my head.

I’m constantly fighting off passive suicidal thoughts (aka suicide ideation), always having to tell myself to live in the moment and things are better comparatively even though it never actually feels like it. I’m trying to not let good times pass me by because I’m thinking it’s all bad or ignoring the good parts. And after all that fighting I’m too tired. I’m too tired to really focus in on my classes or any of the important shit I gotta do in order to be something.

I wish sometimes I lived in an alternate reality where it isn’t required to have a college degree to make good money. I don’t want to be the next Bill Gates, I just want a comfortable nondescript life.

I discovered that i have a issue with ""Romance"".Everytime when i start watching a show or a movie on Netflix or some other platform and i see even a tiny bit of romance in the show/movie its just ruined for me. I legit cant watch it anymore i have to close it and never watch it again   
My bitterness and lowkey hate for peoples happiness just gets triggered.

(A small backstory about my life) Disclaimer: English is not my first language since im from Finland but ill try my best also im sorry if my grammar is gonna cause you a stroke.

 I was diagnosed with severe depression when i was 13 and before that i was diagnosed with NLD and ADHD and mild autism and people haven't really treated me well if you don't count in my parents  
i never had any issues at home or anything like that but outside my home i never really fit in a any mold or form of society. I was bullied a lot at school and outside of home mostly because of how i looked (i was pretty chubby during the ages of 10-16) and how i behaved since i didn't have any sort of filter for things that i said or my behaviour in general and i really have to salute my parents for tolerating my shithead behaviour during those ages. When i was 15 i started to date this girl with a lot of mental problems and she meant the world to me i got really attached to her i did a lot for her and i was there for her when no one else was and i was the one who helped her get better since the life in her household was pretty terrible (her mom left her when she was a kid and her dad was a drug/alcohol abuser). We dated around 2 years and in those 2 years i did everything to help her overcome her social anxiety and cope with depression. We never had any major problems and she became like a part of our family my mom would even treat her like her own daughter but 2 people with mental problems really shouldn't date.  
Anyway she ended up cheating on me with 2 times 1st time i forgave her since she convinced me that she was drunk and didn't think clearly and was just horny and because i loved her so much and didn't wanna leave her (which was dumb) After that she did it again and i was so heartbroken and i didn't really handle it well..  So she ended leaving me pretty scarred and damaged its been 5 years since that happen'd but i still often find myself thinking about her and if she is happy or enjoying the life she has. It was really hard for me to move on and actually try to meet new people and even try to find a new Girlfriend which i eventually did find but we didn't last very long (3 weeks). I guess im just unable to properly let people go and keep living in those same old stupid memories of people that never actually loved me. I guess im still bitter for giving too much of myself only it to be thrown away like a cigarette bud. ---&gt; Song relates  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FLptM4Tig4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FLptM4Tig4)"

depression,2020/01/20,"Can’t stop eating to make myself feel better, and spending money I don’t have, anyone else do that? I’m 35F. I’ve always been bad with money, growing up we didn’t have much, so once I was educated and started working, I didn’t deprive myself of anything I wanted, and it made me feel really good and happy.  I have continued to be this way my whole life, even after marriage, and buying a house and kids etc, never got into debt, but to my husbands frustration was never capable of saving any money either,  just recently started medication for depression and anxiety, because I finally got to a point where I knew I needed to seek help, and now I am in debt, by a few thousand, because of my “spending to get happy” habit getting out of controI. I think it’s a coping mechanism.  Even though the medication has helped me loads,  I am still in a constant state of subdued depression and therefore am still constantly seeking out those instant rises. I’m spending money I don’t have,  and I need to stop but don’t know how,  something else will need to replace the spending but what? I have the same issue with eating, I’ve always been very slim. but these last two years where my anxiety and depression seemed to peak, I have put on a lot of weight,  when I’m not spending money I don’t have, i eat food that I shouldn’t be eating.  Mostly junk food, because it makes me feel instantly better, that lasts about 5 minutes because I  then start to feel guilty and annoyed with myself for caving in! 🤦🏻‍♀️😫  I know losing weight would make me feel better for longer, cuz I’ll look good, and that will boost my  confidence, and my appearance right now is one of the big things that gets me down, but i can’t seem to break this cycle of eating and spending to make myself feel better.  Don’t know what to do. Oh I also pick the skin around my nail bed, to the point of maki g them bleed. I started having regular manicures done to tackle that at the same tome of starting my medication, and it has helped a lot, I do still have the urge to pick my skin but I’m able to resist more from fear of ruining a manicure I paid money for lol!"
depression,2020/01/20,"I (17F) have, today, for the first time in a while, planned my suicide in my head. I was in philosophy class, per usual

No one gave a fuck, per usual
And I was lost in my thoughts, per usual.

You know, that huge feeling, that oppresses your chest and makes you wanna explode, ripe your hearth out so you don't feel anything anymore ?
Well, that.

Just fought with my boyfriend, my ""group of friends"" in my classroom do not give a fuck about me and I think that's because they don't really like my bf ? In any ways, they are amazingly rude and it is just so hurting.

I felt so intensly overwhelmed. And when I'm overwhelming... I feel suicidal.

I just laid on my desk, head in my arms, and it just flashed in my head.
Fuck, it would have felt so good to actually be dying. Like, I don't know, taking a lot of meds, or just laying in the bathtub and cutting my wrists open, slowly passing out in the warm water, the music I like in the background.
That just sounds like such a relief.

I hate myself, and just my life lately.

And I hate myself even more because I don't really have any reason to be sad. I'm just a fucking unhappy brat.
And when I think about all the pain my family and my boyfriend would feel if I did that, I just hate myself even more for being so selfish.

I'm just so lost. Life just doesn't feel like it is actually worth living.
I can't understand the point...

depression,2020/01/20,"used to have a fear of death and now casually suicidal... lmao the irony Hi, I don't know if anyones gonna read this, but I just really need to put my thoughts down into words. 

I'm 18F, and I've had a really bad outlook on death/mortality my entire life. When I was about seven, I used to be unable to sleep because I would contemplate the shortness of my life against the infinity of time. At the time the only way I could reasonably reconcile my limited time on this earth was placing immense pressure on myself to be ""successful,"" so I would have a long-lasting legacy when I inevitably passed. And I just developed a really toxic perfectionist attitude and a lot of general anxiety.

When I got older, this fear really started fucking with my mental health. I don't know exactly when it started but I started imagining vivid ways to kill myself whenever I felt anxious or like a failure. And it really messed me up, because my coping mechanism was basically a fantasy of the thing I feared the most. In high school I began developing (more so recognized) my internal philosophy that we are all not unique (in ways that are significant), which basically ruined the remaining shreds of my self-confidence and will to live. 

Now, I feel like I've reached a certain point of apathy where I'm just in a state of being ""casually/passively"" suicidal. I can't bring myself to commit suicide because I would feel so guilty doing so, but I really just want to go to sleep one night and never wake up. I guess I still have some hope for success since I am young, but every minor setback just seems so amplified in my mind and causes me to go down a slippery slope and I end up just wanting to die anyways.

The shittiest thing is there's literally no reason for me to feel this way; I can't pinpoint any traumatic childhood event that triggered this fear of death or led to this point of constantly wanting to die. I come from a decent family, with two parents and a pretty stable household. I guess the only negatives are that my dad was always pretty volatile and constantly criticizing me; and my mom would just avoid me when I used to have breakdowns and cry (not in a neglectful way though.. it was just her way of de-escalating the situation, but I do resent her a little for it). I just really don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to live because everything seems daunting and requires too much effort, but I really can't bring myself to kill myself either. And there's this added element of fearing death, and feeling guilty about not really having a reason for wanting to die in the first place... I dunno, I guess I'm just confused. 

tldr; confused teen who used to fear death and is now passively suicidal and just generally unable to cope with life."
depression,2020/01/20,"Feeling hopeless after a falling out Hey all. I (26F) am basically at the end of my rope. I have struggled with depression for most of my life. It has been varying degrees of manageable but lately it has been getting harder and harder.  I recently had a falling out with an online community I cared about very much. It was mostly my fault. It is hard to not feel the sense that I am fundamentally a bad person. Sorry for the lack of details, I am just frustrated and lonely."
depression,2020/01/20,"My Life’s at a standstill I (27F) graduated from college a few years back but still haven’t found a job with my degree. i’m working a job that’s no longer challenging, i hate going, and hate that i feel stuck there. any entry level jobs with my degree make $10-12 less an hour than i’m making now and i can’t justify that kind of pay cut. 

I don’t have many friends. i’ve never dated, not because i don’t want to but because i haven’t found anyone and no one has ever been interested. I haven’t put in a lot of effort though. i’m depressed and anxious all the time. when i’m with one of my few friends i spend most of the time worried that i’ll say or do something to make them want to bail. i spend most of my time working and sleeping. 

I was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that’s taking a lot out of me. i’m grieving the loss of living a normal life while trying to adjust to being sick, tired and miserable all the time. 

i just feel like i’m on this hamster wheel, living the same day over and over. nothing to look forward to, no growth, hecka lonely, and wondering what the point is really. it’s so hard feeling sad and anxious and nothing all at the same time."

depression,2020/01/22,"SOS College Post Drink Depression i'm a sophomore in college (20F) who regularly goes out partying with my friends 2-3 days a week. I have a history of overdoing it and either blacking out/ doing something embarrassed which leaves me feeling really fucking ashamed with this horrible pit in my stomach when I wake up. I can't even close my eyes without feeling like the scum of humanity and feeling like a terrible person even though I go to a party school and I'm definitley not the only who blacks out sometimes. This feeling of shame has gotten so correlated with my drinking that even when I haven't blacked out in months or do anything embarrassing the night before I still wake up feeling this crippling shame and it's horrible. I know people are gonna say that if it feels this bad I should just stop drinking but that's not possible at the moment due to the social sphere I'm in at school and just the general binge drinking atmosphere my college has. Does anybody else get this, and if so does anybody have any advice on how to stop it?"
depression,2020/01/22,"Will Trazodone (50mg) for sleep cause weight gain? Hey everyone, I’ve (21F) have struggled with depression &amp; anxiety for many years. I have been on and off medications (SSRIs &amp; alprazolam/xanax) for three years now. I am currently off of them, having most recently been prescribed a low dosage of Zoloft. I didn’t notice at first, but the Zoloft caused me to be so tired during the day I had to take at least a two hour nap or I would not be able to function, my appetite increased immensely, and I gained 15 pounds. I recently got back to around the weight that I was at before being on the Zoloft and the only problem I have experienced is that I cannot sleep through the night. I have tried so many different natural remedies and I exercise nearly every day. I updated my doctor on my condition and she prescribed me 50mg of Trazodone to help with sleep. I’m not sure about it though because I just don’t want to gain the weight back because my weight increasing causes a lot of anxiety and depression factors, and mentally it’s better for me to be off of the medication without the weight gain. (I know I sound like I have an eating disorder but I do not, I eat a regular and healthy diet, I weight lift, and I worked very hard to lose 30 lbs once I graduated out of Highschool. I am 5’7 168lbs and I’m content with where I am at with my weight and just want to tone up and be fit.) 

Summary: I was prescribed this med by my dr to help w/ sleep, what were some side effects that you experienced while on this medication? I am afraid that I will gain back the weight that I worked really hard to lose, and that would in turn be very defeating. Has it helped you with sleep? Any other effects you noticed? 

Thank you in advance"

depression,2020/01/22,"Describe Depression in your own thoughts, feelings, emotions. My mom (55yrs) has been suffering with depression for a little over a year now. She goes in and out of it, and I would say about 2 weeks out of the month she has a hard time getting out of bed, doing daily tasks, etc. I (22F) have been one of her biggest supporters, I do my very very best to be there for her all the time and I’ve done endless hours of research on how to understand and help her through it, but I’m curious:

I feel like I can only gain so much understanding from reading mainstream science articles on depression, so I wanted to get some perspective from people that go through it on a daily basis. I want to understand it for her so I can help, I know everybody’s depression is different but I figure at this point anything can help. Also if anybody has any advice they would like to give, I would appreciate that as well. I love her dearly, and I never wish this type of pain on anybody. I can see how much it hurts just by the look on her face, but I also feel sometimes very in the dark about how she truly does feel. Thank you in advance everybody.

Side Note: she is on medication, and does see a therapist but is still struggling. 

Again thank you."
depression,2020/01/23,"Trying to psych myself up Hey guys, I (22F) am trying to psych myself up to make a doctors appointment after work.

depression,2020/01/23,"I feel like I ruined my life trying to save it. Just a little background I’m 25F and was diagnosed when I was 8 with depression. 

I had weight loss surgery a week ago today. The combination of not being able to eat, not wanting to fuck it up, and having been off my meds for a week really messed with me. I feel like I made the biggest mistake of my life by having this. And I felt it from the second I woke up, which I’m told is experienced by pretty much everyone who has the surgery. But on top of the normal “buyers remorse” of having surgery, I am fighting myself with eating. And the more I try to explain it, the less people understand. I am hungry. Not for steak or chicken nuggets, but just for literally anything. But every time I try to put food into my body, my brain spirals and creates a psychological effect of blocking off the hunger. So I take a sip, my brain tells me I’m full, but my stomach is still screaming in hunger.  This misery made me give up. So I’ve just been drinking water as I can. Which isn’t much. 

This lack of nutrients has my body extra exhausted, and my brain is too. I’ve thought of thousands of ways to die already. I’m not suicidal, but I don’t want to live anymore. I’m tired. And it just feels like my body is confirming that I fucked up and I did the wrong thing. 

On top of that, I work for my dad. But I’ve been so exhausted I can’t go back to work and he is mad. I know he’s not actually mad, but I feel the silent unavoidable anger he feels but doesn’t show.  It’s just all making me spiral hard."
depression,2020/01/24,"19M who has the voice of a 13F and it sucks. I’m okay, not suicidal or even hurt myself, but I just wanted to mostly see who has this same problem. Its just a really shit situation all together since I’ve been a kid. Always having that high pitches girl voice, even though I have been told by doctors and other friends I will grow out of it. It’s always been a problem online, with most people thinking I’m a “Egirl” and harassing me and some extreme cases of some of them thinking I’m a lady and hit on me(and unsolicited pictures). Ngl it’s nice to hear the compliments but I am a guy afterwards and I’m not transgender. I like my ladies, it just sucks that many people hear and think I am. It’s even come to a point a couple years ago I said fuck it and called myself “CrazyGrandma” and “YurTrannyGranny” cus why tf not. It’s been really bad lately with me being attacked, not respected and just all around nobody listening to me. If this is the bullshit you ladies out there experience online, I truly am sorry you have to suffer with it. It’s nice at-least I do have some lady friends online who know about it, but it’s just crazy how your voice can be such a judgement factor online."
depression,2020/01/24,"22F experiencing hair loss, can’t leave my bedroom I’m heartbroken. I’ve struggled with depression my whole life but the past few years I’ve made such incredible progress in beating it.... now I find that I’ve been losing my hair, and years of hard work have been undone all at once. 

It’s 4pm and I still haven’t left my bedroom, still haven’t eaten anything today or had a sip of water. The thought of leaving my bedroom makes me want to cry. 

I don’t want anyone to look at me, I don’t want to go out in public, I don’t want to encounter anyone and have to put on a brave face and a fake persona. I want to be invisible today because my hair is falling out and I feel ugly."
depression,2020/01/24,"My poem about depression Depression is:

Being tired all day but not sleeping at night 

My emotions being so low, and the next moment they take flight 

When something isn’t working and it feels like a personal attack
When something so small can set me so far back 
When there are days when my will to live is 
sick, withered, and black 

The guilt I feel for burdening people’s lives with the flaws of my personality 

Coping with it by laughing at it casually 

Not wanting to pick up phone calls, listen to voicemails, or answer texts 
Not wanting to do anything cause sometimes I just wished I were dead 

There. Even when my life is filled with laughter, love, and everything I could want. (I swear it has nothing to do with you, mom.) 

The guilt, again, because “What’s there to be depressed about? You have a good family and a warm house.” 

In my head, my heart, I feel it in my body.  

Killing me from the inside, I can feel myself rotting. 

The most beautiful minds are capable of the ugliest thoughts. 

Even if I lose this fight, aleast I could say I fought. 


Note: (25F) I had a really bad month in November. Almost admitted myself, it was the first time I had felt that way since in over a year. I felt balanced and content during the duration of my pregnancy and even after birth, but after returning to work when my baby turned 3 months old I slowly started to deteriorate and return to my pre-pregnancy state."
depression,2020/01/24,"I'm [23F], I really don't know how to change my shit life... Tl;dr, I have no work experience, have no idea if I can get a job with messy yellowish teeth and for being underweight. I have social anxiety and no friends because of isolation since 12 years old, low self-esteem, and mental disorders that haven't got diagnosed yet — because I'm too broke to even go to the clinic and get checked. Addicted to nicotine and caffeine. Again, I feel like something is seriously wrong with me — and whatever it is, it got worse and makes me freezes in sadness and makes me suicidal.

Full story, my parents marriage didn't work out, but they're still together despite great economy struggles. This is important because my parents clashed in their way raising their children; my father is strict and disciplined, but he's too busy working so we can eat. My mum on the other hand, only cooks and clean the house, she don't even care about the future and educations of her children.

Ever since leaving school because my father can't afford it in 2007, my brothers and I have been growing up as it is. We study only when we feel like it, sleep and woke up late. We manage to get education even though, me personally, are 5 years late.

I'm already in University where I can study at home, but it's damn difficult because I was not disciplined. I think I failed the first term, I start to rethink why I pick the business major when I have no interest in it, but I'm too anxious to tell my father that I want to change major because that means the money is wasted. I'm anxious for the test results that'll come out in February.

My breaking point is in December last year when it's the final exam. I have a break down and became suicidal, my mental state hasn't got any better. For a long time, I have been trying to be disciplined, starting over and over and over again but always failed. I have been writing a journal since 2016, and there's no major improvement at all — in fact I got worse ; I woke up at 1.30 p.m. today because I can't sleep until 6 a.m., I haven't done anything productive, just mindlessly watching YT videos and writing some shitty fan fiction. My father has long given up on me.

My father said his work partner, our only source of income for years, will close their business I think in the beginning of June. My brothers and I are in our 20s, none of us was ever employed or working. I'm pretty sure my brothers also have depression seeing their behaviour, so I can't really depend on them.

But I don't want this to continue. I planned to get my mental health checked this month, but my sadness pushes me to buy cigarettes instead. Though that's not the only problem. I'm too scared that once I do go, my father will questions me and will talk me back on not going to the therapist like back in December, and I'm just simply not ready to share my thoughts because we're not that close. Maybe he thought I'm just lacking discipline and simply lazy, I don't think that's the case.

I have done some research, I think I might have the inattentive type of ADHD and it has been the massive hinder in my life that always makes me fail. I'm interested in so many things, but I feel like I don't know how to start finding out or working on them. I used to think I liked to read, but I have pile of books I bought that I never read since years ago. But when I'm doing something, even studying, I'll forget to eat and study for hours — but it only happens once or twice a month. All the small responsibilities that seems easy always overwhelms me.

I'm not sure anymore just how much wrong is happen in my life and how much it drives me to insanity, because no normal person would fail for years at the simplest things like sleeping or waking up early, or even doing small things they're supposed to do like making their bed after waking up. It's so damn hard to just wake myself up, but I don't want to give up... I really want to go to the clinic even if I have to walk, even trying to motivate myself to live seems to be very hard..."

depression,2020/01/25,"Have any of you had success with alternative treatments? Help is appreciated :) After almost a decade of therapy and meds, I’m officially “treatment resistant.” I don’t think I can keep going with how I feel but I don’t want to give up. So I’m looking for alternative treatments to typical psych drugs. 

I (21F) have depression (dysthymia, cyclical depression), anxiety (GAD, panic), OCD (with dermatillomania), and PTSD. 

I’m currently on Pristiq and Abilify but they don’t work. 

Some things I’ve tried: 

1. Dozens of prescribed meds: Zoloft, Prozac, Xanax (got addicted), Cymbalta, Buspar, hydroxyzine, bupropion, Trintellix, Wellbutrin, etc.

2. Therapy: talk, exposure, acceptance, etc.

3. Supplements: NAC, l-theanine, caffeine, vitamin B, vitamin D

4. Illegal drugs: mescaline, LSD, LSA

5. Legal drugs: Siberian motherwort, dagga, CBD (not in a legal marijuana state), kava kava (tried today, helped but worried about liver + interactions with other meds)

I can’t afford ketamine therapy. I’d consider microdosing LSD but I don’t have access to it currently. Anyone got any other ideas? I’m kind of at the end of my rope here."
depression,2020/01/25,"Am I attacking myself with depression by thinking about my life? I am in a pretty rough patch right now. I’m a 20F and am currently a college student. I have been looking for a job for 7 months now, and I have applied to literally everywhere that would take my application in the area and I have followed up to almost every single one. I have only gotten two interviews, I got hired for one, but was laid off before I even started orientation. I am engaged and I’m planning a wedding that I’m barely going to be able to afford, because apparently trying to find a job as a millennial college student is absolutely useless. My fiancé has a full-time job, and is working so hard to keep us afloat, but even so, we still are struggling because even working full time barely covers living wages. (And believe me, we are living bare minimum too). I have other things going on, but for the sake of the question I’ll stop.

Anyway, when I think about these things I get these weird out of body experiences where I just look at myself in the mirror, or think about my life, and I can’t help but feel like everything is kinda trivial. I can’t help this, it just happens and it’s really hard to explain. I look in the mirror and I don’t see myself. I see a person that I barely recognize. I feel like I’m aimlessly drifting toward goals that I’ve always aspired to(college, marriage, a stable job), but when I think about them, in return I get all of these weird feelings and fall into a spontaneous depression. It’s starting to happen more frequently, but it usually only follows when I think about all of the stuff in my life right now. So am I attacking myself by thinking about these things that should be happy, even though I’m not feeling happy about them? Or is this something I can’t control? Also should I seek help or ride it out? I have never dealt with this sort of thing, so I have no idea how to handle it. Please help."

I have been depressed for almost 3 years now, cutted myself for over a year and had a lot of suicidal thoughts for over a year. And it finally starts to go away.

depression,2020/01/26,"I feel like I'm so behind in life and everything is pointless? Hi. Hope you're doing well.
24F here.

I have struggled with depression and anxiety for 8 years now and although sometimes it seems to get better I always relapse.

Right when I was about to start university, 5 years ago, my parents got a messy divorce and I had to move with my mom to a new city where I had no friends. It really took a toll on me and I lost my confidence. I was never super confident but I was capable of things. I had good grades, I was sure I was gonna have a decent future. 

It all changed though, and today I'm so insecure and self conscious about everything that I started to avoid situations just so I don't embarrass myself. 

It's been 5 years and I still don't have my degree. Actually, it was supposed to take 3 years and I have only passed about 1 year and a half of it in total. It's so fucking ridiculous. 

I'm European so studying isn't expensive compared to places like USA, but having a degree is considered prestigious everywhere in the world.

I just don't believe in myself and the more it takes for me to finish my degree the more anxious I feel because I'm so behind all my friends. I'm ashamed to admit I'm still studying when I'm with them, because I feel like an absolute failure.
I have no motivation to study, and I think that at this point, even if I did finish my degree in the next 2 years, I wouldn't even be proud of it because I would have taken like twice the time I was supposed to.

Please help me, I feel so bad. My dad says he's ashamed of me and has to lie to his friends bc their children have already finished their degrees.
I feel like I'll never finish mine, and I just lost another semester. I feel like it's useless to expect something different from the next semester because I'm always the same shit."
depression,2020/01/26,"I don’t want to have to live any longer 14F and i just can’t do it anymore. school is starting in 4 days and i can’t do another year of it, i really fucking can’t. I keep thinking about the future, about growing up, getting a job, working to live and i can’t ever see myself happy in that kind of situation. no matter what i do, where i go, how i live there will always be that routine to get up, eat food, make money, exist. i seems so goddamn unbearable.

nothing is interesting anymore, nothing excites me. i can’t live anymore, i can’t live in a world where i have to do something, i literally can’t fucking do it. i hate everyone, i don’t want to go back to school, to see familiar faces, everyone smiling, working, like they can do it, like they are excited to grow up, to start their life, to follow their dreams. i don’t have any fucking dreams anymore, i don’t know happiness or excitement, they seem so foreign to me. the last time i was excited was before i got high and drunk so i didn’t have to be stuck with all these fucking thoughts anymore, so i could just be numb and happy, i cried when i came down from that high because i went from giggling and smiling to the biggest fucking wave of depression i’ve ever felt. but now i realise i’m always at that level of depression, i just felt fucking happy for once and i didn’t want to let it go. 

none of this fucking makes any sense any more, my fingers are moving too fast for me to see if this is in actual fucking english or just a jumble of a numb and scared teenagers thoughts. i’m fucking sorry"
depression,2020/01/26,"I think she’s (19F) now free. Thought about this for a while, I was skeptical about posting it first but for the first time in a very long while I just want to speak and let some words out.
My girlfriend of three years broke up with me a few days ago, she said it’s best if we go our separate ways. 
I met her on one of these social media apps and someway somehow we started communicating a lot, normal conversation start became late night texts and.. you know how the story goes.
Honestly when I realized I was having feelings for I tried to get away and this is due to my pessimistic perspective way of seeing life.

I lost my mum when I was very young and my dad just a few years after. I don’t have to dictate what happened afterwards. Conventionally life becomes shztty. I had a rough childhood, physical and mental abuse was constant through it. I still carry scars on my body. 
I attempted suicide when I was 15,  someway somehow I survived the accident and afterwards I figured there are a lot of lives that I’ve touched at such a young age. The only thing that makes me happy is helping others, helping orphans get clothes with the little money I worked for or helping patients in need of financial help. 
“I’ll never attain happiness, not in this life.
People like me aren’t meant to be happy but I’m at peace knowing others might yet find happiness through me.” I told myself this till my mind, soul and body accepted it. A reason to live.

She’s this lively person and to put her personality in words I’ll say “electrifying”
She isn’t a calm before the storm, she’s the calm in the midst of the storm.
When I figured I was starting to have feelings for her I planned my death to just disappear before anyone gets hurt. I made a promise to myself to never let my heart get attached to someone. 
Lost my mum and my dad was the only hope I had left then he got sick too and I lost him. My sister was there for me to make sure I don’t see myself as an orphan. She tried her best from clothing to education. When I felt a little bit of hope, life took her from me. 
My very first girlfriend cheated on me with someone from her school.
Perhaps this might give you an idea of how shredded my emotions are.

Someway somehow my ex and I started a relationship, it was good. She was so kind and full of life, we had a lot of dreams. If only life is fair huh. As time passed I became dependent on her, I gave her way too much part of me that I’m starting to believe there could be a chance to be happy in this life, that she’s the one for me and honestly that’s bad because I don’t think I can afford the heartbreak. It’s pessimistic, I know.
I had some girls have dirty conversations with me on my socials and I gave her my details so she can see it and say I wasn’t faithful, at least that’ll make her break up with me. I didn’t want to be dependent on her. I prefer the cold side of life, it’s all I know. I didn’t want to take any chances.

It happened and she was rightly mad just as planned, I waited for the break up but it never came. She wanted us to work it out. 
I just came out clean to her that I just wanted to break up but she asked me to stay and I just let my feelings think for me. We were very much in love. Weeks after she told me about this incident of a guy kissing her during the whole time I was trying to break up with her. It hurt and it was like the pessimistic future was certain. I thought of it for a while and I told her it’s fine, we can work through it.

The few months were thee best I’ve come close ever since my parents, it’s like a new hope for life even though she doesn’t think I trust her enough and I wasn’t open to her as she was to me. Little arguments here and there but we worked through them. 
One of the stand out problems from my side is I don’t call often and that is due to the fact that I honestly do not like phone calls because of a phone call I couldn’t make.
Last time I spoke with my sister we had a verbal fight that I hate myself for till this minute. She wanted me to be patient with life and stop hanging out with some people because I was hacking people’s account, especially married men having affairs. I threatened to expose them to their family and I get paid in mobile credit to keep shut. 
She got sick few weeks later, the hospital was far and I didn’t have the means to make a single phone call to speak with her. The next news of her that came to me was her death, it shattered me. I couldn’t tell her she was right and I love her and she’s everything to me. I hated phone calls afterwards.

I know I kept switching between my past and my relationship but I think my past has almost everything to do with my present.

Our relationship was good, she celebrated her birthday few weeks ago. Here’s an excerpt from what I sent her. 
“The world is too noisy, life lost purpose and every picture is just blurry and when I try hard to see it from a different perspective.. it just is bleak. When my ship wrecked in the middle of an ocean and the only thing in sight was the storm about to mix with the huge tidal waves that’ll have me drowned you came on, you’re the hope that redefined life for me cos even amidst that storm you showed me the ocean can yet to sailed.”

It was a rocky relationship, we have our moments but it could’ve been better.
Major depression, trauma, anxiety and adhd were what I’m struggling with and sometimes I feel like she just doesn’t understand what it’s like to be me. 
I was tired of the little fights so I opened up to her about my condition and everything regarding my parents and I went back to therapy. She was very supportive. 
Among other issues I told my therapist I want to trust me girlfriend and I want her to know that I love her and trust her, I feel like she doesn’t believe I do. It was like everything is beginning to work till I asked for her password to change her display picture then I saw some messages she shared with someone and I wasn’t comfortable with it. She was too friendly, calling him names and all that. We had a fight regarding it and said hurtful things to each other.
It’s like the numerous ones we’ve had where we get back within hours cause we promised not to go to sleep being mad at each other but she later told me she needed space and I objected and later on agree. I woke up to her text saying it’s best if we go our separate ways and I shouldn’t try to convince her because her mind is made up.

She must’ve thought about it I guess, what hurts is knowing that decision wasn’t made overnight. She must’ve been thinking about it for a while. How long has she been thinking about it? Was I hurting her all that while? 
It was difficult and the only choice there is to give what she wants. I realized I might have been holding her back, I mean come on.
I’m an emotional wreck, depressed, anxiety, adhd, still in college and I’m honestly not the best in this love thing. I have my flaws. She’s now free.

She’s the best thing to happen to me, she gave me a new perspective towards life. Hope.
I had to learn to love her just to watch her go, 
I hope she finds the happiness she’s looking for wherever she may find herself.

Life is.. what it is."
depression,2020/01/26,"Lost my ex girlfriend (split 5 years ago) about half a year ago, cannot seem to 'get over it', and have never cried about it. Hi there, this is my first post here so I hope it's the right subreddit. I'm 17M, she was 17F.

September last year, a friend of mine who I've known my entire life died in her sleep, suddenly and totally unexpectedly. She had a reasonably good health, at least, people have lived well with worse health. When the news got to my family at 10PM, everyone was crying, everyone except for me. Me, the person who knew her at least 5 times better than my family ever did. Once, we had a 3 year long distance relationship stint. This ended when she came and visited me and at one stage without my consent, tried to give me a hand job. After that, we remained good friends. Excluding my family, I knew this person the longest out of everybody - lifelong friends, you might call it. Anyway, I didn't cry, and I figured it was shock. Well, it's been months, and the shock hasn't worn off. I've looked on the internet, and a lot of this seems to point to forms of depression. I normally can cry, so it's not as if I've had a longstanding issue. The closest I got to crying on the night we found out about her death was when I saw my mother. I was nearly crying tears for her, because I hate seeing my mum upset, but there was absolutely no feeling for the girl who had died. Since the death, I haven't cried, and I normally would cry, but I haven't. Is there a screw loose in my head? Please advise, or advise a subreddit if this isn't the right place.

TL;DR  
lifelong friend I have a complicated relationship with died unexpectedly and I have not cried, at all, ever since, so I'm worried it could be some kind of neurological development.

Thanks in advance"
depression,2020/01/27,"Direct copy and paste from my suicide watch post For context: I’m 18F, I have a 19F girlfriend, my biological mother 39, step dad 42, half sister 8, not step dad’s kid, and step siblings F22, M14, M11. 

I’ve made several attempts in the past, ever since I was 12. Telling my mom I was suicidal years ago was answered with “then go kill yourself, see if I care.”

My stress levels are at an all time high between college, threats of being kicked out, threats of rent, my relationship, my crazy step dad and sister, of being ghosted by potential employers, traveling, etc. I’m on Zoloft for anxiety and depression, lost my father at age 2, my half sister’s father tried to rape me on multiple accounts and my mother refused to call the cops on him bc of my sister. My step father, who came into my life around age 15, frequently calls me a monster and accuses me of trying to tear my family apart. My step sister constantly instigates fights and talks crap, then turns around and treats me like her best friend so she can use my art supplies and my car. 

I feel like my mother doesn’t want or love me and like the world will be a better place without me in it. The only people who would care are my gf, my little sister, and my M11 step sib, and these three people are the only reason i haven’t attempted these past years. Perhaps my one other friend, but no one else, really. I refuse to go back to therapy bc my mother will make my life hell again. 

I’m currently alone at Epcot on vacation with the family (they guilted me into going), after my mother told me to go away because I was ruining everyone’s appetite during lunch, after my step sis instigated another fight that only i got yelled at for. Calling my gf ended with lots of “You’re stronger than this,” and “you need to calm down” and “stop talking about what happened.” So I figured I’d post here for the first time."
depression,2020/01/27,"How do I (21F) keep from becoming more depressed after being used? I'm pretty depressed to begin with - obviously, since I'm here. I thought things were looking up for a little bit but now I'm back down. 

For the last week or so I've been reconnecting with a guy (21M) I went to high school with. He works at the bar I go to, so we started talking and hanging out. He asked for nudes pretty early on and I sent them. I wasn't really expecting it to happen, but I slept with him pretty early on, too. I told him I'm not looking for a relationship, but if he ever wants to hang out, smoke, get a drink, etc., I'm down. But of course he's still blowing me off and I'm being ghosted. I know I was used, he's a jackass, shit happens, blah blah blah. Normally I can just move on and forget it, but something is making me linger on this more. I'm just so tired of shit like this happening. In the past couple months, I've been used by at least a few different men and it's genuinely making me depressed. I'm okay when I first start talking to them and I tend to have a pretty good time. Something makes it turn to shit and I wallow for too long. What can I do to move past this faster? I do wanna talk to him about it but there never seems to be a decent enough time. 

TLDR: I was used by a guy, yet again, and it's just making me so sad. What can I do to feel better faster? 
I already try going to the gym to help with my depression, and I have mixed feelings about telling this to my therapist"
depression,2020/01/27,"Partner is depressed, stopped having sex My partner (26M) and I (28F) have been together for over 3 years, and have lived together for 2 years.

Our sex life was absolutely amazing (the best I've ever experienced!), but the frequency of sex has decreased dramatically over the last year and it's making me very disconnected and unwanted. Especially since this has happened before with my ex of 5 years (I ended due to the lack of sexual intimacy). I began to resent my ex because I was rejected so often (and other reasons). However, it's different with my current boyfriend because he is such a great person, I'm incredibly attracted to him and respect him very much. He has undeservingly been through a lot over the past couple of years. 

He suffered the loss of two very close family members late 2017 and early 2019, and has been dealing with some financial difficulties which has had a negative impact on his mental health. He has gained some weight as a result of comfort eating and working long hours. He also dislikes his job at the moment.

It all started a year ago, when I walked into the living room wearing just lingerie, stockings and heels, sat down, looked at him and started playing with myself. Usually this would send him wild, but he just looked awkward and stared at the TV. We spoke and he said he didn't feel in the mood, felt awkward, and that he just doesn't feel good about himself lately, like weight, etc. Still, he made the effort and we would probably have sex once a week.

Fast forward to December 2020. We hadn't had sex in 3 weeks, so I came onto him. But he didn't want it. We talked and he said he is depressed, overweight and hates his job. He said it had nothing to do with me, but his own issues. He said that he dreads having sex, and feels very stressed about initiating it, or when I initiate it. He just doesn't have a sex drive at the moment. He said that he wants to go to the doctors to see if he has a hormonal imbalance. I said that I would let him work through it with no pressure. 

Sex aside, we have a committed, loving and playful relationship. I am very happy with this man, and I genuinely want to be there for him through everything. Now it's been 2 months since we've done anything sexual, and I'm naturally feeling insecure, undesirable, disconnected. It's hard that I'm not able to talk about it. I also can't talk about it with a friend because I feel it's disrespectful. It hurts that I can't help him with his depression. And I wonder if our sex life can ever go back to the way it was (I miss it!). This is out of my control so I feel like Im just waiting and hoping for change. Please can you give me some hope or helpful advice.

Tldr; Partner has become depressed, haven't had sex in 2 months, feeling unwanted, missing the chemistry, I haven't experienced depression so I want to understand it to help our relationship"
depression,2020/01/29,"(20F) I'm embarrassed of my existence I have nothing to live for, nothing going for me. Anytime I try to do something to better my life I either ruin it myself or it just doesnt work out. My self-hatred and disgust has gotten to the point where I physically don't want to be seen by anyone. I moved back in with my family recently after I got hospitalized, lost my job, left a physically abusive relationship and got kicked out of school. I'm just a massive fuckup. I hide in my room constantly, pretending to be asleep whenever my family is home so I don't have to see the look of shame and pity on their faces. I don't take care of myself, I dont take any interest in my passions anymore, I spend all my time getting drunk or high just to take myself out of my mind. I am a waste of space. I'm completely alone. I can't bear to be around my family, I only have a couple of friends and none of them talk to me, I'm too embarrassed of my situation to open up to my boyfriend. I don't even want to kill myself because I'm afraid of failing like I've done in the past. I can't even kill myself correctly. I'm just exhausted. I'm so tired of existing. I am genuinely worthless."
depression,2020/01/29,How can I (22F) tell my parents I need to go see a therapist? In my last year of undergrad but I’m worried I’m losing my mind. I feel like I just can’t keep up with life anymore
depression,2020/01/29,"I feel so empty.. A year ago I (22 m) was engaged, had my own apartment with my fiancee (20F), felt like i was finally doing something right, and seeing as ive been diagnosed with depression since my first attempt at my life when I was 12, thats a very rare feeling in my life. 

After months of being single, homeless, and feeling more alone than i ever have since my ex left, i still feel trapped in my own hollowness.  I miss what i had in so many different aspects of my life that when i look around at my life now all i see is disappointment, missed accomplishments, and broken dreams. Im 80% sure i have PTSD from all the hardships (abuse, arrests,.. Too much) because I get these flashbacks that take me over completely sometimes and i feel like I'm just reliving every mistake I've ever made... And im to the point of where I dont even care to try and better myself anymore because everytime i try to it just gets blown back into my face or i regret it in some way or another. I don't have any family im close with i dont have any friends left, and ive honestly always hated myself for so many reasons... If it werent for my dog who has gone through the last two year's with me idda probably attempted my life again and with the way my thoughts have been im afraid for her sake somethings gonna make me snap and she won't even be enough to keep my thoughts straight. I remember being told i was destined for greatness, but thanks to these chains im still locked in the basement.."
depression,2020/01/29,"I finally figured out what I needed Yesterday I had a moment of clarity, I decided to start going to counseling. I briefly attended counseling in college, but I wasn’t receptive and my counselor refused to see me. She felt that while I was there on my own free will, I was not ready to commit to the methods required to progress. 

I (24F) live with my boyfriend (26M) and am genuinely happy with him. However, I have started to feel that there is an imbalance. I know that no relationship is truly 50/50 in every aspect, but there is more balance that what I have been experiencing. The stress of work and school have started to get to me, and I’ve been having more bad days than good. He isn’t there to support me. I could be crying or spiraling out in silence and he is too busy on his phone or too “tired” to notice. I have given all of myself but gotten nothing in return it seems. 

I need help, and I wish it was from him. I need someone to hear my screaming for help, but it isn’t him. I need to start counseling to try and fix the broken parts of me because at the end of the day that’s all I can rely on: myself. 

I know this may not belong here, but my depression is what made me feel this way and come to this conclusion. I love my boyfriend but right now I need to love myself more."
depression,2020/01/29,"25[M4F] I just want to write this to get this off my chest Hey.

First of all I just want to say that I'm truly sorry because I don't want anyone feeling bad for me. I have health, a nice family and friends and I don't have any rights to be sad, or at least that's the theory.

I'm tired of looking at myself at the mirror and thinking, ""God, dude you are fucking hot, you could get any girl in the world, you are just the king, start believing it"". But then time flies and I think the first time I thought that was when I was 16 years old or so, now look at me, all alone and without no one to just hug me and say "" Hey, don't worry dude (or love, or whatever), everything will be ok"".

It all started with a little bit of low self steem but now it's like everytime I see any man around me I compare myself to it and I always end up losing. It doesn't matter how that guy is, I always end up finding somethign that makes me think, "" I wish I could have that"".

As for today I'm still being a virgin, I get extremely nervous when I'm around girls and I don't see myself getting better any time soon. I'm really anxious when I'm in public, even with my family, if we are just having dinner in a nice restaurant, I always feel like I'm being ridiculous and being that one weirdo that gets every one attention for being a retard.

I can't feel relaxed when I'm not in my comfort zone, I started again my college degree (stopped studying 2 years ago), and I started being one of the best in class, now that exams are over I think that my best mark will be a sad 3 out of 10.

I feel stupid and in the wrong place all the time. When I get really nervous and anxious and something goes bad in my life I blame only myself for being a fucking retard and if the dissapointing is big enough I have to hurt myself or break something in order to try and calm myself, but only because I deserve that and more.

I just want to fucking stop existing, I don't have the guts to cut my veins because I hate knifes and blood, and also I'm still at least smart enough to think that that's the worst decision to make, but being a fucking failure it's killing me slowly and I don't know for how much I can handle it.

Lets at least wait until my parents are gone, they are a bit old so, maybe in a few years if this doesn't get any better we can start thinking about new solutions.

I'm sorry for what I'm about to say, I'll totally regret it tomorrow, but sometimes I feel that a doctor telling me that I have a terminal cancer will be the only thing that would make me feel relaxed for a little bit until the day I'm gone.

I'm a fucking crybaby, I know. I shouldn't have wrote that, just should have gone to bed and tomorrow will be another day. Like every fucking day. Best thing is that I spent more than 500 euro on a psycologist and I feel like I'm just throwing my fucking money.

I don't want to bore you anymore, sorry for that. Hope you guys have a nice day."
depression,2020/01/30,"I feel like a huge disappointment 
I (18F) pretty much failed last semester (college). I’m afraid to reach out to the people around me for help, and i disappoint the few people who I speak with. I was supposed to go out with friends today and I cancelled on them because I was feeling a weird mix of overwhelming numbness and sadness. The same thing happened with different people a couple days ago. My anxiety has become increasingly worse and I feel like I get no break. No one notices (or maybe they just don’t care) but I don’t expect them to. It’s not their job. They’re happy in their own lives and i would most likely only ruin the mood and bring them down anyway. The only relief I get is sleep, which is what I’ll probably do now. I feel so hopeless and alone in this."
depression,2020/01/30,"advice on talking to parent tw/ mention of suicide im a 17, almost 18F who lives with my mom. i have been depressed for about 5 years but most of it has been functional, but the last 7 months or so its gotten much worse, and the last 2 ive been having suicide ideation. i feel like i should tell my mom/therapist/general doctor but am hesitant for multiple reasons. 

backstory: in middle school i texted my mom from the school bathroom i wanted to kill myself. she picked me up from school and i will never forget how sad and devastated she looked. we decided to just start therapy instead of a mental hospital.

she always insisted i tell her when i feel this way again, but im scared it will trigger her active depression and i dont want to make her feel worse. she is also going through marriage troubles and real estate stuff and i dont want to add to the pressure. ive put off telling my therapist because im scared she would tell my mom since im a minor. 

ive always told myself/other that while i think of suicide, i dont think i could ever actually do it. my mom attempted in her 20s and always told me how devastated her parents were. but sometimes i feel like i could actually do it, if only i didnt have any family and no one to make sad. i take sleeping pills frequently because my thoughts get worse at night and i just want to pass out. 

should i tell my mom or try to work through with my therapist first? i dont see her (therapist) until 2/14 and im just so severely depressed right now and it feels forever. i dont know if i should submit myself to a hospital or not (which then triggers the question on how it would affect my schooling, im in community college, which starts in 2 weeks). sorry this is so ramble-y/personal. its my first time posting here and i dont know what the norm is. thanks to anyone who reads or replies to this. i hope you are doing better than i am &lt;3"
depression,2020/01/30,"How to find a career when you see yourself in a coffin in 5 years? I (20F/Europe) have been struggling with depression, anxiety and panic disorder for about 3 years now, it started about when I graduated high school.
Despite getting excellent grades I've been struggling with finding a career. The few passions I have left (entomology and film) aren't really an option as career in those fields seem really hard to get into.
I've been getting some internships lately and I struggle so much with the interviews. I have no passion left and all I want is to fall asleep and die, how am I supposed to answer questions like why I'm a good fit for the job or where I see myself in 5 years? ""I am a pathetic loser and will probably kill myself in the next couple years! :D"" won't do and the lies I end up telling aren't very convincing.
Any sort of minor stress leads to a panic attack, I've already been disowned by family members, it's questionable whether I will ever be able to drive a car. 
I'm on meds and attend therapy weekly, but I don't get the impression that it's helping much.
The more I keep failing and breaking down the harder it gets to get my life together, which leads to even more failure. I feel like such a failure, I'm not dumb and money wise I'm well off but I can't anything done. I hate myself.
Can anyone here offer advice on how to break the cycle? :(

depression,2020/01/31,"Haven’t really been myself as of late, am I showing signs of depression? For the past two months I’ve (26M) been feeling really out of place. I used to have a real great relationship with my girlfriend... everything I could of wanted but now all I want is to be on my own. On top of all this I’m going to sleep at 8pm, waking at 8am and snoozing until about 10 minutes before my shift starts. Not out of laziness but I feel like I’ve had 1 hour sleep max. 

Cause of this I’m not getting out to the gym like I used to, every single day.

I never want to go to social events and I feel like I’m just stuck in a place, job, family that I just want to escape from.  Just not sure what to do or who to tell. My GF (25F) said her ex had depression and she would finish this relationship if I ever had it. Although I feel like her ex may have just used “depression” as a means to be angry, where as I’m never angry. So that’s really thrown me... we live together by the way.

Just don’t really know what to do or what to feel right now.... it’s odd"

was wondering what your experience has been starting meds in the middle of a school semester?
did it impede on your ability to fully function school wise? in class/on assignments/during exams?

depression,2020/02/01,"I worry about gaining weight This is my (22F) longest and deepest depressive episode so far. I've struggled with depression and self harm as a teenager and I got help at the time. I sought help again after hurting myself and my therapist says I actually am clinically depressed and has made me an appointment with a psychiatrist who is more than likely going to prescribe me some medication. The thing is, my mother (bipolar and currently in a mental facility) has gotten me scared about getting fat. I know she doesn't intend to but she has issues with anorexia as part of the bpd and she immediately told me that anti depressants are probably going to make me gain a lot of weight. My sleeping schedule is fucked up because I either sleep too much or not enough and I am always hungry and have bad eating habits, so I will regurlaly eat sandwiches and what not in the middle of the night. I'm afraid of eating even more after being prescribed the meds but at the same time I know if I don't get help very soon I am going to end up harming myself again or worse.

But for the first time in my life (22F) I feel so alone and I don’t know how to deal with these feelings.

depression,2020/02/01,"No one told me you wouldn't know what to do after not dying. When I was 22 (Am now 28F, diagnosed with persistent depression, major depression, and general anxiety disorder) I attempted to commit suicide, but a friend intervened and so I'm still here. Before this I had been suicidal for, well, a very long time. I think my earliest thoughts were when I was 11 or 12, and then I started to plan around 16.  After this attempt I tried to be proactive with treatment. I got a therapist, got meds, and tried to do what I could to improve my life at least with those two things.

Now, years later I am still here. I think that's good, but I never planned for anything. I thought I'd be dead. I didn't think I'd ever see this age. I'm frustrated because I can't seem to establish goals, or dreams, or anything honestly that is something that resembles a step forward (Career, school, home ownership, etc).  I've been doing the day-by-day method for so long.  I don't know what I want, what I can do, or how I can do it. When I didn't die everyone was just so happy I was alive, so sure I'd just pick myself up and keep going, but I haven't.  I've been constantly lost. People never explained to me that you don't just come out from trying to take your life into a constant state of confusion, and endless insecurity about your actions. In fact I feel like a lot of people treated it like a simple bump in the road. Like I caught the flu, and now I'm over it. And I think I can say I'm trying, but I seem to keep hitting the ""I was supposed to be dead by now"" wall.  I don't know what else to call it.  Definitely no one explained the long term affects of being depressed and suicidal. How when you think you'll be gone for so long you just stop focusing on the future, and future planning becomes endlessly difficult.    

When I've attempted to explain this issue with others they do not understand. I generally get treated like I'm being dramatic, annoying, or just stupid.  Like I should just get over this overwhelming feeling of loss, and this inability to establish what will make me happy in life. So I'm at a loss. I'm feeling frustrated. I know my depression, and anxiety isn't going anywhere, but I figured I'd be able to find the path again. I haven't. I'm sad I haven't. No one seems to get this feeling I'm trying to explain. 

I'm not gonna say it was at all a smooth 6 years either. I've gone through more meds than I could ever had imagined existing, and I'm not on any right now. I have a therapist, and she's fine, though I don't feel I click. I was hospitalized 2 years ago, because I was pretty much ready to try again, and I didn't want that. I'm afraid I'm building this feeling up again.  

I'm sorry for this cluster of nonsense. I hope I make some sense. I've never posted on this in an online community ever, or really tried to explain this in a way that strangers could understand beyond my therapist. I only think she half understands me most days too, so I imagine this is tough to read."

I am currently 7 months with baby #3, a girl.  I didn't necessarily enjoy being pregnant with any of my children but I have just been down right not myself with pregnancy #3.  I have pulled away from family, friends, and people at work, I have lost interest in just about everything.  I sleep all the time (although that could be pregnant exhaution).  I am also a very neat, picky, and clean person and I just cannot find the urge to keep the house kept.  I have tried my hardest to get out of this slump.  I have talked to my mom, husband, and confided in a close coworker about my feelings just so they know what is going on.  Although the people that see me everyday have already asked if I was alright.

I have also felt very insecure.  Insecure as a parent, a worker, a spouse. It's been building and getting worse.  I don't like it and I dont know how to stop it.  I haven't felt good (morning sickness, tired, swollen, unattractive) and then the not feeling good started messing with me mentally. My mind has really went to some wierd and dark places but im pretty sure most of it is literally all made up stuff in my mind.  No merit to any of it.  Just insecurities brought on by not feeling well and trying to just push through.  I feel like I'm typically a pretty confident, bubbly, and playful person but I havent been lately.  I'm trying to brighten my mood by doing stuff I like ... started with cooking different and new foods for my family.  My friend bought me a seasonal depression light.  I bought some toys for me an hubby to try with ""alone time"" and it has helped a little and I noticed my spark coming back.  

Then tonight, the light started to dim again.  My husband made a silly comment about checking out other women, he has been out of town for a week (last night was his first night back) and again, I am confident, not a jealous person, and I also will check out women with him but I took it personal this time.  I didn't say anything but it stung a little, especially considering I'm feeling a bit like a whale these days.  My self worth is distorted and I'm doing my best to not let my inaccurate ideals and insecurities seep into the real world but they are.  I just want to be bubbly playful me again.  I'm starting to feel like maybe I cant do this all by myself.

My current meds aren't working and make me have night swears every night, but I have to wait until March to get in as a new patient to see anyone in my area. I've spent almost every day the last 3 weeks thinking about how it'd be so much better if I were dead and/or killing myself. 

My depression has been at a point lately where I just cannot find the motivation to do anything, including hobbies and work. I've always struggled with employment because of my depression, and am unemployed ATM. 

* Unemployed
* Childless
* Almost 30
* Single... again... (Apparently will be forever)
* Poor
* Low functioning because of MDD

The only reasons I'm still here are one, I'm scared to kill myself and two, I can't stand the idea of what my family and friends would go through.

But it's like, why? I'm certainly not here for myself. So I have no idea what to do now as I spiral further into depression and can't seem to get medical help.

Also, the wonderful PNW USA, I can't afford to anything medical, but the free medical I'm on through my state is apparently very limited. IDK I just needed to rant and maybe hear things from different POVs......"
depression,2020/02/01,"I don’t feel real. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 12 years old. I’m 19F now and I’m just so unhappy... I don’t feel like a real person. Everything just seems so pointless to me. Nothing actually makes me happy and I try to make myself happy but nothing works. Truthfully the only reason I haven’t completely given up is because I have a full time job and when I’m working, I don’t have time to get in my head and feel this way. I only feel like this when I have a day off. I lay around in my bed and don’t exist. My room becomes a disgusting mess and so do I. I don’t feel anything and everything sucks. I don’t go to school, I don’t drive. I just cycle through everyday, nothing excites me and nothing feels good. I talk to guys in hopes they will bring me that sense of happiness and wholeness but that doesn’t help either. I just don’t know what to do anymore.. I feel no hope for myself at all. I want to feel like I actually exist."
depression,2020/02/02,"HELPPP My (23M) girlfriend (22F) suffers with severe depression, she's on medications, lately she's been acting a bit distant to me, when she's feeling low she doesn't want to meet up. Short replies, not interested in anything, doesn't want to hurt me and I don't want to hurt her. She tells me when she feels bad but tells me she feels blank and doesn't want to leave house to meet up with me. She trusts me and I trust her but I want to do something to help her. I asked if there's anything she wants and she doesn't want anything, we took a break from ourselves but I'm not sure if that's a good idea now that I think about it... Im not sure if I should be there for her, and text or call even if she doesn't feel like meeting up. It hurts me like hell when I can't even text her or check up on her. Any advice is greatly appreciated."
depression,2020/02/02,"Depression is a work of the devil. Well, what can you say about that?

I \[17F\] finally told my dad about being *depressed*, and this is the response I got. I honestly do not know how to feel about it.

For context:

This morning, I got scolded for waking up late, for we had to go to church; yes, I grew up with a religious background. Well, this isn't the first time though. I admit that I've been like this for *so* many times.

When we got home, my dad confronted me about it and asked, ""What's the problem with you?""

I did not say a thing. I could not tell him that I don't see the need to go out of the house just to see fault-finders who criticize others before criticizing themselves. I did not answer for I was afraid that he would disclose the topic to my Nmom who would probably see *it* as a joke to make fun of.

My dad told me that we *need* to talk. He said that I *should* open up to him and that he knows there must be a problem due to my attitude at home. He asked me if it was about the pressure my school has been putting on me. He asked a ton of things afterwards which I can't remember anymore.

So, I finally (after a considerably long time) confided my thoughts to him - that I might be actually *depressed* and that my anxiety is taking the better of me.

He then told me that depression is a ""work of the devil."" He advised that I *should not be depressed* and focus more on the positive side. And for that reason, I had to attend every. church. activity. there is.

I mean, I have no right to say that he was wrong, yet I don't agree with him either. I also understand that he is trying his best to reach out to me, but boy, that advice is surely hard to follow.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I told my dad I might be depressed. He told me that depression is a work of the devil.

Note: I love my dad so much. He even assured me that he could listen to everything that I have to say. I'm just a little unsure about that, considering he, too, has his egoistic side.

I also have absolutely no grudge against my mom despite her being a narc. Though, I sometimes feel frustrated that I am being deprived of some of my needs."
depression,2020/02/02,"Recovery Hi (19F), I was diagnosed with depression a little over a year ago. I wasn’t able to get out of bed before 3pm, I felt like nothing was worth my time. I am a university student, and I fell completely out of line with my studies. Fast forward a year, I switched degrees and found out what I’m really passionate about (psychology ahah) and school means so much more to me and I’m excited about my future and my grades have gone up two letter grades. I am finally able to wake up before 9am and be happy to start my day, (my anxiety still makes it hard to go to class) but I am finally happy to wake up in the morning which is such an accomplishment to me. During the day if I feel tired I avoid the nap and drink some coffee, I don’t want to sleep away my life anymore. I have this complete sense of wholeness and I never want to go back to the state I was in just less than a year ago. I was on antidepressants for a bit but I went off them along with my birth control. I think my birth control may have been the reason of my sadness, I’m not sure though. I am still trying to get into counselling to help with my recovery and to make sure I continue to grow. Overall, i have finally told my friends that I am happy, they haven’t heard that in a long time and even when I go to tell them how happy I am I have to hold back my tears/emotions because it’s so weird to talk about happiness especially when it comes to myself. I never thought I would make it here again but I am happy I did it. I went through a lot of my depression alone so I don’t think anyone understands how much it means to me when I say “I feel happy”. But I don’t really care, I know how much it means to genuinely say I am happy, because I know what I have been through and I know what the deepest darkest parts of depression brings. I really just wanted to share my happy feelings and the fact that I think I might be okay again and I can not explain how big this is. It does get better, and even if it takes longer than the year and a half it took me, it does get better."
depression,2020/02/03,"I’m in a heartbreaking situation This will be quite long so hold your horses guys :)

Me (19M) and my Nepali GF (18F) have been together for three months as College Freshmen. She’s better than I thought. With the Spring term arriving, I’m financially unable to attend my current four-year institution . So, I have to transfer to a community college that’s 3 hrs away near my hometown. I’m able to return in the Fall, though. She and her friends are going back home to Nepal for the summer &amp; they’ll be back in the U.S around August. I plan on returning to my current four year by that time, but not specifically for these reasons only. School wise, my career pathway is going great. However, my concern is that my GF will have another guy in her life once I return. What if she friend zones me when I come back? Obviously, Idk what her love life will be like &amp; I know I sound like a controlling &amp; paranoid BF, but I’m wondering if I should move on to another girl &amp; hope we can be back together once I return. 

7 months is so fucking long, I don’t want to lose what I have because my happiness has never been this high before. I don’t want to live in the past, that’s why I moved far away to college. Being with a girl who will wake up early in the morning to drive through a blizzard just to buy you cough medicine is something I truly cherish because I’ve never met one who’d do that. I asked her why she did it, she says “I care about you more than you care about your health.” Was I in a dream? There’s actually someone who loves me like this? 

This is so rare that I don’t want to leave her. Once I broke the news to her, she starting bawling her eyes like a faucet telling me that “She won’t ever find a guy like me again.” And I’ll never find a girl as good as her. I don’t know it now, but my depression is going to hit me like a bus within a week. I feel like my identity &amp; life have truly been revoked. To be honest, I’ve never felt such a genuine connection with any girl in my life. Last night I was with her and we partied our asses off. We got hammered and it was just her and I on the dance floor. The whole bar (of 70 people) we’re watching us dance like AARP members. She looked me in the eyes and drunkly said, “Any girl would be lucky to have you babe. Don’t fucking forget me okay? I don’t want you to leave because I still really love you.” Then she started crying again. I cant believe I have to leave the very people who care for me the most. Life’s too good for this to change. I can really be myself for once.....finally. I had just gotten to know her other Nepali friends. We’d go partying and cook dinner together. They enjoy my company &amp; treat me like family. Being around people who actually give a shit about you is something that I hardly experienced. In the past, I always had to act a certain way to make friends, but these people make me feel human for once. 

I make them laugh &amp; they pull a few pranks on me too.  For once in my life, I have finally reached a state of happiness that has been gone for so unbelievably long. Seeing her smile when I wake up in the morning gives me reason to enjoy life again. I don’t want to drive away from my new life. I love my school, campus pride, and friends. I don’t want to be a forgotten memory to them. Being with her and spending time with her friends makes me feel alive. Now, I have to leave it all behind without getting to truly bond and make more memories with them. In H.S I was basically alone. Now, my faith in God is fucking gone. I just want to be happy for once, cut me a fucking break and stop torturing me. This is too much for me. 

What are your thoughts? :)"
depression,2020/02/03,"22F Sick and tired, can’t take it anymore, year away from graduating (bad english sorry is not my first lenguaje) Im from a small town (22 F) but i went 8 months to a big city and i loved it, i don’t have friends here in my hometown but there i had a blast and i love to go out dancing and here theres not much places to go and the music sucks.
Im extemely sad, i had a bf there and i lived with him several months , and went back to that city in winter vacations and on my birthday, my relationship was very complicated and thats not the reason why im sad in here, its because i really cant take it anymore
The reason i have to stay here is because im supposed to finish college the next december (2021) but fuck its a lot
I cry almost everyday i feel like shit , i met a guy and it was awful ( i broke up with my bf ) and then met another guy and i was kinda happy but this weekend my only girlfriend went out of town because its a long weekend ( dont have classes this monday) and the actual guy im dating i know he likes me a lot and he kinda loves me ( hes really nice and a total gentleman) but he works a fucking lot , his parents have a lot of restaurants but they treat him poorly i mean they are always giving him orders and even he tells me that hes sick n tired of them giving them chores all the time because his dad doesnt do shit.
So this weekend we didnt go out fucking thursday and on friday he canceled me like minutes before going out because his dad told him to go check on some pipe water problem idk., so he took a plumber etc, and on saturday he had this event on the restaurant and i was like omfg are we really not hanging out this fucking ENTIRE WEEKEND WTF and i was super mad because he dont understand, now its fucking sunday and idk if im going out with him or not. 
The major problem here is that if he had told me before we couldnt go out this weeknd, i would have make plans to go to another city thats 3hrs away from here and theres more cool shit to do and i have some friends there.
But instead im here being depressed all days not going out and doing literally NOTHING, because my only friend is not here and i cant go out with guy friends because i know they like me in a way so i would feel bad for this other guy and also the city is so small he would get mad or something idk, boys r crazy.
And alsooooo i got my period on friday so im 1000000 times more depressed and sad .
Im tired with life in general and dont know what to do. I dont even see the point of going to school anymore, im really having a hard time here , and i have had this feeling long time ago but now i feel like its a lot and i cant take it anymore i need to get out of here or else idk what am i gonna do im so so so sad , next level sad , not writing this for you to feel bad for me but literally in tears rn. 
Im so sad im very confused because if he asks me to go out and i go with him i know im going to be pissed off with him cause we didnt go out for like 3 days ( im saying this because we normally go out almost every day, literally)
Idk what to do any advice is good
Also i wanna do some hobbies like yoga or dancing but my school schedule sucks and i cant do anything im going to spinning class ( it really cool) but just 2-3 days a week and i hang out with this guy but omg im suffering , idk if i should go to therapy because i dont want my family to know im depressed they are very old school and i feel they would treat me differently or feel bad idk. Maybe i will but idk. 

TL;DR 22F one year  away from graduating so have to stay in her shitty hometown all this time but im DONE with this city , have no friends , no place to go dancing because music sucks here. Sad big time , mad at my actual guy because we didnt go out this weekend"
depression,2020/02/04,"First Appointment Not sure if this is the right subreddit - if it isn't feel free to take down.

&amp;#x200B;

I (20F) have made my first doctors appointment for depression which happens next week. I've taken the steps after having it for years due to various forms of abuse my mother inflicted on me, among other things. I'm really nervous, and don't know what to expect or what to prepare beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a support system in place, or anyone to ask irl. I've just realised I really need help as its ruining my life.  I'd appreciate any advice or ideas anyone can suggest. Thanks for your time."
depression,2020/02/04,"Considering murdering someone to avoid homelessness. Hey all, 23M and stuck in a hole I'm afraid i'll never climb out of. I still live at home with my mother, whose health is deteriorating rapidly as she had me very late - in her 40s. She'll probably have to be put in a home soon, which means I'm likely to end up homeless in the next few years, and there is nowhere for me to stay (I'm an only child, grandparents are dead and I've got 0 friends. 10 year wait for city housing!)

The problem is that I got no income coming in (was denied welfare and disability) and neither does my moms, as she uses it to pay all the bills. I can't get a job as I dropped out of high school from depression, and even then I wouldn't be able to hold down an interview anyway, thanks to my severe anxiety. I don't even have a drivers license. I rarely go outside, and when I do its only when I'm going shopping with moms. I can't leave the house alone due to my debilitating anxiety, and I've no money to get help.

You see, I've strongly considered stabbing someone to death just so I can go to prison and not worry about sleeping on the streets in -40F weather. In prison I'll be able to socialize with like-minded people and even get an education. There's nothing for me in the real world-nothing."
depression,2020/02/05,yo does anyone wanna talk i’ll listen or u can listen i’m 16F we can just talk ik a lot of people on here probably just wanna talk
depression,2020/02/05,Can’t get out of bed I’ve struggled with depression for more than half my life now (30F) but the past few years have gotten worse and worse. I work in a field with high burn out rates and recently I find myself not being able to get out of bed. Fortunately I have a position where I can be flexible with setting my hours but it’s getting to the point where I can’t get to work at all. The spiral is real. I know if I keep going like this I will get fired which makes me burrow further into bed. I feel trapped at work because I am paying back a school loan. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up before I lose my mind completely.
depression,2020/02/05,"I want to kill myself but I can’t bring myself to do it Hi, I’m a 21F from Saudi living in the UK for university. I’ve always had to deal with anxiety, constant panic attacks, low self esteem issues, depression etc my entire life. 
I never really fully experienced life like normal people do (e.g. going out with friends, dating) because of how strict my family is. I’ve never really had friends back in school either, I was just always that “extra person” in my friend’s group. All I’d do is carry their stuff, buy things for them with my money because I was bullied into doing that.
I had to beg and cry to my family for 3 years to let me come to the UK to study and they did but on one condition: I’d call them everyday at least 2-3 times in a day, if I don’t, my parents threaten to call me back home. They talk about me getting married as soon as I graduate almost everyday, emotionally blackmailing me into it. I’m not religious, I’ve left religion a long time ago, if they find out I’m not muslim anymore they will definitely disown me or worse, kill me. 
I’ve never really had good experiences with men either here in the UK. I was r*ped when I first came here. Most of the guys I like just lead me on, have sex with me, and leave. This last guy I was really interested in, he lead me on so much, had sex with me, and started ignoring me, when I asked him why he isn’t responding to my texts he said he doesn’t feel comfortable around me because I agree with him too much and he wants someone who has different opinions than him, someone who’s lively. This hurt my self esteem a lot, I have no idea why every little thing hurts me so much. 
I have good friends now in uni but a couple of them are a little too judgmental, I’ve been made fun of how skinny I am too as if I’m not aware of that. I fucking hate the way I look. And when I used to talk to some of them about how I feel, they tell me they’ve had it worse or that I should be grateful because other people out there have it 10x worse. I completely stopped sharing my feelings with those particular people though. I have only 2 best friends who actually listen to me but i dont wanna be a burden on them and worry them too much by telling them I’m suicidal.
I started going to therapy in uni and it does help but i just feel hopeless and exhausted again today..
I’m really tired at this point. I want to end things but I can’t bring myself to, I don’t have the power to do so right now. If I could, I would definitely like to end it all and rid myself of this pain."
depression,2020/02/05,"I have a toxic situation waiting for me back home... what do I do ? I (22F) live in a foreign country in Europe since 2017. I came to the country to study for 3 years so by October 2020 I have to leave the country unless my situation change.

I was happy to leave my country since my family is very toxic : my mother hate my father, my father loves my mother 10% of the time and my brother (19M) blames me for his failure in life (he thinks that I used all the money that my parents had to go to university witch is not true at all) and though he beats my father and my mother on a daily basis.

The abuse from my brother started when he was a teenager, he would beat my father and mother for simple things like telling him to do his homework.

He attempted suicide many times and wanted to kill me and my family many times (he wanted to disfigure me with a knife and wanted to kill my parents because they failed him)

According to him, they love me more so they spent everything they have for my education and they forgot about him. The truth of the matter is that he
 never wanted to study since a young age and with my parents forcing him to study he became very violent and thus did not propose to him extra classes like they did to me because he was not attending the normal mandatory ones and my family didn't have money to throw.

The problem is that I finished my studies and I will be obligated to go back hom on October of this year and it gives nightmares to think that I will be under the same roof as him.

Moving out of he is not an option since my home country is a muslim country and girls are not allowed to live alone and no I can't bring my parents to live with me if I purchase an apartment because they don't want to leave the house to my brother.

I just feel like wanting to attempt suicide everytime that I think about what's waiting for me back home.

I don't know what I should do..."

depression,2020/02/05,"What is the most self-destructive thing you have done due to your depression, in terms of a romantic relationship? I (38M) have no experience with depression myself, but I dated someone (36F) who suffered her whole life. Together 8 years, engaged, 95% of the time she was a great partner. On our 8th anniversary, she said she needed space, then slept with our mutual friend a few days later. Objectively speaking, our friend was gross, so all of our other friends suggested she did it because she knew it was something she ""couldn't take back.""

My brain is very logical and evidence based. Has anyone here done something similar due to their depression? Did you ever try to fix it? This happened to me 3 years ago. I fought for her for a while after it happened, but she never responded and has never reached out to me. She also has incredible pride, which I hear is common among those with depression, so I think it was a combination of those two things.

I am not asking for your experiences as a way of giving me hope, I have none of that, lol. Just emotionally and intellectually curious so that MAYBE I can understand and empathize a little better."
depression,2020/02/06,"Rant I have no one to tell this to so here I go.
I'm 20F I don't have any friends because I cut of contact with people feeling that I annoy them and they hate me.
I've been diagnosed with depression a couple of years back but haven't really done anything about it(went to a psychologist a couple a times tho,didn't change anything).
I also tried to OD a couple of times (+-6) with 2 attempts ending at the ER. My parents dont know about these attempts, I did tell them I was depressed but they didn't think much of it, and said stuff to make me feel worse than I already did. 
It's my first year in college and study Informatics (programming and stuff) but I don't have the will power to study and make sure I pass my classes. 
I wanna pass them so that I'm not a bigger disappointment than I already am. But I never expected to make it this far I don't really know what to do. I don't really have any emotions left except for guilt, sadness and anger at the world (most of the time I'm numb tho).
I just wanna die in peace without having to do it myself cause it would destroy my parents if I killed my self , that's why I wanna get really sick or have a little accident.
And i feel guilty that I'm wishing for this when there are people who are fighting cancer(my dad) and doing everything to survive.
Even though I know people have it waaat worse than me and my life isn't bad at all compared to others, I just don't see the point in living I don't have anything that sparks joy in my life. And the mistakes I made last year add to the fact that I hate my self and am a piece of garbage.
I'm sorry for the long monotonous text I just had to tell someone.
And sorry for my bad English."
depression,2020/02/06,"I feel lost i really don't know what to do right now, can someone help?  

My (19F) girlfriend broke up with me (20M) about a week ago and I have lost all motivation to do anything, fell behind in school work, and keep having panic attacks and no one to talk to.

Sorry if this is worded poorly I am currently freaking out as I type this. So we were together for 2 years and have broken up in the past for similar reasons only for a little more than a week I think, I honestly don't remember. She basically says that I smother her and am too needy. She is away at college about 2 hours away from me. I know I was insecure and I would call her all the time and if she was busy I would feel like she just didn't want to talk to me so I would get insecure about that and if she went out I would ask too many questions about who is going and what not. She didn't think I trusted her, I don't think that is how I felt, I think I just love her too much and was scared to lose her. I went to therapy and it made me realize why I did all those things and that it was a deep issue that came from my childhood.

She still loves me, she keeps telling me that, and she said she is open to getting back together in the future. Although she also says she wants to fully let me go to work on her self because she has a lot of stressful things going on in her life. She has problems with her health, mental and physical, and she is seeking help for these things and I feel so bad that I wasn't there for her the way I feel I could have been. She had anger problems that would start petty arguments a lot and was probably triggered by my insecurities. But deep down to my core I love this girl with all my fucking heart and soul. I can't understand if she still loves me how she can just leave me like this. She said we can talk over coffee when she gets back for spring break in about a month but I don't know what to do. I feel as though now I realize how depressed I was. I have no motivation for anything right now, all I have been doing is hanging out with friends because I am scared to be by myself. I just want to be happy and I am scared that I dont have the motivation to do something about it right now. Everytime I have a panic attack I want to call her but I know that will just push her away even more. I want her back more than anything in the world but I am confused on how possible that is, I don't want to move on before I even get the chance to talk to her in person and see how we stand then. But the pain of waiting for that is unbearable. I have to wait almost a week to see my therapist again. My friends are in relationships so they can only do so much. And my other friends are at college or online where I play games with them. I feel like I just can't enjoy being by myself. I am so scared. And I am in so much pain right now. It feels like there is a pressure in my chest constantly. Any advice or thoughts are much appreciated."
depression,2020/02/07,"Suicidal thoughts and relationships Around 8 years or so ago, I \[26M at the time\] entered into a pretty serious period of depression (physical health related, mostly). Roughly three years after that, I attempted suicide multiple times. I'm talking serious, planned and thoroughly researched methods.

I was with a long-term partner for most of that time \[25F\], although the attempts themselves only came after we'd split it. It wasn't the breakup that tipped me over the edge. Rather, the breakup was the opportunity I'd been waiting for -- taking my own life while in a relationship seems to me to be a cruel thing to do.

As it turned out, I can now see that the relationship dysfunctional, depression aside, and I can't believe it took us 5 years to work that out. But the whole experience has totally changed me.

I'm far from that mindset now. Yet I'm very rarely grateful to be still alive I can think of no particularly good reason to go on living, as I find much of life a chore. This is despite the fact that objectively all is good and well: I eat well, have plenty of friends and hobbies, live communally with 8 wonderful people, and have a relatively comfortable academic research job (in well-being and sustainability, ironically). I'm currently on holiday for 6 weeks running up mountains ffs.

So here is my dilemma. Having been so close to taking my own life, and knowing that I'm still quite indifferent about my future, I think there's a significant chance that I will end up seriously trying to end my life again in the future. And so I've pretty much closed myself off to romance (and am perhaps a little guarded more broadly), despite craving intimacy deeply, because it seems unfair to bring anyone else into that situation. And that sucks for me, too.

Honestly, I don't know how this will change. How could I *ever* be sure that I won't end up that seriously suicidal again? And if that's true, how can I ever commit to someone as fully as they would like? Yet closing myself off this way means I'm missing out on some of life's more meaningful experiences, which of course leaves me more likely to sink very deeply into depression again.

It seems an insolvable dilemma, unless, of course, a find someone with almost the same history and outlook as me, such that we understood each other well enough to let whatever happens happen, without shouldering the blame.

Can anyone else relate? (I'm afraid I can't think of a more specific question...)

TL;DR:

For people that have seriously attempted suicide before, can you be totally sure you won't go to that place again? And if not, how can you fully commit to relationships, particularly of the romantic kind?"
depression,2020/02/08,"I don't know what happiness feels like anymore I (21F) recently got a job on campus after struggling in the process of campus placements for about 4 months of writing tests and getting rejected in interviews.

And right now all I feel is like a weight has been lifted off me and that's about it.
Every thing feels anticlimactic at this point to be honest.
I should be happy right? Why the fuck am I not happy?"
depression,2020/02/08,"Maybe I need to talk to someone Hey everyone I do not know if this is the right place to post this or if I even should. My family has never been one for talking about ones emotions so I have been confused half my life on what I am feeling. I think i just need some reassurence or help.

I am 27F and for as long as I can remember I have never really been motivated about anything. My house is dirty, I am embarrased to have people over. I try to motivate myself to clean it but before I can finish one room I quit and just go do whatever. When I do complete a room it then just gets back to the way it was in less than a week.

Most time I get excited to go to the store or buy something new but before I leave I some how talk myself out of it and stay home. It's like I have no energy but I'm not tired if that makes sense.

I also tend to just cry over things that make no sense. Example last night I asked my father if I could have the tv for 30min to play a game since he had been home all day it seemed to be right to me. Instead he said no that i have a tv in my room, and i just went to my room and cried.

I've been told when I have a conversation I show little to no emotion and that I'm a boring person to talk to, people even said this in high school. I've figured out how to fake it now so my current few friends dont know. I constantly lie to make my life seem better than it is, I lie about stuff I do *I really dont do anything* or where I go.

My family says I am just lazy and a huge procrastinator, but I've had the few who said I could be depressed. I dont know what I am, lazy or depressed I just know I never look happy and I feel boring and melancholy all the time. 

I'm not looking for a shoulder to cry on I just want to know if this is normal or not. I can work on lazy but I'll need a therapist to help if I'm depressed."
depression,2020/02/09,"Please advise on an Escitalopram side effect: ITCHING! Hi all! Im 26F from the Philippines, for context. Im diagnosed with ADHD and MDD. I started taking Jovia (Esitalopram) for my MDD last November, and my dosage was upped to 15mg last December. This made me feeling sedated and sleepy all the time. I had weird vivid dreams before getting diagnosed, but it was 10x more real with Jovia. So my Dr asked me to try Esitalo or Morcet. I tried Esitalo with the same effect. I switched to Morcet last week, and my energy level improved. HOWEVER, I started itching on my ears. Then the scalp, and today my face and neck have started to itch.

Any advice? I just texted my Dr about this but I'd like to hear your thoughts. I've also been taking Ritalin for my ADHD since October, and biotin supplement (since December) because Ive been shedding so much hair from the Ritalin. Please help me!! Thanks!!"
depression,2020/02/09,"in love with my enemy? it makes me so depressed i swear to god hey uh i’m (13F) and i’ve had depression since 2018 now. it all started when i had a long distance relationship with a guy from south wales. soon later my mum found out and banned me from my phone for about a few months.
school is the main reason for everything; you know, the boring homework, relationships, friendships, all that shitty stuff. 
there’s this girl, who hangs out with us at school. nobody in my friend group likes her. we pretend to, though, to not hurt her feelings. she is nice and all but she has nothing in common with us and her personality and humour is way different to ours. but her existence. the way i’m falling in love with her. what the hell? why am i feeling this way about someone i hate so much? i hate her! she makes me depressed! so why am i in love with her? i just have no clue. it’s probably the way she just touches me and hugs me and reassures me like everything’s gonna be fine. and when she talks to my best friend, god i feel jealous. i have no clue why. my best friend hates her the most. but although my best friend hates her, she still talks to my enemy like nothing ever happened and they’re still the best of friends. why am i so selfish? wanting everyone to myself? i know, i know it’s not possible. but i’m in love. it stresses me out. it hurts me. i’m hurting.

and since i’m the most confident in the group i always tell people to shut up (because my friends want them to as well) and then i’m the bad guy? like what? i’m just saying what everyone else is thinking. and when i say something that offends my enemy, she gets upset and i feel the worst pain ever.
and the thing is, when my best friend isn’t in school i’m so happy. it’s so selfish and i just hate to feel this way."
depression,2020/02/10,"5+ years with depression, no therapy and fear of being addicted Hello everyone, I hope I can get some help here. I'm 23F, and I've been depressed since 2015, when I found out that my mum had a really rare and aggressive type of cancer. She survived the treatment but the after was horrible for everyone, especially me. I dropped college when I found out about the disease and just came back in 2017, so sometimes I feel like I lost 2 years of my life. After I went back to uni, I was sexually abused. And after 1 year of trying to forget that, broke my heart twice. I did some therapy for some time, but in my country is super expensive, and I cannot afford a session every week. My worst fear now is never getting rid of my medication, especially the bromazepam (benzodiazepine) (2,5 years with it). I went through several traumas, and Im aware that I can't go on now without my meds. 
Please, every word of comfort and every advice will be wonderful for me. I feel really really really bad about this, almost a freak. So any help would be greatly appreciated."
depression,2020/02/10,"Depressed has ruined my life There is literally no hope for me anymore. I (17F) am in my second last year of school and depression makes me unable to go to school most days. On average I can go in maybe once a week. It's always been like this, I've never had good attendance because I physically cannot go in most days. I have no interest in anything nor do I have any motivation. All I do is sleep. I'm not going to pass my exams because I haven't been in to learn the material. Im not going to get into college. I have no passion that I can persue. There is no hope for me. I have people who love me and I know it's going to hurt them when I kill myself but is that so bad when I hurt them every day by disappointing them? I'm just so done. I cant do this anymore. My life is ruined because of what I let depression do to me."
depression,2020/02/11,"I (27F) am suffering bad I feel that my depression has gotten worse. It’s past just feeling sad anymore. I feel numb to all emotions except sadness or anxiety.

I’ve battled with depression &amp; anxiety for years, accompanied by self medicating with mostly alcohol. The drinking started getting really bad the past couple of years, with some breaks in between. I also was in a physically abusive relationship that I managed to get out of. I know now that the drinking is what prevented me from getting actual help &amp; now I’m in a place so low I can’t even imagine climbing out.

It all went downhill in a matter of a couple of months starting around Christmas. I had an amazing boyfriend that was so supportive of me, but I just couldn’t break my drinking habit. I hid it from him because I was ashamed &amp; I was just stuck in this cycle of drinking to numb my emotions then being even more depressed then drinking more etc.... just going deeper &amp; deeper into the hole. 

Long story short, I had to go to jail for 2 weeks for an alcohol related charge I got an entire year ago while trying to leave my abusive ex. My mental state suffered horribly while in jail, &amp; I also found out I was pregnant. When I got out, my boyfriend broke up with me... says he wasn’t happy the last month of our relationship, &amp; that he couldn’t handle my emotional breakdowns anymore. He assured me he wanted me to keep the baby, &amp; would be there for me for the pregnancy, but just couldn’t be with me anymore.

I had to be put on house arrest about a week after I got out and probation, it is part of my conditions. I’m not allowed to leave my house at all I’m literally just holed up in my room. I found out that my ex that I’m pregnant by, is now seeing a good friend of mine. 2 weeks after breaking up with me. Then my grandmother passed away the same day I found out about my ex &amp; my friend.

I have just been completely alone in my room. I’m not on any of my meds because my dr took me off of them when I found out I was pregnant. I’m not eating, I’m barely sleeping, all I do is worry- constantly in my thoughts. I lost my job, I’m running out of money but the bills &amp; fines keep piling up, I’m living back at my parents house, I’ve lost all of my friends. I just really don’t even know what to do. I feel completely alone &amp; am so numb I barely even can cry. I start counseling this week but all I can think about is how that is just more money I don’t have.

Tl;dr
I’m so depressed that I can’t feel anything except sadness &amp; anxiety. I keep beating myself up about all of my bad choices &amp; how stupid I am. I don’t know what will help me at this point"
depression,2020/02/11,"what are the most basic essentials for a healthy mental state? A little background: I’ve (18F) been feeling very low since the beginning of october. I’m failing my last year of high school and i’ll have to take a one year break before starting college because I missed a dead line for my last really important project, therefore i’ll be unable to graduate this summer. 

I can’t bring myself to study and I’ve been sleeping almost all day after school, because I’m just incredibly tired, since I have a weird kind of sleep paralysis and have poor sleep. more often than not though, the naps are just a break from my issues. ( which is ironic, because they still follow me in my dreams.)

I kind of drown my problems in alcohol and partying on the weekends, which results in me being hungover and being even more unable to focus on my school work. 

I’m very unhappy with my body but can’t bring myself to go to the gym ( and even if i can, i’m never consistent with it) I also feel generally unhealthy and this makes me want to not take care of myself.

I basically have no discipline and  i’ve kind of always been like this, but never to this extent.
It is ruining a lot of things in my life and I don’t know how to change it. I have zero ambition and I never feel like doing anything besides lay around all day. How do I get out of this endless cycle?"
depression,2020/02/11,"I stay in bed all day and have no life. How do I get one? Hi everyone, I hope I’m at the right subreddit. I’m a 17F and I feel a lot of regret. I have been depressed for what feels like my entire life. It’s prevented me from exploring and discovering myself. All I do is lie in bed and watch Netflix or YouTube. Then I sleep. I don’t socialize at home or go out. My parents have given up on me. I take care of myself. They don’t like when I want to hang out with friends or call them at home. I been trying to get a job for months. I refuse to work at fast food. I have for a year and my manager traumatized me. All the retail places won’t hire me because I’m in high school and have no experience. I want to go to the gym but I have no money. I started running, but it’s winter, and too cold and snowy. I don’t really have enough space to work out in my room. I tried cooking but I often can’t get the supplies to cook. 

I really hate myself and because I do. I punch myself or take a pen and hit myself as much as I can. I feel like I deserve this pain. I don’t know how to get better. I’m just waiting to move out and be free."
depression,2020/02/12,"I feel such a useless and a shitty person for not able to support my boyfriend better. I (19F) have a boyfriend who is depressed (20M). We've been together for almost a year now (tomorrow is our anniversary) and I do my best to give him light whenever his depression attacks. But everytime he's in his 'episodes' he refuses to listen to every positive thing i say about him and the solutions i give him. He just turns everything i say to him upsidedown. He said that I do not have the right to feel depressed as everything has been always been working for me.

This just made me feel so useless as i cant make him feel any better. I resorted to cutting my leg, and most recently my wrist. I also tried to overdose myself with sleeping medication as i dont think im worthy enough to live."
depression,2020/02/12,"The video I watch when I need a good cry and para-social understanding I'm not trying to make a political or scientific point here, just showing off something that I find a lot of meaning in and find helps me feel more human and less alone.  
I am specifically talking about the video, Suic!de and Ment@l He@lth (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQNw2FBdpyE) by philosophytube. While I find the intellectual parts interesting, it's the theatrical and personal parts of the video that help me mentally. If you would prefer to skip the academic references and discussion and go to the part I am referring to, I usually start around 16:30 to get to the relate able and emotional part.   
My experience with it is similar to letting my feelings slip to a friend/family member and getting a hug or some other reassurance. I also specifically find that anything that has a large amount of sentimentality or meaning, even if very sad (songs and the like), helps me feel less like a walking corpse and more like a flawed, broken, but fundamentally human being that can love and feel genuine sadness. This video does have some discussion of real self harm and suicide attempts which the video does content warn against but I might as well say it. I think that things like this are important for making emotional realizations and possibly starting to get better. I'm not claiming that this will fix all your problems but for me at least it made me feel a better for a while."
depression,2020/02/12,"Am I being ungrateful? I just spent 20 minutes writing a post to press back space one too many times so I'm gonna do the short version.

I (20F) am a high functioning depressive who experiences ""episodes"" and takes an Anti. I love my job, my romantic relationship is in the best place its ever been (just waiting for the month I move), and I live comfortably. 

Right now I feel awful, that deep gut unhappiness that you can't even cry. I have only ONE reason to feel kinda bummed: my 21st is about to happen and I will be almost completely alone. I work Valentine's but boyfriend is in another city: no fun or joy that night. I see my Dad and his parents Saturday: I love them but they can be a chore due to being opinionated and Granddad's increasing dementia and refusal to hire help (different story for another time). Great relationship with my Dad. 

I will see Mum on my B-day but our relationship is more unstable because of my Entitled Sister (also long for another subreddit). That would be in the morning and then she'll go home. My other grandparents are on a month long cruise. My friends won't really care what I want to do because we do things as a class, if I don't want to go Pub, they'll go without me. 

The one person I desperately want with me got yelled at trying to get just that day off work, but having study leave up until now means they said NO. A two hour drive each way is not a reasonable request when he'd have to travel back that night. 

I know I'll get money and cards and seen after my birthday but 18th was a flop so it feels like another milestone forgotten. 

Am I being ungrateful for wanting to spend time with people over just getting money and wanting to see the people I want to see on my actual birthday?"
depression,2020/02/13,My dead end job makes me depressed just thinking about it... I’ve never had depression this bad before and I have no idea how to help myself.. Talking to friends only goes so far and I can’t afford a therapist because my job doesn’t offer me health insurance. I have a Bachelor’s degree but I am currently working a shitty high school degree job with no benefits that doesn’t pay me enough for me to live like an actual adult (I’m 26F). I feel so stuck and I feel like a fucking failure. I don’t even know what I would change my career to because I have no idea what I’m even interested in or if I’ll be truly happy with it. The thought of going to work makes me want to crash my car because I hate that place so much. I just want to be in bed all day and cry.
depression,2020/02/14,"I can’t stop freaking out about something I *didn’t* do. So I (27M) have a huge crush on a woman (33F) who goes to the same boot camp that I do. I’ve had difficulty with depression since I was 15 and have been having more intense suicidal thoughts in the last few months. This crush has been one of the biggest contributing factors as I’ve always felt very insecure about my lack of success in connecting with people romantically. 

In the past month or so I’ve tried to start casual conversations with her. These brief moments have left me feeling good afterwards, especially on one occasion where she engaged with me by asking what I studied. So I’ve been trying to make a point of asking her how her day went every time I see her. 

So at today’s class she came in a little late and finished the workout on her own. I was planning on asking her how her Valentine’s Day went and complimenting her on her pink heart socks. But I didn’t want to make it look like I was going out of my way to talk to her or approach her while she was stretching after she finished the workout. My plan was to wait by the front desk for her to come up and sign in, but she did a few more stretches than I expected so I stood there waiting a little too long. Since I had already had my coat on I decided it would be too weird to approach her while she was stretching so I just left. 

Now I can’t help but feel stupid for not trying to talk to her. I won’t see her again until the boot camp class on Monday so I’m afraid I’ll be pulling my hair out with stress all weekend. Did I do the right thing by being cautious? Should I just hope that I’ll see her in class on Monday and redeem myself then? I can’t help but feel like an idiot who is going to die alone and miserable because I never take any risks."
depression,2020/02/14,"Depressed boyfriend cheated on me on Valentine’s and blamed his mental health for it This just ruined me and I can’t get over how bad I want to swallow sleeping pills and sleep. Me (20F) been struggling with my own mental health issues since my teenage years some months were good and others just controlled my life. My boyfriend (19M) of three years has depression, and honestly he’s been pushing me away for a weeks blaming it on his mental health and how much he hates himself, and A very very low self esteem. He would leave me on read no matter what I send, whenever I need him would tell me to stop talking, doesn’t respond to me when I text him. Thought it was depression and just kept quiet coz I know how hard fighting a mental illness is. Then on Valentine’s Day someone called me and told me how he had been flirting with that girl (mind you he NEVER told me anything sweet for WEEKS, coz of “depression”) it broke me. He cried, I cried, told me how sorry he was and said “I told you I’m shit and you would be heart broken, coz I’m unavailable” . Had a lot of plans in mind to mask his depression even temporarily and it broke me so badly. 

Did depression force you to do something you didn’t want ? What is going on with him he was so faithful with me before !"
depression,2020/02/14,"[ pls don't remove I really need to talk to someone] I am depressed and too afraid to kill or hurt myself myself 20F

Sorry for possible typos but I m trembling atm.

I have been depressed for about 2 years and it all aggravated when I got into a relationship with a guy that was toxic, called me a slut and raped me the first time we had sex, used to spit in my mouth when we were having intercourse, did not respect me at all and grabbed my pussy and ass in public, made me feel like shit overall.


Now I am in a relationship with the guy I have loved for 2 years without admitting it, he s my best friend. And because of my depression and anger episodes he doesn't want me anymore. I want to change but I feel like sometimes I cannot be rational because of my depression. It's too late now I guess and I don't wanna libe without him, he's the only good thing in my life. 

It's my fault because I am toxic, I m not trying to find any excuses I know I m shit but I just want to end it and am too afraid to do anything. Every one of these things happened because my mental health is very fragile, I get hurt and upset very easy and he really tried to get over it at the beginning but now I feel like a used tool that he doesnt want anymore. We are currently long distance ( we re for the same country but he went to work in another country 2 years ago) and he was to come in my country to stay here so that we could be together and a couple of mins ago he told me he s not coming anymore.

I dont want to feel any of this hurt anymore, my father is also very sick and I cant get past this horrible feeling that took control of my mind and my sould, he was the only bit of light in my life and I fucked everything up. I cannot hurt or kill myseld because I m too much of a pussy for it and I dont know what to do.. 
I dont wanna live in a life he s not besides me..

If any of you here succeded in hurting yourselves, how did you do it without being scared?"
depression,2020/02/14,"What do I say to him? What do I say to him?

My (26F) brother (23M) attempted yesterday. Thankfully he was not successful. He called to say goodbye and tell me the he loved me. He did the same to some friends and left a note for my parents. This was a very serious attempt. He has had a lot of exceptional stressors lately in addition to the fact that he has been suffering from depression since 2018. He drove a car at 90mph into a telephone pole. Thankfully, he is getting help now and will be getting voluntary inpatient treatment until further necessary. 

I’m going to see him on Monday. What do I say? What do I do?

I don’t want to make it all about me when I see him. I’m angry, scared, and very sad about this. I’m planning to get therapy for myself to cope with the anger, trust issues, and overwhelming sadness that comes with this event. 

Info: I am a nurse practitioner and also suffer from depression so I have a solid understanding of the disease. I don’t know what to say to him because I don’t even know where to begin. Kind feedback welcome."
depression,2020/02/14,"What would happen if a non-depressed person took trintellix (not a SSRI)? I’m feeling immediate results and am wondering if it’s just placebo. I (25F) have anxiety and depression. I’ve been taking Wellbutrin for a while and haven’t really felt much different. Today my doctor prescribed me 5mg Trintellix to take in addition. After my appointment I took the 5mg and within a few (maybe 4-5) hours I felt better. Not depressed, not anxious, and actually felt excited for my future and could actually feel happiness again. I feel like my old self. 

But how is this possible? Is it placebo? As far as I understood, antidepressants take weeks to work so how am I feeling the effects right away? I know Trintellix is a less common type of antidepressant called “atypical” and am wondering if I am just uneducated on it.

Is it possible it has an immediate effect similar to benzos? 

What would happen if a non-depressed person took it?"
depression,2020/02/14,"Depressed but wanting to get better deep down (21F) TW Suicide, Self harm don't really have anyone else to turn to or talk about these kind of things with so I thought turning to reddit might help, because so many people have suffered and come through the other side better off. 

I'll try to keep this short and just say that I've had suicidal thoughts since I was about 11 years old until now. One of my parents passed away around that time and it left a void ever since, which is probably the route cause of how I feel deep down. I have a shitty relationship with most of my immediate family (including my remaining parent) because they are emotionally and have been physically abusive. I have literally 3 friends and a long term partner of 7 years. My friends are amazing, but they have their own problems so instead of overloading them I prefer to absorb their stresses. Me and my bf have had ups and downs. Although I love him dearly, I don't feel comfortable sharing my feelings of sadness with him. I finished studying for my degree and am currently looking for a job but I'm struggling to do so because I feel like living is pointless and I have no energy to exist anymore. 

I would say that I have high functioning depression because no one (except reddit now) knows what I've been doing. I've been on and off different types of anti depressants for about 4 years. I just started taking sertraline a month ago after a break of 1 year. I've tried therapy during this time too but it hasn't helped me. When I was a teen I used to self harm by cutting and picking my skin. I have always had body issues and for the past 6 months I've been binging, purging and using laxatives daily in an effort to lose weight. A few months ago I was feeling particularly low and more aggressively suicidal. I left home late at night to go to the train station. I had been crying and it was winter but I had no jacket, phone etc. and stood at the platform trying to sike myself up to jump in front of the next train. I was hesitant  because I don't want to leave my youngest sibling behind - it feels like they need me... But I literally can't escape the voices in my head that tell me I'm fucking worthless and disgusting so I wanted so badly to end it. Someone intervened and warned the station staff so I was dragged into their offices crying, which was ultimately very embarrassing. Lately I look at suicide methods online all the time. I don't have a particular time or date for ending things, but I still know that I want this to be over. I should also note that I hate reaching out to suicide hotlines/samaritans as I don't feel like they helped in previous experiences I had a few years ago. I am too ashamed to admit myself anywhere because I hate the thought of my family and partner beginning to question everything they think they know about me.

I have seen so many success stories online about people managing and overcoming their mental illnesses but I don't make any progress. It feels like I'm slipping deeper into a void where I feel nothing but numbness and self loathing. I'm actually jealous of the fact that one of my parents are dead and I'm still here. I just want to know what I'm doing wrong in instances where other people seem to go right."
depression,2020/02/16,"Dont want to do it anymore (27F) 4 years ago I was diagnosed with an incurable chronic pain disease. Its nicknamed the ""suicide disease"" because over half of long term patients kill themselves. My life has been an absolute shit show lately. My wife (24F) randomly decided one day that she didnt want this to be her life. We've been together for 7 years married for 1 in about a month. I've exhausted all my treatment options for this disease so basically it's just pain meds for the rest of my life. I'm a very rational person so thoughts of suicide are splitting me into two different people. I dont want to hurt my mother or grandmother but at this point it seems like what other option is there? My entire life has been like dodging bombs. Every time I thought it couldnt get worse it did. I use to joke about how the universe was testing me to see how much itd take to kill myself. I wish our country was like others where assisted suicide was allowed. I dont want to live the rest of my life in crippling pain being a burden to others.


TL;DR Struggling with a chronic disease"
depression,2020/02/16,"Is there a point where it genuinely may be worth giving up? Since I was very young—my first memories really—I’ve had this desire to just “stop existing.” Not so much actively kill myself, but I would just wish as a kid I could just disappear and that I had never been born. As I’ve gotten older (24F) it hasn’t gotten better. I’m very successful, I’m liked by my peers, I have people in my life that love me, but I don’t feel joy for any of it and still have that persistent wish that I could just... not, sometimes. 

I’ve tried antidepressants, and many. I could list them, but basically every class including ones traditionally for other disorders technically (for instance, ADHD medications). I gave them all a fair trial, 4 months usually. Usually I would have an up kick in positive feelings the first week or two, and then nothing. Even increasing the dose wouldn’t bring the feeling back. 

I’ve tried switching birth controls. I’ve tried going OFF birth control, for over a year, twice. 

I’ve done talk therapy. I like my current therapist, she’s very kind and listens well usually, but I think she’s at a loss for suggestions because I myself have so proactively tried to fix this and failed. I don’t want to die. I just don’t want to be. Does that make sense at all? 

I’m just tired, I guess. It’s been a lifetime and no amount of success or things that should be good experiences has brought me a sense of inner happiness. I don’t want to hurt the people who care about me, I think that’s why I’m not seeking escape options at all. But it’s tiring existing for them."

It was unexpected and I wasn't prepared for it. I had a few opportunities when driving out to text everyone. I told the majority of people that I'm not going to be available any time soon.

But everyone seemed so uninterested. My parents  didn't even seem worried nor asked if I was okay. I asked my bf if he'd like to hang out today to catch up but he said no. He said he was tired and doesn't feel like hanging out (even though he suggested it). I was supposed to go to a game with a couple of my friends but they literally just ghosted me and left me at my apartment...

Flash forward and I’m really struggling. I’ve had a bunch of other things come up like switching hormonal birth control and having some fights with my family, not to mention the massive fires ripping through my home of Australia, complete disillusionment with our government, and being smothered in bushfire smoke. It’s over now, but things are still hard at the moment. I’ve reversed my birth control changes and gone back onto my meds because of this crisis and it’s been a bit over a week now with no improvement yet.

I’m finding this is manifesting the worst in my work. I’m a freelance graphic designer and I spent all of last year building my business and getting some really great contracts. I felt confident, happy, energised and fulfilled. But ever since I weaned off my meds last year things haven’t been right - I’ve been exhausted and had to take sick days consistently for months, and I’ve had the most insane art block. I have such little inspiration and I feel so zombie-like. It’s scary, and it comes with a wallop of anxiety about not being good enough and a fear of being seen as lazy. I also feel like I put my whole heart into my work and when it’s hard to complete it to the best of my ability I feel like shit about myself and like I’m letting my clients and myself down.

Sometimes I wonder if I’d be better off working in an office job, even though it would take away my creative freedom - because it’d make me get out of the house and do things. But all the previous jobs I’ve had have been a massive struggle, and I would sometimes look at people working full time and just not understand how they can do it every day. I’m scared that I’m not going to be able to be a functioning member of society and that I’ll end up homeless because I struggle to work like a normal person. I know that’s catastrophising. But even people with severe mental illness seem to be able to do 9-5 without breaking down sometimes. 

How do you guys cope with flare-ups of mental illness and work? How do you handle the fatigue that comes with it? What happens when you have projects waiting and your reputation on the line?"
depression,2020/02/17,"Just need to vent... I’ve never posted here before, so I hope this is okay. It’s a really long post so I’m sorry, but I just need a place to vent right now bc my depression is really spiraling. 

I’m 27F, and I have been dealing with depression probably since I was a child, but didn’t start seeing anyone about it/get officially diagnosed until I was 18. I never told my parents - my dad always told us only the weak had mental health issues. The strong “sucked it up and dealt with it.” I’ve spent a long time trying to stop feeling ashamed for needing help, and about a year ago I FINALLY felt like I was in a good place and I was really proud of myself for holding on. 

Well I made the mistake of accidentally mentioning to my dad that I was seeing a therapist, and he asked me what for. He wasn’t initially judgy, so I thought maybe I could finally open up about my mental health struggles. He proceeded to tell me how ashamed he was of me, how he doesn’t know me, how he always thought I was so strong for dealing with my cancer the way I did but now he knows it was all a lie. He asked me how long I’ve been crazy, asked me how how any kid of his could be like this. 

I’m just so devastated. I’ve worked so hard to get my issues under control, and with that one conversation Ive been thrown back so many steps. I’m sitting here full of shame and embarrassment, drowning in my own feelings of worthlessness and self-doubt. I don’t even have a good relationship with my father - His opinion shouldn’t matter. But it does. It matters so much and it’s so pathetic. And I’m so angry that the strength I thought I had was diminished so quickly. Like, is there even any point in trying to recover when it can all be ripped away with just one conversation? I’m just so overwhelmed. And it’s so pathetic."

Looking for advice or insight - my (26F) partner (27M) has low-functioning depression, while I have high-functioning depression.

He thinks he's a burden to me, and that he's too empty for this to be successful. He initially called things off between us, but then felt like potential love was worth it, and so here we are. After incredible days together, he feels like he has to go back to real life, as if the happiness he felt wasn't normal or allowed.

depression,2020/02/18,"It's getting worse My \[28M\]'s girlfriend \[26F\] has always had depression. She's always been sad, low energy, lonely, hopeless. And I've always been here, loving her anyway.

Recently, however, it's escalated. Her anxiety has become severe. Her habit of picking scabs and pulling out hair has accelerated to the point of no return. Her bald spot and severe open sores would make it hard for anyone to want to leave the house, much less a depressed person. 

She cannot/does not function at all. She will sleep for up to 72 hours straight, she talks about how she hates herself and doesn't want to live. When she does manage to get out of bed, the most minor inconveniences induce a panic attack and/or crying fit. The most recent example.. running out of dishwasher fluid.

I've been supportive for so long, and I will continue to be. But what happens next? over the past 7 years, it's been new meds, new doctors, inpatient, repeat. How does this ever end? She's only gotten worse, with her school and career to a place of no return. I can't see her ever climbing out of this hole. And as her boyfriend, what do I do? I can't force her to feel better, I can only offer my support. But I've been doing that for years and it's only gotten worse. What can I do? How can I make this end?

depression,2020/02/19,"35F severely depressed but not suicidal: how to get help I think I have always been somewhat depressed ever since teenager, but never sought actual mental health help because I was able to somehow put it in the background and get on with my everyday life. However, since the beginning of this year my condition has worsened significantly. I cry and cannot control myself for several hours every day and it is very hard to calm myself down. I have a boyfriend since 4 years but he has been away for nearly 3 months now - he decided to take time off between jobs and went back to stay with his family in Europe. I think him going away was a major trigger, as I am alone in the house and just doing work-home. I was alone on xmas, new years, valentine's and it was, well, depressing.  I love him very much but his going for so long without me indicated to me that he is much less attached and our relationship is not reciprocal. Also, I work as a postdoctoral scientist in academia and my funding is ending soon but I have been unable to find a job (despite doing fairly well scientifically, what a waste of time) facing real possibility of unemployment. Finally, I have a high chance of infertility due to not only my age but also underlying health issues. So I am in this dark cloud of despair. The only person who knows about my mental health issues is my partner but he somehow does not take it seriously, he thinks it is just my way to get attention. 

So I thought I need professional help, but I contacted my insurance (U.S.) and their first available appointment is in May, 3 months from now. I cannot go on like this for 3 months, I need some medicines to keep me calm, I think. I eat healthy, I exercise 4-5 days a week, but doesn't seem to help.  I am not just sad all the time, but get hysterical with these crying spells and then I am too exhausted to fall asleep (somehow?!) and it is a spiral down. I average \~5 hours of sleep according to my fitbit and then I usually have very unpleasant dreams. I think they don't consider me as an emergency because I told that I am not suicidal which I indeed am not. Of course it crosses my mind and it is an obvious solution for my personal suffering, but I wouldn't ever hurt my mom so it is out of question. Is there anything over the counter? I tried some anti-anxiety supplements with GABA, 5HTC etc., but they are not working (I didn't have high hopes as evidence for their efficiency is not there but I thought maybe placebo would be enough - no). I think I cannot afford private therapy (the postdoc salary is a joke), but I also don't know how to find a therapist and understand the costs. I am an ex-pat, my family is back in Europe and I arrived here in the US 5 years ago and while I know some people from work, I don't have any friends that are close enough so I can talk mental health with them or ask for recommendation. What should I do?"
depression,2020/02/19,"I feel like I am sinking and I can't get out. This past month my depression has hit me (26F) harder than ever. My best friend of 15 years decided she needed space from me, and stopped talking to me. The group I always hung out with was her friends, though I have known them for years, however naturally I stopped being invited to things. This hurt a lot. Also, I moved away for a few years and now I am back in town, but everyone's lives moved on with out me (obviously). However, the final cherry on top of this enormous sundae of depression, is that this guy I really liked, and have been dating for a few months, tried to hook up with other girls at a party HE invited me too. Then the next day told me my feelings were one sided and that I was just a casual dating experience until he found someone he actually liked.

I feel lonely, but don't have the energy to be around people either. I am a type A personality and super extroverted, so staying home makes me feel even worse. I've pretty much stopped eating at this point because my depression took over my appetite, and I see myself quickly spiraling down a path that I struggled so hard for many years to get out of (a few years ago I was suicidal). Now I am having the same thoughts again. ""Is it really worth it to live anymore"" ""People will be sad, but they will quickly get over it"" ""I have no one to talk too"" ""Maybe I should just give everything up and curl in a ball forever""

I hate that I am feeling like this, I finally got in touch with a psychiatrist and she prescribed me anti-depressants, however, until they start working, or even if they ever do, I don't know how to feel better. I am trying to do a lot of self care and positive mantras, however nothing is working. I can't get myself to even do anything anymore.

Help. Please. Anyone."
depression,2020/02/20,"Really struggling today, been really down since a break up in December. I'm 29F, and had my first ever relationship in September. It lasted three months and he was everything. I've been broken since it ended but I've been feeling a little bit better after going to the doctors and being prescribed tablets for my anxiety and depression.

However, I saw my ex last night and a tiny part of me was hoping he would come back and we would get back together, because I honestly feel like we're unfinished but last night cemented that it isnt going to happen.

I've been crying all day, it feels like the day of the break up all over again, but worse. I feel lost and I just dont know what the point is in anything any more. I dont have a reason to do anything, and I barely have any friends and i feel like if I disappeared no one would notice.

My work is also fairly stressful, but that's manageable although its been tricky this week because my heads just been all over the place. I just dont feel like myself, or who I even am at this point."
depression,2020/02/20,"How to know if you have depression, if you've always been like this? Hey reddit,

So, After reading a post on r/consulting about a man who's been struggling lately, and having everyone comment how he was likely depressed, I've begun to wonder, if perhaps I am too, since my entire life seemd to be exactly like what he describes, Perhaps high-functioning depression? I know most of you are going to tell me to see a therapist, and I'll consider it, but the reason I ask is because I've always lived like this and felt pretty fine doing so. I want to know what ""normal people"" do.

I'm 25F btw.

Anyways,

I have a decent job, pays well, not too hard, and it is comfortable. I manage to show up every day,work, go for lunch, and go home.

My day consists of waking up at 6:30... staying in bed lamenting my fate until about 7:30, then getting ready quickly, barely having breakfast, and getting into 1hr of traffic to get to work.

I get to work, these day I dont have much to do, so I come on reddit, or wait until my boss gives me a task. Some days there are meetings so I go to that. Tbh I just do whatever I'm asked to do.

Then at about 6:00pm I go home, 1hr drive, get home at 7, usually be on my phone or lay around until 8:00, then eat dinner, then I'm in bed by 9:30 probably texting or watching a show, and I go to bed at 10pm.

God it sounds so miserable writing it all down. I try to at least once a week, during the weekday, go visit a friend, or go to the movies, or meet someone for coffee.

Then comes the weekend.

Friday I usually don't do much, or I go to the movies, or maybe I'll go on a date. Saturdays I kind of just lay in bed waiting for the day to pass, maybe I'll read, or take my dog out to the park. Then at night I almost always go out, usually for drinks with friends.

Sundays I just chill all day and spend the day with my family and in my room.

Rinse and repeat???? this sounds so sad. I'm young, attractive, ""full of life"" and potential. I dont feel particularly unhappy or depressed, yet I might be?

My question is, what do normal people do? and what could I do to make my life better?

I've been like this since I can remember. College was the same, go to class, go home, study and lay in bed. Then see friends (I don't have many, only a few close ones) on the weekend. Then repeat."

depression,2020/02/20,"What the fuck is the point thoooooo I’m 25F and just want to give up. I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar, trichitillomania, and OCD and they make everyday life pretty unbearable. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about these things, my parents made me go to therapy and CBT in high school because they were so ashamed by my hair pulling but it never helped. Tried Zoloft and Prozac, no help. I think about suicide everyday but I would probably never do it because I couldn’t do that to my parents, my boyfriend, and my pup. I went to a pretty good university and got a biology degree, but now I work a job in R&amp;D that I hate and I’m definitely underpaid. I rarely feel happy and I don’t really enjoy doing anything. I spend all day at work wishing I was home and then I get home and just want to sleep, even watching TV isn’t appealing. I’m gaining weight and losing hair, I hate how I look even if I know it’s stupid to care about that. I feel so awkward all the time, I don’t think people tend to like me that much. I’m (hopefully) not mean or annoying, I’m just usually pretty quiet (unless I’m drinking) and nobody thinks twice about me. I think a lot about how if I killed myself people would be so shocked because I never complain and probably seem somewhat normal. It comes in waves and maybe it’s just a bad day/month/year but I just have no interest in carrying on. I feel terrible because people who actually want to live die everyday for all sorts of reasons but I wish I would get really sick or in an accident just so I could be dead but not have the stigma of suicide."

SO....this is my first time talking to anyone outside of my husband and a close friend so I really don't know what to expect. I was wondering if anyone can tell me about their experiences with seeing a counselor and what I can expect, etc.

depression,2020/02/21,"Am I doing the right thing? My ex girlfriend (22F) broke up with me (23F) last week because of her depression. She told me she’s not in the right headspace for a relationship. It came really out of the blue we were making our plans for the weekend and an hour later she sent me a break up text. In she said she was feeling just very trapped in her life, that the world was crushing her, that she still loves but she thinks I deserve someone who will love me better and give me better, that she wasn’t enough for me. I feel completely differently I think the world of her, she loves me better than I ever thought possible. But I didn’t argue with, I just let her know I love her. And that was that. But I started feeling really wrong about something. She’s in a terrible place right now and I just needed her to know that she could always reach out to me for anything in any capacity. As a friend, lover, stranger whatever I’m there for her. I also made it clear that I know she needs space so I won’t text her after this unsolicited. I’ve never dealt with depression so I guess I’m just wondering was this an ok thing to do?

TL;DR: depressed gf broke up with me bc she isn’t in the right headspace, but said she still loves me. I broke NC a week in to let her know I’ll always be here for her but I won’t text her unsolicited after letting her know that. Was that ok?"
depression,2020/02/21,"I (24M)am severely depressed I broke up with my (23F) of 9.5 years and I realized I'm interested in men instead of women  

About  4 months ago I (24m) had broken off a 9 and a half year  relationship  with someone (23f) I thought I was going to spend my life  with I love  her and she was my best friend and I do still love and care  about her.  The beginning of the breakup things were really bad she hated  my guts  and things were not going well, I moved out and got my own  apartment of  course. Reasons I had broken this off is because things had  gotten  extremely toxic with fighting all the time some times physical  as well.  Something I had come to realize is I am attracted to men..  which is  probably why I was no longer interested in the sexual aspect of  things.  4 months later her and I are doing well, we text or snapchat  eachother  and I go over to her house once in a while to visit the dog  and cat  that we had gotten together in the past. She has told me about  guys  that she has been talking to or trying to talk to and also told me   about a potential date she has coming up possibly. We are now pretty   good friends and have agreed that we were not good together. About 3   days ago I had started talking to a guy I met on tinder and plan to meet   him this weekend in person. My problem is I still care and love for  her  even if I am not attracted to women sexually, I feel so guilty  pursuing  this whatever it may be with this guy I just started talking  to, I do  enjoy talking to him but part of me is considering ""ghosting""  him  because of the guilt I feel, because I'm the one that ended the   relationship so I feel guilt thinking I don't deserve to be happy since I   had made her sad when I ended the relationship. This guilt is causing   me to have anxiety attacks it sucks. Thank you to anyone who can give   some advice. 

(UPDATE) she said she doesn't want to be friends she either wants us to be together or nothing and if I choose nothing I can no longer visit the dog and cat that were ours that live with her. I am too afraid to come out to anyone even friends and especially to her as I have a huge fear of being judged which I know for a fact my friends will end up either stop talking to me completely or judge me a lot and I know for a fact that she will not take it well at all.

depression,2020/02/22,"Feeling really lonely after a breakup TL:DR After a very shakey few months, we finally broke up and it's tearing me apart. 

Before we were together, he (18M) was my (17F) best friend. We would talk all the time and hang out like friends do. Our relationship was very fulfilling, at least for me. I had never felt so connected to someone, and I don't mean romantically. I was able to understand his likes, his reasoning, his personality etc in a way that felt natural. That never happened to me before. Not even with my family or any past friends. 

Not only are we not together, but he doesn't even want to talk to me (long story) and I feel so empty. We would find time to tell each other about our days and he really was such an important part of my life. I know I was a handful. I have so many panic attacks and rapid mood swings, but he never made me feel like I was a burden to him. I never thought that I would be able to make anyone happy in the way that I was apparently making him.

I feel so mad at myself. I think back at the times when I would be upset because I wouldn't see him as much as I would have liked or that he fell asleep before we could say goodnight. I would give anything to have that again. I just want to go back in time and relive every moment so that I can fully appreciate what I had. 

I feel so stupid for letting myself fall into it so deep. He was my first everything; from the first person to show genuine interest in being in my life to more physical milestones. Now it's all gone. My light in so much darkness. We're teenagers? What did I expect? Yet somehow I still feel into the trap. 

I thought we were more than just some teenage fling. I thought I actually had some greater value in his life than to just pass the time. Now I'm finding myself grieving a relationship that feels like was all in my head. 

I can't stop crying. I just want all this to go away."
depression,2020/02/22,"Has anyone been fell in love again with your ex after you’re no longer depressed? About 4 years ago, I (20F) used to be depressed and I fell out of love with my bf. I broke up with him. But after I was no longer depressed, I’ve just realized the fact that I still love him but yeah it's too late.

Time goes by, I met my recent bf (21M) and we started to date. He was diagnosed with depression before I met him. We got along well with each other. Everything seems perfect but suddenly his depression became severe. He felt exactly the same way I used to feel. I’ve tried to tell him this feeling is not permanent but failed. He always feels down when he can't force himself to be happy around me. And always thought he can only bringing trouble and sadness to me. He also said he doesn't feel like he loves me as much as before and can't take care of anyone else's feeling now. So we decided to break up to save our own mental health.

All the feelings depression did to him was used to happen with me. But I’m wondering if it was only me who started to fall in love again with the same person after I’m no longer depressed or not? Do I still have a chance to get back with him since we didn’t have got any big problems in our relationship (except the fact he is now depressed) before?

In November, my long term relationship ended and I had to move out of our shared home, leaving our dog and his daughter that I’ve grown to love. I’m 42F, and this relationship was on/off for 8 years. I do truly love him, and can’t seem to get past the life we were building together. I feel so unbelievably lonely. I’ve tried dating new people, and keeping myself distracted, but it all just reminds me how empty I feel. 

Around that same time, my parents sold our family home and moved away from my hometown, which has been a great source of loss for me because it’s the only place I’ve ever felt like I belonged. I live several hours away and now have no reason to ever go “home” again. It’s an unsettling feeling. 

In December, my grandmother that raised me for the first 12 years of my life entered hospice and passed away in January. She was one of the closest people in my life. 

A week later, someone I cared about threatened/attempted suicide and I had to talk them off the ledge. It was an unhealthy and manipulative friendship that I have since had to cut off for my own sanity. 

Less than a week later, I had to put my cat to sleep. I’d had him 16.5 years. He had been with me through dozens of moves (one halfway across the country and back), and probably just as many relationships! I always joked that he was the only man that ever stuck with me. This is the first time in my entire 42 years that I’ve ever lived in a house without another heartbeat in it. It’s lonely, but no more pets for me. 

Last week, I just found out that the owners of my company are restructuring and bringing in new management in 2 weeks, and our office staff may not get to keep our jobs. I have savings to tide me over for a couple of months if I do end up unemployed, but it’s hard to find a job doing what I do. And I work with 2 of my closest friends, and they honestly get me through the day lately with as much going on as I do. Losing their daily support would kill me. 

Honest to god, it feels like the universe is playing a sick joke on me. How much more can I lose?!? Who have I pissed off up there?!? 

I know I need to see a counselor, but given that I may be unemployed soon, I can’t commit to making that weekly payment. (I’m sure there may be low cost options out there somewhere, but I imagine the waiting list for those is ten miles long. And I don’t want to take away spots that should be used by people with worse/more acute issues than I do. So counseling will have to wait until I know that I have a job.) I have very few friends to lean on, and no one really knows what to say to me other than, “It just takes time. Things will get better. You have to experience the grief as it comes and time will heal you.” Yeah, I know that logically. But it doesn’t help me RIGHT NOW, doesn’t keep me from being overly touchy or irritable, or keep me from being sad and crying all the time. And those same people that say to just experience the grief are getting kind of irritable that I’m not my usual bouncy self (even though I’m doing my damnedest not to ever cry in front of them) and don’t want to just...let me be. 

Any words of wisdom to help me keep going and prevent my traumas from overwhelming me?"

depression,2020/02/23,"I (23F) never feel 100% good, health wise, and I don’t know why. It’s pulling me into depression. I can’t remember the last time I woke up and felt absolutely great. There’s always something off - my head hurts, my stomach hurts, my throat hurts, I feel dizzy or aloof or anxious or something. I always feel off. 


I do have Generalized Anxiety Disorder but I am on medication for it to be managed. I don’t know why I constantly feel this way. It’s pulling me away from family and friends and making me not want to do anything. I don’t know why. I don’t know if it’s because I’m depressed and these are just signs of that. I don’t know if it’s because a relapse in my anxiety has happened. I don’t know if there’s actually something physically wrong with me. All of this doesn’t help my anxiety, but I try and manage and push through but at times I just can’t. 


Has anyone ever dealt with something like this, and if so what happened? Was something actually wrong or were you just in a weird funk?"
depression,2020/02/23,"GP didn’t do much 18F I’ve be suffering the symptoms of depression for over a year now and only recently has it gotten to the extent of becoming unbearable. It got to the point where my parents themselves, initially very right wing and “skeptical” of mental health issues, encouraged me to go to the doctors for some help

My appointment took a month to process and I attended, told her as much as I could despite my fears (excluding alcohol use) though she really didn’t offer much help. She said antidepressants are for major cases and she insinuated that therapy is a very long winded solution. I feel as if she didn’t get the gist of the severity of my situation as I have an automatic façade of being “sweet” and innocent to strangers because I get really bad anxiety they’re going to hate me. I couldn’t even penetrate through this social mask to tell her the truth, all I ended up doing is crying at her desk. She was very young herself and seemed unsure what to do, after all she is medically trained for more physical issues than mental

Now I’m just stuck in this continuous rut of crying and hating everyday of my life so much. The fuck are you meant to do now? It’s severe enough to hinder you from getting out of bed and showering but not severe enough to overcome my intolerance of pain to kill myself."
depression,2020/02/23,"My depression is ruining me. I'm a 21F. I have been stuck in a loveless relationship for five years that I have recently just ended. I cannot get out of bed, I cannot function properly. The thought of leaving my own home causes anxiety. I don't eat. I smoke too much weed. I drink too much. Drugs are the only way I can cope. 

I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm so sick of living. But hey, I have so much ahead of me, right? I'm going to be successful. I know I will. 

However, there is so much pain. I think I've been emotionally, mentally, and sometimes physically abused my whole life. I just want to feel real love. 

I just wanted to splurge my feelings. I'm intoxicated and alone. I just want a hug."
depression,2020/02/24,"Failing grades Hello everyone, I’m new to Reddit (in an attempt to seek help and advice) 
I (18F) have struggled with the feeling of underwhelming sadness for about 3 years. The reason I don’t give this a title, such as depression, is because I haven’t seeked medical advice or been diagnosed - so I don’t feel it’s appropriate to diagnose myself. But I do believe it may be a case of depression. 
I didn’t enjoy school due to lack of understanding particular subjects and feeling I was more behind than my peers. The only subjects I excelled in was Art &amp; Design and English. But despite even that, I was so unmotivated to do it and I could’ve really hit the high grades if I had tried harder and studied before exams, something I didn’t do. 
From a young age I took to a passion for Aviation. I remember flying for the first time and being absolutely drawn in to the industry. I remember my flight being delayed for 2 hours and the entire time I had my little face pressed up against the glass over looking the Airside area, fixed to the activity going on below and taking it all in. My ambition was to be a flight attendant. After finishing school at 16, I got a place in my dream college. A college specific for Aviation. It was a long way from home but I managed to make it work. I’m still attending now, this is my second year. 

And this second year is what I would like to address in this passage. The issue is that I am behind in my work... extremely behind. I have no other excuse than myself for this. I’m going to try and explain this the best way I can in the hopes some of you guys may have been through similar, if not the same thing. 
I absolutely love the subject I am studying and I’m very blessed to be attending and have a seat in the class. I still very much wish to be a flight attendant, so it’s not a case of not having a passion for learning. I want to learn. I haven’t lacked motivation in that area, but where my work is concerned I just cannot do it. It’s not a case of not understanding, because when I do eventually get around to my work, I believe I can do it well. I just cannot bring myself to be organised, motivated and work before the deadline. Even after my work is late, I simply cannot force myself to address it. It’s like a weight that holds me down in my bed and convinces me the work can be left. 
I don’t know how to describe it. 
I can’t be organised and do my work in regular intervals to ensure my work meets the deadline. It’s like a constant fight between my heart and my head. 
I hate disappointing my tutors, which have been so lovely to me, however I have not spoken to them about how I feel. I feel guilty and ashamed when I walk into college without the work they have been expecting or expected. 
I want to be successful in my course but I’m proving not to be, and if I’m unlucky, I worry for my place on the course. 
Sometimes the paperwork doesn’t make sense to me and I cannot understand what is being asked of me. 
I am extremely sad about this because I work outside of college and I am a good, understanding and hard worker. I’m better at practical work than class-based. I believe I could be a successful flight attendant, given the opportunity... but I’m worried I will not achieve the grades to get there due to these issues. 

Please help with any advice? 
Thank you"
depression,2020/02/24,"I feel guilty for being depressed I feel guilty for being depressed...which makes me feel ungrateful...which makes me guilty...which makes me more depressed. 29F

I have many blessings in my life - my health, my family, my loving partner, a great education, a great job, financial resources, a lot of wonderful things...but I'm still depressed on a day-to-day basis and I feel terribly guilty about it. Based on all of these blessings, I should be very happy and content, but I'm not. I am melancholy at times, agitated, irritable and unpleasant. 

I have scrupulosity OCD, which is essentially an overly active moral compass and makes me empathize and feel compassion very deeply. It also comes with a lot of guilt. If I see a homeless person or someone less privileged, I often think, ""that should be me"" or "" maybe God should give me something to REALLY cry about. and then I'll learn to appreciate my life.""

I don't really know why I'm posting here, just venting, I suppose.

Does anyone have any tips for just accepting yourself and your depression?"
depression,2020/02/24,"My (27F) partner (25F) is suffering from depression, I need some support. We've been together for 5 years, known each other for 10. I've seen her through drug abuse, mistakes with guys before me, break ups with me to try to shield me from taking my joy away, etc.
This weekend however we talked about her depression as she is having a 'dark moment' atm (few weeks of numbing out to Netflix and feeling like doing less and less activities).
I'm very empathetic but tend to take some thing personally.
I too suffer from a chronic illness and require some attention after my surgeries but I'm extremely optimistic and jolly overall. She says I'm like this colorful little one.
I would love LOVE LOVE
some suggestions on what I need to know so I dont get insecure and learn more about depression in general. Because I know her case personally and she has continuously reminded me that I cant do anything about it other than a few things but I love working with people (I work with kids with disabilities) and understanding them. 
Anything I need to know ALWAYS? That I cant keep forgetting about but it's easy to forget?

THANK YOU in advance"
depression,2020/02/25,"(23F) Separated from husband with 50/50 custody of 2 year old I suffered pretty bad from PPD after having my son. It didn’t help that my husband was toxic and had his own problems. Now we’re on better terms but separated and he’s paying for me to live in my own 3 bedroom house, for the sake of it feeling like another home for my stepkids. Totally love that it’s awesome. But 95% of the time it’s me and half of the week it’s my son and I. I’ve been eating right and exercising daily for the past month and a half, feeling so good about myself. Yesterday I got my son back and was so happy. I meal prepped in the kitchen with fun music while simultaneously playing with my kiddo. A really amazing day. Well today I could hardly get out of bed when he woke up at 5. Obviously that’s wayyyyy too early for anyone so I just put it off as being tired. But then I noticed a pattern. When he’s here, he wakes up early, we have way too much screen time in the morning because for three hours I physically cannot get out of bed (for anything for myself but I’ll grab him his breakfast/snacks/diaper and we will just be in bed). Then I just feel like I can’t do anything. Dishes?? No fucking way!! I haven’t done laundry in forever, and my house after three months still isn’t fully furnished. I type that and think I’m just lazy. But holy hell, I took my son to the museum today and that was the biggest feat I think I’ve ever pulled. Just making that move to get out of bed, get myself dressed, get him dressed, leave the house... now I feel so heavy. My head actually feels pressure pushing me down. I don’t want to do anything. I had a three day streak where I didn’t brush my teeth or my hair, and that’s still while dieting and exercising. I think I am always depressed, but on some days I can do more things than others and distract myself. 

Anyway. Meeting my STB ex tonight with my stepkids for a show. Another thing that I have to force myself to do without thinking of vomiting."
depression,2020/02/25,"a little ramble I (18F) don't know what to do. I feel so unlovable, yet I know there's so many people around me who do. My family, my friends, and even my pets (lol). They all do so much for me and I am so grateful but I still feel empty and unsatisfied. I'm so depressed and I know there's only so much the people around me can do, and they've already done more than enough. I tell myself that it's romantic love I want, but I shutdown whenever someone actually considers going on a date with me. I'm scared of meeting new people or something. I still hang around my ex and no matter how he tries to make it clear that we're done romantically, I still believe that somehow someday soon he's gonna take me back. I dunno, sorry for this rant."

I just can’t start a new serious relationship. There might be a sign I’m sending wrong. I only had a few interactions and short datings.

depression,2020/02/25,"Feeling detached from myself + people (disassociation?) It's like there's 2 parts of me

1. The part underneath, the real me - that feels broken, fragile, weak, and just tired.

2. The part that people see / that comes out when people I love are around me - it's like I automatically get happier, look normal and feel okay (not completely better mentally, but okay).

I've been in this rut for 2 years now I'd say.
It's gotten so much worse this last year, since I started spending all my time in my room.
I'd eat, sleep, wake up (phone), eat and sleep. This cycle goes on for weeks.

I'm 19F for reference, I've tried so many times to get out of it but it's so damn hard!

What should I do?"
depression,2020/02/26,"I (22F) am in a downward spiral and it never stops This is my first ever post on reddit so I’m sorry if it violates any rules or anything! This is super long so there will be TLDR at the end...

The world is ending and that is the only way to describe how I feel. The world is ending and I’m suffocating but it’s not to anybody else. 

Background: I’ve had depression/anxiety for as long as I can remember. I have a wildly complicated/horrible relationship with my mother (a single mother who raised me, an only child, by herself) and a friendly relationship with my father who wasn’t around much until I was like 10 so it’s like not at all a parental kind of relationship. 

I’m in my last semester of college and it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I’m overloaded with 21 hours of classes and working 8 hours 2 days a week. 

I don’t have any friends. I used to but as I get older the depression gets worse. My self esteem is wrecked. I have incredible social anxiety that’s also gotten worse as I get older. The actual only human contact I have is my wonderful boyfriend (21M) who lives with me. He is patient and supportive in every way possible and showed me what love truly is. His family are amazing people and I love them too. They are everything I wanted in my family as a kid. 

I regularly see a therapist and a psychologist and am on medication. Two things have triggered my downward spiral: the loss of a written prescription of my antidepressants which has caused me to be off them for about a month (but I have since found and been back on them but only for about 5 days and this is also 100% my fault and I’m kicking myself for this) and the severing of my relationship with my mother. She had me young (21) and we have had a super insane relationship with no boundaries at all whatsoever. She is my absolute best friend in the whole world but also the cause of my depression and anxiety, regularly verbally and emotionally manipulating and abusing me since I hit puberty. 

BECAUSE OF ALL OF THIS I am incredibly depressed and anxious and it’s getting worse with each passing day. Something new happens with my mother almost every day where she has been cold to me. But on top of this, I have been physically sick with the flu (which is going around in my area) &amp; it has caused me to miss my class last week. It is 3 days a week for 4 hours. But I am able to work at home because we use our laptops to run the program we work on, so I have been keeping up with schoolwork. 

Last Friday was our midway presentation on our final projects (I graduate this May) and I ended up having a full on panic attack because I didn’t have enough money to print my presentation out on my university account and I left my wallet at home because my boyfriend drove me to school. It was already past time the class had started so I ran outside to try to calm down but everything had built up and I couldn’t stop crying. Needless to say I didn’t go to class. I emailed my professor an embarrassingly cringey email about what happened and he hasn’t responded. (Attendance is important in this class)

This past weekend was Mardi Gras which I did NOT participate in because it turns out I have a sinus infection right after getting the flu. I have a dr note for this. 

I relapsed on my antibiotics and had to go back today to get a stronger prescription. Mardi Gras classes resumed today at 12:30. My class starts at 1:30. I got a drs note because I obviously still feel bad (coughing up mucus, sneezing constantly, blowing my gross snotty nose every 5 seconds, deep mucusy cough every 10 seconds. It’s NOT pretty) and the class is freaking 4 hours long and I don’t want to subject anyone else to that either??? The classroom is tiny. 

So I sent him it. I said I can present when I come back this Friday. He has yet to respond to that too. 
I’m terrified I’m going to fail and not graduate. I have to graduate because I have an amazing job lined up for me afterwards.

TLDR: it feels like bad thing after bad thing keeps happening to me and I really want to just give up but i have so much pressure to not give up that it makes me so fucking anxious!!!

My anxiety is CRIPPLING me right now. I don’t really know why I posted this and I’m not really expecting any responses. But if you had any kind words to say that would be really appreciated..."
depression,2020/02/27,"I am a failure and I deserve to die I'm 21F, living far away from my family because of uni. This is my first year at university and I attended very few classes (i'm probably gonna fail EVERYTHING). I can't stand it. Last year was exactly the same, but different university. I feel bad for my parents because the are paying for everything (rent, food, school, etc) and everything I do is stay in bed and cry 24/7 because I'm too depressed to be fucking functional like a normal person. They are like the emotionally abusive parents and they never supported me. I'm scared to told them I'm feeling the same as the last 4 years and I'm gonna drop out. I feel like this world is not for me. I don't know what to do with my life and this was my last chance at uni.

I have been diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety and social anxiety (severe). I go to therapy but seems like is not working at all and I don't have money to pay for a better therapist.I have suicidal thougts almost everyday. I don't have any friends so I feel very lonely and I don't have no one to talk to."
depression,2020/02/27,"After isolating, I feel awkward reconnecting. I need help. This is going to be a bit of a long post, but I want to give some context: 

I've struggled with depression my (34F) entire life. There are periods where my depression is debilitating (complete loss of appetite for months, suicidal ideation, getting out of bed in the morning takes every last ounce of energy) and there are times where it is completely functional and I feel okay. I had a very bad downswing that started in the fall of 2018, got a little better in the spring, got really bad again over the summer, and then became pretty unbearable in November of 2019. I'm only just starting to feel better after working with my doctor trying to find a medicine that works for me and starting to work with a therapist again.

One of the ways depression hit me was that it made me want to isolate myself from my loved ones. I was not only ashamed of how I was feeling, but I was just really exhausted from pretending like everything was okay around other people. Basically, I stopped responding to calls and texts unless I needed to respond (like to coworkers). 

One of the people I isolated myself from was one of my best friends, whom I've known since college. I know that this is one of the people I should have felt comfortable talking to about my struggles. Her mother-in-law, however, has also struggled with depression. I've listened to my friend make comments about her MIL such as ""I wish she would just snap out of it,"" ""She is in control over her own mood, so it's her fault she feels this way,"" and ""I just don't understand depression. People should just get over it."" It's made it very difficult for me to be able to open up to her about what I'm going through. 

So I stopped responding to calls, texts, etc. and obviously she has stopped reaching out to me. I don't blame her. Now that I'm starting to feel some slight relief in my symptoms, I'm wanting to reach out to her again. I feel really bad that I can't bring myself to do it. It's been over a year since we've talked. I feel embarrassed, and I feel like it warrants an explanation. I feel extremely bad about it now, because she recently announced that she is pregnant (I found out through Facebook). She was having a really hard time getting pregnant and she's always wanted a baby, so this is REALLY important to her. I recently got an invitation to the baby shower (I think that might be too much for me) but I do want to reach out and congratulate her and maybe connect in person but one-on-one, but I feel stuck. Thanks to anyone who read this far. Has anyone else experienced something similar or have any advice for me?

TL;DR: I became extremely depressed, isolated myself from everyone including my best friend who has made disparaging comments about depression, but not I want to reconnect but am feeling too embarrassed and stuck to do so. Halp."
depression,2020/02/28,"Hate myself and feel like I don’t deserve love (22F) I’ve never been in a relationship, still a virgin &amp; only kissed a couple of guys. I believe I am a nice person, and have a pretty good personality. From about 14/15 to now (22) I have experienced mild to severe depression and anxiety. This has always prevented me from dating because I was always to anxious to meet or associate with guys, let alone go on a date with them. During my teenage years I was also always a little bit over average weight. Nothing too over the top but I always believed when I was fat (now I wish I could go back to my ‘fat’ 15 year old self lol). This past 2 years I have gained a lot of weight. I have tried to exercise and eat healthy but it has never stuck. I am severely unmotivated because I’m depressed , I would rather sleep or watch netflix than go to the gym. How do you actually make yourself motivated if you’re depressed and don’t want to get out of bed? I have been this way for as long as I can remember. These last few months I have become increasingly self conscious about my weight and body, now I am embarrassed about it. I never was embarrassed about it before, I was always unhappy with it, but never embarrassed. Now I am embarrassed to be seen in public because I feel like my body is disgusting and I can’t explain how much I hate seeing my body in a mirror.

depression,2020/02/28,"My rant (Long post) I (17F) need to rant a bit because I can't really say the things I'm about to say to anyone else in my life. lol

Go back 2 years ago from today and everything was mostly fine. I had great friends, a loving partner, and a family that I thought truly cared for me.

In March of 2018, my boyfriend and I broke up due to trust issues. A month later, one of my friends moves far away due to issues in her family. I haven't heard from her since. In May of 2018, all hell broke loose. My friends started to fight and argue with each other constantly, and I was basically the ""bridge"" between them. My family started to turn against me, yelling at me for not doing anything useful with myself. My anxiety shot through the roof and I started getting sick (extreme weight loss, hair loss, fatigue, etc.). I think this might have been the cause. I just know that nothing was the same after that month.

Weak ties with my family members. Two friends out of my life. Eventually, my ex-boyfriend and I had a talk, and we ended our connection on a good note.. But he and his family moved out of the city, and we never talked again. Meanwhile, my remaining friends are still fighting. That shit builds up emotionally.

Skip to November of 2018. I started dating one of my close friends who was (unfortunately) one of the main sources of drama at the time. He convinced me to cut ties with my female best friend, who may or may not have only kept me around for her benefit. I didn't want to do it, but I could barely even think clearly.. I was physically and mentally sick from my constant anxiety. I had broken most of my social connections in just one year and I felt like a piece of shit every day.

Fortunately, I'm doing a lot better now. I'm no longer physically sick, and I'm rarely anxious anymore. But damn, I still feel horrible at the end of each day. Here are some reasons why:

\- I think I might be bipolar (I'm angry for 5 days, then an emotional ""high"" for 3-4 days, repeated)

\- My family hates my boyfriend and they don't want me talking to him because they don't trust him at all (we're also long distance atm)

\- I'm angry over almost everything

\- I'm lonely

\- I hate myself and I don't have a job (or skills)

\- If I tell my family anything like this, they fucking mock me (I've tried, believe me)

I don't really like complaining but I just can't hold back anymore. If this keeps going on I'll just kill myself in the end. I have so much and yet I still hate life.

I could kill myself now and nobody would notice until 16 hours after. But I'm a coward, so.. lol"
depression,2020/02/28,"Feeling completely replaced &amp; is causing so much pain? Preface: my depression is already at the WORST it’s *ever* been this past month. This then happens and it crippled me. 

We were so close, for 3 years. He was the ONLY person I trusted and was close to. Last week we argued bc I got out of hospital and he (32M) didn’t visit me, instead talking to local girl (23F). I confronted him and he deleted her and said he wouldn’t even like her anyway because he doesn’t respect her job (online sex work).

He cut me off a few days later, ZERO EMOTION.. I went to drop my stuff off at him and he looked at me like I was a stranger, he walked off part way through the discussion about it and never spoke to me again. To me it’s unfinished conversation, to him it’s forgotten. 

Yes, he readded her, she blocked me, he blocked me, and he added the link to the same adult site she uses in his bio. (??) 

I’m devastated. It’s been 5 days and I sleep about 2-3 hours per night, cry excessively, and can barely eat a thing. I physically cannot face another week feeling THIS horrendous. My thoughts have got dark. On waiting list for NHS therapy, doctors know how low I am but can’t do much more than they are. 

I feel replaced and thrown away for new girl. Painful to know he probably is super taken with, as she very sexual like him, and thanks to my serious health issues I’ve been too sick to be sexual in a while :( he’s got his DREAM fantasy, and i’ve got my nightmare. 

Feel not good enough and like the loser here. I’m here inconsolable while they’re probably having a great time together, me not crossing his mind. I won’t even get closure let alone a apology. 

Just tell me how the hell to get over this. I can’t physically be sad about it for another second. I’m sick of crying. I’m in a lot of pain."
depression,2020/02/29,"Staring blankly ahead Hi!
So I (24F) have suffered from depression and anxiety (plus PTSS, but that has been well treated) since I was 15 years old. Recently I’ve been experiencing a (mild) relapse, but I realised that, when I’m getting worse, I just... tend to stare blankly ahead? So one moment I’m in the middle of a conversation, the next moment I realise that I’ve been staring ahead into nothing. This can be in combination with worrying and thinking, but sometimes I’m not thinking about anything and my mind just goes blank. I can kind of feel it in my eyes when it happens (I lose focus). Does anybody else experience this? Or maybe have an explanation about what it could be? I’m not sure if it’s useful to discuss with my psychologist..."
depression,2020/02/29,"My ex girlfriend is the only person I have right now. Me [25F] and my girlfriend [28F] broke up two weeks ago. It was all my fault. I was so insecure and I felt so lonely even with her. I hurt her so much for the last six months and we fight a lot. I was so selfish, I can't even think how she feels about my actions.

I'm in therapy for eight months and I figured out that my actions were a consequence of the bad relationship I've had with my parents.
 
Yesterday I talk with my ex and decided to cut ties and stop talking. I didn't feel anything after that. But today I talk  with my therapist about it and I feel extremely sad. I feel so guilty for everything and I hate myself because she doesn't deserve this at all.

I feel so bad right now and I try to talk with a friend but she doesn't understand me, so I decided to text my ex and she's coming to see me.

I don't know what to do, I feel extremely lonely right now."

But I started a few new medications for major depression and general anxiety disorder, and I don’t feel anything.  It’s crazy.  Las Vegas is AMAZING and the weather is BEAUTIFUL (at home it’s 10F right now).  My husband is getting frustrated with me.  We were going to go to the Belaggio water show last night with my husband and his brothers.  We left at 5 and by 7 we were still stuck in the casino (I don’t gamble, it makes me too nervous) and it was just so busy that I started feeling panicky and so nervous.  I went back to the hotel by myself.  Husband is still pissed at me.  They eventually got to the Belaggio at around 9pm.  

It’s so frustrating because I know I should feel happy, and I’m trying to.  But I can’t."

depression,2020/02/29,"Starting to feel hopeless again I feel like I'm failing at life and everything I try to do isn't worth it anymore. I'm 21F and dropped out of psych at uni, took a year break and switched to a different college &amp; completely new major- computer  science- thinking things would be ""different"" and I'd actually put in the work this time... but no. I'm still the same depressed person and absolutely nothing has changed that.

I can't even hold a job for a week because I'm so fucking anxious. I can't even hand a piece of paper to my prof because of the anxiety. I have absolutely no friends, I stay in my house 24/7 unless I'm at school. I feel like I'm not made for this world and I'm honestly not sure how long I can go on like this. 

I've wasted so much time and money at college. I wish I chose something else to study but I don't want to waste more years and I just don't know what to do. I started this program 2 months ago and I've been doing ""alright"" but I know it's going to get extremely hard in the coming semesters and I seriously doubt I'd be able to do it. I have absolutely no motivation to study and I'm miraculously scrapping by on the bare minimum at this point. 

I'm living with my dad &amp; I feel guilty that I can't get a job and I can't do things like a normal adult. I've never been diagnosed with anything or taken medication/therapy, I know that's the problem and I need help but it's just so difficult reaching out. Everything feels exhausting and pointless and I just want to disappear... I hate this so, so much... I feel like nothing matters because I'm going to die anyway.

 Was I made to withstand the world at all, or if it was inevitable. Other people survive so many terrible things with incredible resilience. I crumbled in the face of daily life I was already depressed and broken from a young age. I can't remember not feeling like the world is full of pain and horror and there's nothing I can do about it.

I have lost that light and with it most of myself. It is often painful to live with so much feeling all the time but it was who I was, it was a part of me that I have never had. I feel I will never be whole. And this is not the legacy I wanted to leave. I think back to my mother and I wish she had never said those words to me. I've been turning them over in my head for weeks. I didn't know why they hurt so much, but I think it's because I wish she had been right."
depression,2020/03/01,Depression and bad self esteem I’m a 32F in my first relationship with a man I love (28M) very much. My low self esteem and horrible self image are making myself and him crazy. I can’t seem to believe he loves me and is attracted to me despite numerous examples to the contrary. I also am much more emotional than even before. Does anyone in similar situations have any advice?
depression,2020/03/01,Am I depressed? (21F) So I feel like I may be depressed but I’m not sure. I’ve always had low self esteem and low confidence but recently it’s got a lot worse. I don’t have many friends and I feel so alone every day. I’m really shy and unconfident around people and always overthink my actions and worry what they think about me. I feel like I have to just get through the day and I don’t really find anything enjoyable. I can’t get to sleep and I feel really tired and lazy all the time. I struggle with basic self care and I don’t eat well. I’ve always been told I’m attractive so I feel like I base my self worth on that. I find it difficult to leave my house without makeup. If I feel like I look bad in public I feel really uncomfortable. I always compare myself to other girls. Instagram also seriously affects my mental health. I judge myself based on how many likes or comments I get and worry sooo much about whether people think I’m pretty. I’m always on my phone to try and distract myself from anxious and sad thoughts. Do you think I may be depressed?
depression,2020/03/01,"I’m scared I’m 27F and I feel like I’ve done nothing with my life. I’m tired of my job and want to move on but there isn’t anything around outside retail and food. I can’t support myself with my part time job so I still live at home. I hate it cause I’m constantly getting asked when I’m going to get a full time job or why don’t I go out more. Full time jobs in my area that are related to my college degree don’t exist. And going to do retail just gets me shit talked by my dad. (I did retail for months before my current job and it was months of him shit talking me about getting a real job.) Going out to hang with friends isn’t much of an option either. I only have 1 friend that stayed around (by which I mean stayed in town) after college and she’s busy with her own life. I don’t want to be that friend that clings to someone. 

I feel like 90% of my friends have moved on with their lives. Full time jobs, buying houses, getting engaged. Being happy. When some of them came back during the holidays I met with a group and it was nice, but I still felt so depressed. They all sound so happy with themselves. And I’m just not. Ever since meeting with them they are trying to invite me to their gatherings/travel plans and I just can’t afford it. And it just makes me feel small every time I have to turn them down. 

I’ve always dealt with depression since back in middle school. My anxiety came in college, but now I feel so exhausted. I feel like I’m not going anywhere. I graduated with a degree I wanted to change my junior year because I knew there would be no career path for me. My parents said just finish it and we’ll think about what to do after you graduate. 2 years later and my self hatred has grown. I feel no one arounds me understands my stress and low opinion I have of myself. I’ve tried talking about it with my parents and it’s just ‘you shouldn’t feel like that’ or ‘it sounds like you’re saying I’m a bad parent.’ The conversation always turns and suddenly I’m trying to console their parenting.  

I don’t talk with my friends about these feelings. Idk why I’m writing this. Maybe it’s suppose to be therapeutic? Idk. It’s just I want to put this out there. Cause today I had a scary thought. I’m not happy. I don’t remember the last time I was and if this keeps going the way it is I don’t think I’ll ever turn 30."

But I'm at the point where the pain involved seems less and less scary the more I think and that can't mean anything good. More and more often I just wish for that hypothetical switch to just instantly end it all because the stress of bring a mediocre artist in a world where I have to work harder than thousands of other more qualified people or I starve. I never have time to rest in art school and I feel like I'm getting closer to drowning every day. This is the only thing I'm even slightly good at or enjoy so if this fails I really WILL kill myself no questions asked. My only friends are states away or online and therapy isn't helpful. I feel so lost and alone and I keep spending money on frivolous things to keep the feeling of the void at bay, because having something, anything to look forward to, is otherwise hard to come by.

depression,2020/03/02,"Break through “I want to live” moment Some background:

I (20F) have been struggling with suicidal ideation on and off for the last several years. It began as very infrequent intrusive thoughts. I have been on antidepressants for two years now and they have helped tremendously. However, I stopped taking them (with no medical guidance) in May or June of 2019 and didn’t resume taking them daily until August. At that point, my suicidal thoughts were extensive. I never made a plan, but I would think/ fantasize about it constantly, sometimes all day. Now, I have extensive suicidal thoughts once or twice a month. I am seeing my psychiatrist regularly again. 

This weekend I was out with friends and did a lot of cocaine. I was genuinely afraid that I would die and I realized then how desperately I really wanted to live. It felt like a real break through. Now, I’m wondering if it will have any real impact. 

Can a “break through” like this actually subdue one’s suicidal ideation? Or are suicidal thoughts not rational enough for this to be very helpful?

What are your experiences with moments like these? Any and all insights are much appreciated."
depression,2020/03/02,"Absent father trauma is now kicking my ass (20F) My parents got divorced in 2012, then it did not affect me that much because they were always fighting and it was nice to have peace and quiet. Now I’ll listen to old songs that I grew up listening to with my parents just to maybe feel like everything is okay? In relationships I have no trust and I’m constantly anxious that the other person is doing something bad to me. I tried to get into contact with my dad this past fall and we talked a little bit I even offered to cook for him so he can come over and see me. He was never really present in my life after the divorce, he would take me on holidays and that was it. So now that I was inviting him he would get off of the phone and be like “I’ll call you right back!” Never called. I’m so deeply wounded. How do you get through the trauma of not feeling wanted? I feel so depressed all of the time I’m so happy I have my cat otherwise I wouldn’t be here writing this post. It sucks so bad to have never experienced that fatherly love."

If ever I’m with friends, there has to be drinking involved. Otherwise, I’m quiet, antisocial, and a pain to be around. 

My psychologist talked to me about going on antidepressants, but I don’t have insurance and wouldn’t be able to afford it. 

Any advice?"
depression,2020/03/03,"I'm in a hole, or maybe I am the hole This is my first ever post on reddit, so apologies if I break any rules or conventions by mistake. I (22F) have been dealing with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. My parents were shitty and abusive, and I have 3 siblings who, while I love them dearly, have almost always treated me like the Meg Griffin of the family, probably unknowingly following my parents' example. (None of them would ever admit this, though; they're all ""proud"" of me for being the first and only to graduate college despite not actually caring to know who I am as a person) I developed self esteem issues at a really young age because of this. Still, I've spent the past decade trying to build myself up and hanging on to hope things will get better. Mentally, I was actually OK up until last summer ended. 
I got the opportunity to start working as a teacher, something I've always wanted to do. I loved my job, I loved the kids, and it turns out I also love math. The problem was that I was new, didn't study education, had no experience or training and was then basically pushed in the deep end, teaching math to every student in the school. The workload was massive and I was crumbling. I held on as long as I could not only because I didn't want to accept failure, but for the reasons mentioned above. I loved my job but it was breaking me. I had no time to myself, and barely enough time to sleep. It put strain on my relationship because I was too stressed and anxious to just be myself, even on the weekends, cause I had to spend that free time preparing for the week ahead and grasping old work.  I was dissociating a lot. I remember one time I saw myself in the mirror and was surprised because I literally forgot who I was.  Nobody called me by my first name anymore. I barely had time to shower every day or make myself pretty. In fact, I had to actively try to make myself LESS attractive because my students were too horny.
I started using blow because it made me feel like I could Do The Things, and I could, finally, without feeling like an empty husk. But after a couple months I felt that it was inevitably going to get out of hand, so I had to stop. And that made doing the things even harder. And then the workload increased yet again. The day I quit, I couldn't even get out of bed how anxious and just weak I felt. I still feel like a failure for not making it to June and probably will for the rest of my life. 
My best friend (~8 years) hasn't spoken to me since I quit. She also hadn't really spoken to me much before then either. She would say she'd be there for me but wouldn't return my texts,  or, when I tried to actually find her and talk in person, she'd always be busy with someone else. I thought we were going to grow old together. Stupid, I know. 
My family isn't all too pleased with me either, since over the past year I've put my foot down on how I will and won't accept being treated. I'm completely alone aside from my SO. I'm trying not to put the whole weight of everything on him because even if he didn't have his own anxiety to deal with, it just wouldn't be fair. But I'm drowning. I'm trying to find a therapist asap because I feel like I've lost so much progress from over the last few years and the intrusive/ self harm thoughts are starting to control me again. 
The truth is, the one thing keeping me from killing myself all these years has been a dream of the family I'll someday have. I want kids more than anything in this world, but now I feel I don't deserve them and probably never will. So much for that dream. 
I don't know what's my goal here. To feel less alone? Maybe some tips on how to find an OK therapist with shitty insurance and no money? I'm a woman of color and desperately fearful of opening up to someone who's just going to gaslight me. I've been gaslit my whole life, I just can't take it from someone who's supposed to help and I feel it would discourage me from going to therapy at all."
depression,2020/03/04,"Boyfriend (30M) ended things with me (27F) due to depressive episode? Had no idea he dealt with depression New to reddit, I hope I’m ok to post here and not breaking any rules

My boyfriend of 2 years and I have had an overall happy relationship. We had one breakup last summer for a month or so due to him being unable to communicate well, but since getting back together things have been great. We saw each other last week and everything was normal, we made plans to spend Saturday together.  

Saturday, I texted him twice during the day and got no reply. By 9pm, I was pretty annoyed and over reacted a bit, I sent 3 texts asking what was going on/expressing frustration that we were dealing with the same lack of communication as before. Sunday morning, he responds saying “clearly this isn’t working” and tells me that he was struggling with a depressive episode Saturday and was unable to even find the energy to text me. 

I feel horrible, he has never indicated to me that this was a struggle he dealt with. He’s told me before sometimes he gets into “funks” but never anything like this. If I knew, I would have definitely backed off. He accused me of always making him feel guilty. I asked him to please not make the decision to end our relationship based on a misunderstanding, as I can only react to the information I had, and to please tell me if he wants to be with me, and that I will give him the space he wants/needs to recover. He never responded to that message, so I assume we are broken up. I have not tried to contact him since. (This is probably silly to add, but he has also been avoiding all of my social media stories, which is out of character for him.)

I have never dealt with depression, so I’m not sure what protocol is here. I guess I’m just looking for how I can reach out (if I should), let him know I’m here for him, or get him to understand that I would never want to pressure him or negatively affect his mental health. I’m blindsided because a week ago we were talking about our future, and now he is acting like I don’t exist. 

TL;DR I over reacted to my BF not responding to my texts when we had plans, he tells me he was dealing with a depressive episode and that I was guilting him and ended things. I’m blindsided and desperate to fix this."

depression,2020/03/07,"Anti-depressants have ruined so many good things for me (24M) I don't rant very often, but I'd like to share my personal experience regarding what anti-depressants have done to me as an individual.

I began taking Lexapro in 2018 because I had symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts. It took a long time for the medication to work, but unfortunately it caused me terrible stomach problems. My anxiety has been terrible since I was a kid. I needed to figure it out. So late last November I switched to Prozac.

Worst idea of my life.

I started dating this wonderful girl who was independent and sweet and empathetic with me, which helped me sometimes feel like I could fight my mental health problems, but when the medication started ramping up in December, I started throwing and breaking things, and eventually we got into physical altercations. 

I have NEVER in my life been in a fight with another human being. I'm a small guy, I don't like confrontation, and I don't appreciate when people are irrationally violent.

Well, Prozac made me absolutely *violent.* It is still coming out of my system and I can feel it lessening everyday, but I still can't seem to hold down the  rage. I can't stop myself from having knee-jerk reactions to even little things like what I hear or what people say to me.

I am in so much pain because this medication isn't helping me control *anything* like my doctor promised. I'm going to start therapy in hopes to curb this, but I haven't had these issues since I was ten or eleven years old. 

Back in September I was happy, but anxious, and sometimes fell into depression, but I got out of it. I don't want to try anymore medication. I was perfectly fine just taking the hits and dealing with it on my own, but Prozac made me feel like I had no control. I still sometimes feel like I don't.

Props to my girlfriend (27F), for she hasn't left me while I struggle with this, but I'm feeling like an outcast too. I've slept on the couch for two weeks as punishment from her. I tell her how I feel and she says ""I wonder why"" and then tells me to prove I can be different. I just want this bullshit to stop! I'm so done feeling like this. I want the pain to stop and I just want to be me again."
depression,2020/03/08,"Do I have depression? What should I do? [18F] I’ve been feeling very restless since i was 16, which gradually got worse in the last 2 years. I know that I enjoy studying and I do have many other goals I want to achieve (such as exercising regularly), but I can’t seem to translate them into actions. 

I suspect it started due to a burn out. When I was 13-15, I did well in my exams and it felt good so I really enjoyed studying. Hence, all I did was to study all day. Approaching a major exam, I think I started to burn out and I sometimes just laid on my bed and used my phone when I should have been studying.

This went out of control when I entered high school. There was a steep learning curve, and everyone around me were smarter than me. Studying became less enjoyable, and my tendencies to stay in bed all day doing nothing became stronger than ever. Looking back, those were really hard times, my mind was literally telling me to study but my body wouldn’t budge an inch. 

I thought that it would be over after I have finished my exams, but unfortunately not. At first, I tried very hard to get out of this situation. I worked hard to find a job during my break, and started journaling. However, such progress was only short-lived. Even though I managed to get a temporary job, everyday when I reached home and on weekends, I was one with my bed. Now that I’ve received my results, I’m even procrastinating with my uni applications. 

My parents were very strict and controlled my life for the first 13 years, so i don’t think i was given the chance to develop my self-discipline. 

I’m not sure if I have issues with my self-discipline or if i have any mental illnesses. I have many goals for myself, which I have written and typed so many times in an attempt to kick start my momentum, but they never materialise. I am normal at work (except maybe a little lack of self-confidence), but off work I literally do nothing useful. 

Can someone help me analyse my situation and also provide tips on how I should proceed from here? I would really appreciate any help, thank you!"
depression,2020/03/08,"need advice 22F. I don't know if what I am feeling is normal, or if I really should be looking for help. For the past 5 or so years I believe I've been struggling with depression. This past summer was probably the worst it has ever been, but I am currently doing okay. I don't know if I am depressed because I can work/ hang out with friends and I do enjoy some parts of life.  I have a part-time job that I do that pays well enough to cover rent/expenses. I don't love it there, and that is another side issue but I haven't been low enough that I can't get up and go to work when I need to. However I know that there are times when I just can't cope with the struggles of life. I have self-harmed on and off for the past five years, not enough to leave permanent or noticeable damage but it is something I am so ashamed of that I have never told a soul, and I don't think anyone notices. More recently I go through periods of starving myself, or eating a lot less than I should be. I am a normal weight and don't believe its an ED, but it is something that I will do on purpose when I am depressed/ feeling low. Over the summer I lived alone and there was a time where I attempted to OD..I don't know what I was really thinking I just knew I wouldn't have been mad if I didn't wake up in the morning. There are some issues with my family that causes a lot of stress, although this is more recent (aka past two years). I don't really know what I am asking, maybe just for some advice. I get really socially anxious and the idea of asking for help is the last thing I want to do, but I can't live my life like this. I tried betterhelp a while back but I didn't feel as though it help, but I may have gave up too quick. I live in Ontario which means eventually I will have access to free therapy, but I don't know if I can hold out until then."
depression,2020/03/09,"How do I make sense of what happened I am 22F now, but when I was in highschool I was in a 2 year relationship with a girl who emotionally abused me and gaslighted me to the point of myself attempting suicide multiple times. Im not one to get triggered but hearing her name in passing sends me into a spiral. The topic recently came up with my longtime boyfriend as I had been pushing it away for years avoiding the topic. I don’t know how to explain the situation without sounding crazy, because it does sound crazy, why would I date someone I actively hated for 2 years? Why wouldn’t I just leave when I realized I was being abused? I DONT KNOW. Its because I was being manipulated and threatened that if I left I would be responsible for her suicide. Its because I was tricked into alienating all my friends so if left I would have nobody left. Its because when I was still in the hospital after overdosing she continued to tell me how I was selfish I was being. Its how she told everyone I attempted and then blamed my best friend for the reason the whole student body knew I was gone. My closest friend who witnessed it all real time is the only one in the world that truly understands as well as I do what happened and I know she knows why this happened but I don’t know how to express the pain to anyone else without sounding like an idiot. I don’t even know how to explain to myself what happened and if it was all my fault after all?"
depression,2020/03/10,"I ruined it  **Forewarning, I have ZERO relationship experience, I made this clear to her in advance, but I cant help but think that I did or said something that caused the wrong idea.**

I \[28M\] met the **most amazing woman of the face of the Earth \[18F\] about two months ago. She is super sweet, kind, smart, funny, drop-dead gorgeous, and a dream to spend time with.** We originally met just to hookup, however we connected and she became an amazing friend. **By far the best thing to ever happen to me in my entire life**, no question. We weren't bf/gf, **we were us**, no labels. We hung out, went on dates, explored the city, and generally just spent time together, and it was so fun and felt so good. Age gap is a thing, I understand, I wasn't expecting a relationship or anything, but if it turned to that I wouldn't say I'd be adverse. We had talked before about the age gap and she said that it wasn't really a problem. Anyway, the other day I received a text from her that she thinks we shouldn't see each other anymore, that things were going too fast and she wasn't comfortable or ready for it. Two hours before this she responded to a cute meme I sent her that was a ""cuddle coupon"" and she said she would be using it a lot. How it goes complete 180 turn in such a short time, **FUCK MY LIFE**. Frankly I'm devastated, I never intended to rush anything, in fact I was more than content being friends. I can't help but feel that I did something or said something that ruined it, and **I hate myself for causing the end of the best thing that has ever happened to me**. I feel like I was being toxic or asking for too much without realizing it. I am in so much pain. Now I am planning on improving myself, mainly to try and numb the pain, also hoping that our paths cross once again. **I place no blame on her, if she thinks its over, then I guess its over**, I respect her feelings. But god I feel so bad and miss her so much, **I'm afraid to sleep at night because I dream about her and feel even worse**. I cant focus on work, or family or anything, I've basically been crying nonstop. I feel like such a baby and such a burden. ""Why would she want to hang out with me anyway?"" I think to myself. Its so fucking painful. **I was truly, genuinely, happy for once in my life and now its over.** I fucking ruined it.  **I would do anything to be friends with her once again.** Her birthday is coming up and I think I'm gonna send her a card, which is probably the stupidest fucking thing imaginable, but I want to do it anyway. Well yeah, I kinda just wanted to vent, but I'm interested to hear about what yall think too.

Thanks for reading, lots of love- Voodoo"
depression,2020/03/10,"My (34M) wife (33F) just moved out. Depressed and pushing me away? My wife has been struggling to find happiness for over  a year now. She couldn’t decide if she was unhappy because of us or just unhappy in general. It has been a year of her putting extremely limited effort into the relationship and then pulling back once things seem to be improving. Does this sound like depression taking over or should I just let her go and start over?

Interesting note: she started taking cymbalta/duloxetine this past weekend. I’ve read that this will take 6-8 weeks to begin really helping with her views of the world. Am I silly to think it will change her view of us?

We went to counseling last February and she told the therapist she never loved me and pretty much forced our entire relationship. I know she loved at one point, but her views are so jaded now. 

Appreciate some feedback with others that have experienced similar!"
depression,2020/03/10,"Just some thoughts First: I'd like to apologise for any mistakes, English is not my first language.  
Second: First time posting.  
It's really hard for me to talk about my feelings and problems with relatives and friends, so here I am (if it's the wrong place please let me know)  


Lately it's getting harder for me to go through the days, I keep feeling useless, lost, sad and lonely. I have people around me who says ""You're not alone"" or ""You can count on me"" but people who don't have depression never really get what it is like, so I end up never sharing (most because I'm afraid to just put this weight on them).  
I'm out of energy to do basically anything and for me it's easier to pretend everything is fine but these days I'm not getting enough sleep, wake in the middle of the night crying... I feel that the older I get (27F) the harder it is to live.  
I don't have suicidal thoughts, but I'd really like to cease existing.  


(I'd like to thank you guys for being able to have this 'place' where I can read your feeling and express mine)"
depression,2020/03/10,"A glimpse into my existence, notice I don’t say life.. because I’m not living. I’m a (25F) who has been battling depression for as long as I can remember. Only did I get professional help within the past year. I see a therapist twice a week and a psychiatrist once a month. For a whole year now. I can honestly say I’m only getting worse. Especially within the past 3 years. I’ve tried all the grounding techniques and breathing exercises, and 7 types of medications. Nothing is working and I’m only putting more and more financial strain on my dad. He supports me financially when it comes to medical bills, and oh do I feel so guilty about that. He is the only parent who works due to my mom having a heart condition. As you guessed i still live under their roof because I can’t hold a job long enough to support myself. I was clinically diagnosed with depression and GAD, and I’m sure that’s just the tip of it. I don’t understand my emotions and due to the depression causing memory loss and brain fog that doesn’t allow me to comprehend or configure sentences to express my issues to my doctors. I have nothing to my name. No car, no job, no nothing. I have a loving boyfriend of 6 years who has supported me as much as he can throughout all of this. A lot of the times he doesn’t know what to do or say, and I remind him I don’t blame him. Nothing in this world could make me feel any differently. Everyday I wake up I sigh, here we go again. I sleep majority of the days away. I’m talking 15-
18 hours I’m asleep. I can only stay awake for up to 3 hours max before dozing off needing a nap. My mind runs constantly about this and that and all of the above to the point I exhaust myself. There is nothing more I want at this point than to not be alive. I just don’t want to do it anymore. I pray for death. I pray every-time I leave my house I die in a car accident, a stray bullet, a fire, anything. I get jealous when I hear on the news someone has passed. I wish it were me. Now there is this new coronavirus spreading and everyone is freaking out, sweeping stores of canned goods, water and necessities. While I pray I come in contact with someone who is infected. I have a very loving family. Two loving parents, an older sister (who pushed me to address my mental health) and a younger brother who has a big heart. I could never commit suicide, because we’re all that we have. No other family ties. We all live together, and always have so were very very close. I think about it every day though. Hanging myself from the tree out back. Taking every single pill I have and can find through out the house. Feeding a tube from the exhaust pipe of the car through my window into my closet with me in it. Driving into oncoming traffic. Hell, I even saw in a movie a guy wrapped a rope around his neck, through his back window of the car and around a tree and hit the gas. I’ve thought about blowing my brains out. But all of this is gruesome and would mentally fuck anyone who heard their loved one passed in such a way. I can’t do that to them. But how is that fair to me, that I live such a miserable life just for the sake of those around me? I juggle those two.. do I finally do something that I want, or keep pleasing those around me? My parents know I have depression and anxiety but who really knows what that means unless you are going through it. I know they don’t understand and are uncomfortable with the thought of it so it’s just an “here is the money for your thing” type thing. I never really have gone into detail about any of this because I don’t want them to think they failed me. I had a very good childhood. No incidences. I was a very anxious kid but because of that it pushed me to do what I was told and get good grades. I always wonder why I have depression and anxiety. I was never molested, abused, or bullied more than the average kid. I haven’t gone through anything traumatic, or anything more than the average heartbreak from a high-school sweetheart. I do have to admit, he did abused me, emotionally, mentally, verbally, and somewhat physically. But I’ve felt this way even before him. I could go on and on about my involuntary existence, but the real reason I’m typing this right now is because I had to do something to get my mind off taking all of my pills at once. Yesterday I poured them all in my cupped hands and it looked like enough to do the job, and since then, I cannot get that picture out of my head. I do think I should admit myself into a mental institution, but you know what that means.. more money from dad.. way way way more money. And I just can’t take from him anymore. He has the rest of us to support. So what’ll I’ll do tonight? I’ll try to sleep.. wake up and sigh, rinse, and repeat. If you’ve made it this far, I appreciate that. Because no one. And I mean no one, has gotten this much raw emotion from me. Hell, I might just share this with my loved ones to give an insight of how far from ok I really am. Because I’m very good at faking that I am."
depression,2020/03/10,"advice on how to stop numbing emotions? 17F: kinda wondering if I’ve developed BED. I’ve had an unhealthy relationship with food for years but it’s become this now. it’s gotten to the point where I feel like I just need something to numb everything. right now it’s food. otherwise alcohol, drugs, or something else.

1. how do I stop using things that numb my emotions and live a normal healthy life?
2. how do I WANT to stop using/eating the emotion-numbing things
3. what do I replace the emotion-numbing want with?

also I’m on antidepressants (will up) and am trying to figure out counseling. I know I want to be free of this but at the same time I want to keep my pattern of sleeping and video games and hiding from life"
depression,2020/03/11,"Depression due to Death I’m (20F) currently going through a few family deaths and it is dragging me back to a depressive state I worked hard to avoid. I can’t out run it. I drink water, I work out, I mostly eat right, I keep myself occupied by seeing friends, and all that stuff that is suppose to help. But it is starting to become less effective and I can’t enjoy those things anymore, and when I do it is such a temporary feeling. 
I just lost my great grandmother, I worked through that easier because she was elderly and had been fighting dementia for quite a while. She’s in a better place. However my grandpa who once he got on retirement found out he had stage four lung cancer and had less than a year to live. He beat that odd and through treatment the cancer went away! We were a miracle family and I felt relief. Weeks later we get told it spread to his spine and there is no treatment options anymore. He’s going to die before Spring most likely. I can see the life fading from him and I don’t know what to do. I visit when I can and bring his favorite chocolate chip cookies. When I see him I can put on a brave face but during the week and after I just am falling apart. I’m crying myself to sleep every night and the second I get home from work I cry on and off. I feel like such a burden to the people around me because I have nothing but sadness to give. I want to go to therapy but I cannot find a therapist who works weekends. I work and go to school all day during the week. I’m falling apart and I’m afraid to go off the deep end because this time isn’t about me. It is suppose to be about my grandpa. All I can think about it death. All I can think about is how my family is going to lose someone so important to all of us. My grandma will lose her partner. All I can think to do is push people away to shield them from the emotional bomb I am. On top of all this my great uncle is teetering in the edge of death himself. I feel like anywhere I turn someone is going to be dying. 
I can’t sleep right anymore and I’m starting to decay in school. I don’t know what to do I don’t know when I’ll feel myself again."
depression,2020/03/12,"My BF [32M] has severe depression and I [26F] don't know how to help. Suggestions? My BF has rarely been open with me about his depression until it comes out during a fight (usually as an explanation for his behavior when I didn't realize that's what was going on). I hate that I don't know how to deal with it. 

He typically spirals and can spend days, weeks, or months on a downward path of not getting anything done and being extremely sensitive or irritated.

I have tried to ask him/talk to him about it but he doesn't want to. I usually get mildly upset if he snaps at me and don't have the patience that I would like for handling his bad moods. 

How do your spouses support you in a positive way? What can I do that won't make it worse or push him away? I'm not the best at taking car office people but I'm trying to learn.

TL;DR My BF struggles with depression and I need suggestions for how to handle it and support him."
depression,2020/03/13,"I can feel happiness? I (22F) have spent the last 8 years of my life with intense depression. I never thought I had real depression though, just a series of bad days (the series lasted YEARS and I still didn't think it was REAL depression???). 

Eventually I tried to end it. It didn't work, so I tried harder 2 weeks later. I landed in the ICU for 3 days and a psych ward for a week. I was pissed. They made me start on meds and go to therapy 8 hours every day. When I got out, I spent the next 3 weeks with my family, so I couldn't try anything because everyone was watching me like a hawk. But over that month of being on meds, I gradually wanted to die less and less. I was still pretty unhappy, but not suicidal. 

I got up the courage, thanks to my husband, to go to a doctor and ask if there was anything else I could do to feel happy instead of just not suicidal. She prescribed two other meds, so now I take 3. They worked.

Now, I'm not just not suicidal, I'm consistently happy. It's something I haven't felt in 8 years. Every time I feel that joy a tear or 3 roll down my cheek because I spent the last 8 years miserable, when $20/mo of prescriptions would have changed that. I'm crying now typing this out. 

Now, when I face challenges, I want to figure out a way to overcome them instead of figuring out the most painless/clean way to die. I can genuinely smile again?? I want to keep the commitments I made to my friends? It's honestly kind of bewildering. 

I'm a little scared of happiness after these years, but it feels so good. The people around me seem more friendly because I'M more friendly. I thought it was just a bad day all this time when it was literally a chemical problem. It wasn't my fault, it wasn't some kind of moral failure. The meds worked, they fixed the chemical problem. 

I don't have a message here, except maybe try meds &amp; therapy if you're hesitant? I'm not trying to be preachy, I'm just overwhelmed. 

Please hang in there guys. You are worth it. You deserve it."
depression,2020/03/14,"Struggling student, grief, and now I can’t the help I need because my university health/counseling center is closed. Hi, all. So, in case you couldn’t tell, I’m struggling. A lot. (21F)

So, this semester has been rough. I’m failing and doing poorly in my classes, which I normally don’t do. I’m incredibly upset and disappointed in myself because I’m set to graduate in the fall, and I’m worried that I won’t be able to. I just don’t want to be a disappointment.

While I’m doing better today, I’ve had a rough time grieving the loss of a prominent figure in my life to suicide. It’s made me quite sad, and I can’t seem to stop thinking about it.

I went to my university’s nursing center, and we had an appointment scheduled today to discuss medication options and counseling options for severe depression/anxiety symptoms. Our campus closed due to the virus pandemic, so I can’t get the help I need. I’m too worried to seek help when I get home - my mom has typically tried to keep me from medicine for mental health because she thinks I don’t need it. I’m just really struggling, and the thought of having to go home and pretend like I’m doing great in school and emotionally is so stressful. I also plan on staying with my fiancé this upcoming week. I’m so ready to see him, but I also don’t want to be a downer the whole time I’m with him.

I guess everything in the world is just overwhelming. I’m also a music major, and my senior voice recital that was scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled, in addition to my other choir performances and music fraternity events, and it’s been quite a shock to my system. I hate that my mental state has made me struggle to enjoy making music, and now I’m sad to know that I may not get to perform with my ensembles for the rest of the semester, and I’m not sure if I’ll be able to have a recital. My birthday is Tuesday too, and I feel like I won’t even be able to enjoy it.

I’m sorry if this was a lot, or if it seems like I’m being negative over small things. Thank you for reading if you’ve made it this far."
depression,2020/03/15,"I (29F) am a crying babbling mess. Life does not seem to be getting any better. This time last year my (29F) life was so different. Although I was 30lbs heavier than I am now &amp; really anxious about my job, I was doing well there/in my career, made good money, was headed on vacation to the beach, in a couple of weeks and started hanging out with someone who (I thought) liked me. 

Fast forward to now: I was fired from that job, then I got another job which I was laid off from in December because they got rid of my whole department (still looking for work), still have never had a serious relationship or someone that just wanted to be with me and wasn’t shy about it and had no ulterior motives, and I am beyond sad and cry every day. I’m crying writing this. I want to feel better, to stop comparing my life to others and not constantly hate myself and feel so fucking lonely that I go on apps to talk to people just to make the day go by, but I can’t. It frustrates me and I feel so dumb. 
Dating: it has been so awful for me. I know that having a partner won’t bring me the happiness I need on my own, I need to focus on myself, my time will come, but I HATE HATE HATE hearing that shit. I have been focusing on myself for the last 29.25 years, and I think there is nothing wrong with wanting to date and have a partner to share my life with. And I also hate when someone says but you’re so pretty smart and kind and alluring, you’ll find someone! You don’t know that!!!!!!

I have been noticeably different towards my friends. I decided to open up to one of them and now that I have, I really wish I had just gone with the “I’m fine” response. She is trying to help and I know that I am difficult to even have a conversation with right now. She said if I needed distance then she would give it, but it feels selfish to do that, so I continue to say it’s fine to continue talking. But it hurts to hear about hers (or the other people in my life) increase in pay at her job, her new guy she is seeing, how her life is going so well, when mine is utter and complete shit. And all I can do is compare and it leads to more crying. She says she wants to help me get out of the funk I’m in and that I have every right to feel how I feel but I need to be more positive. I love her and thank her for want to help, but I hate hearing that. Which then leads me back to thinking maybe I should just distance myself. We’ve argued a bit lately. And I know it’s because of me. I’ve become too attached (we talk throughout the day, every day) &amp; I get more anxious when I don’t hear from her. I tried being vulnerable this afternoon and I still haven’t heard from her. But I am resisting sending another text. I absolutely hate how much things like this I s affect my happiness. I wish I wasn’t such a shit person and friend. 

People always suggest gym and eating better as ways to cope. Well the thing is is that I already go to the gym 6 times a week (sometimes daily). There around 90 min to 2 hours. During that time is the only time I am confident, happy, and determined in myself. I feel strong, capable, and on top of the world. But as soon as I leave, it’s back to shit. But if I did not have the gym, I do not know how even darker and more depressed I would feel. Also (I live at home with my parents and sister right now) I haven’t eaten more than one small meal a day really in the past 4 days. I’ve been able to hide it from them. Not that I am trying to starve myself, but when I get really sad nowadays it I think I disappoint my friend or my family, I don’t eat.  

Due to not working and not really having money, I don’t go anywhere. Which leads to minimal social interaction. I did not realize that it would affect me so much. But it really has. On the off chance I talk to someone at the gym, that makes my week because that is usually the only interaction I get. I go to my favorite local bar every so often and it helps just to be somewhere different. But I feel guilty spending a little money on two drinks and to socialize.

I do the the things that they say most people who are depressed usually don’t do: I clean, make meals for myself, shower daily, go to the gym. So then I think to myself,”maybe I’m not depressed? Maybe I’m making this up and it isn’t legitimate. 
And job: I’ve applied, but honestly I have been hesitant to apply to a lot of jobs because I just don’t feel smart enough or capable enough at all. I have colleagues in my field who say I am young, smart and capable. But it doesn’t feel that way given my recent job history. 


How are you? My honest answer for the last 3 1/2 months: I am tired I am lonely and I’m stupid and I hate myself."
depression,2020/03/16,"Birthdays suck 22F here, been suffering with depression for almost two years now. I've noticed that over the past few years, when my birthday comes around, I feel quite down and not at all like a celebration. If it were up to me, I probably wouldn't celebrate at all, but my parents are very big on the family topic and they always want to gather for such things. I don't want to be forced to sit at a table with some family, making awkward small talk and having them take pictures of me holding the stupid cake. How do I tell my family that I'd rather be alone on my birthday, because it's making me sad rather than the other way around?"
depression,2020/03/16,"Getting sick of trying Excuse the shitty grammer, I don't care enough to try harder.

'm 22F.  Diagnosed anxiety, social anxiety, major depressive disorder, the shabang. Cant afford a counsellor and the public service is useless (been through 3 psychiatrists) 

Recently I seem to be having more bad days than good. I think it's the anxiety that triggers the depression.

Had to quit my job late last year cause of the anxiety. Can't seem to force myself to get another one. Don't want to. See no point in it.

I used to self harm, thoughts have come back to do it again but I'm pushing against them.

Don't see a point in living, I'm not working, I failed college, I'm a waste of space. A useless 22 year old living with my parents (who are starting to get real tired of my constant state of shit mental health).

Boyfriend is great and supportive. Him and my family are the only things making me not want to end everything. They're the only reason I haven't and the only reason I'm not going to. Wish I could change that. There should be more reasons I don't want to die.

Really bad tonight (it's 1am).  Took medication to calm me down, typing this waiting for it to work."
depression,2020/03/16,"What am I doing? Quick note, I made this throwaway to write this, that’s why I don’t have any karma. There are also many mentions of self harm in here.

I don’t know what I’m doing anymore.

I’m 13F and I’ve been happy my whole life. My parents are great people, I love my brother with all my heart, I have amazing friends who support me every day.

Yet somehow, for some reason completely beyond me, I feel so alone. Yes, I have my friends outside of my school, but I look around and see all these people at school who seem to know and want to talk to everyone but me. I go to school for 7 hours every day and it’s 7 hours of hell. 5 out of 7 days a week. I want people to talk to me. I wish people would just notice me for once. Every morning I have no motivation to wake up and get through the day. It’s made me stop doing my schoolwork among other things.

A few weeks ago, I thought about cutting myself. I don’t know why, but it seemed like such a good idea at the time. I just thought it would fix everything. So I tried. I took a pair of scissors to my wrist. They weren’t sharp enough. So the feeling went away. I told my friend. She didn’t know how to react. I told my mom. She freaked out and told my dad. He freaked out and told my brother. They all freaked out and told my therapist.

Therapy has been helping, but I still get so many urges to cut. It started off as a suggestion my brain was making, but now it feels like I have to. I have to cut my pain away. It feels like the only way to stop the emotional pain I’m feeling is to cut it out. My brain keeps telling me I have to, I have to cut, I have to cut my pain away. I have some friends on speed dial who are always happy to help when I freak out like that, but the urges get stronger every time. The last time I tried was with an earring, and for some reason my brain was telling me it was a terrible idea to call my friend, that I would just be a burden to them. Thankfully I resisted the urge.

It’s gotten to the point where every time I touch anything remotely sharp, I can only think about cutting. I don’t have anything sharp in my room. My parents insist on cutting my food for me.

Someone, anyone, please tell me. What the hell am I doing and how do I stop? I so badly want to,  but I just can’t. This temptation scares me, yet it seems like it’s my only option. I’m so terrified it’s gonna get so bad that I’ll start cutting for real, and then one day I’ll cut my entire life away."
depression,2020/03/18,"Depression is hurting my ability to love For the past few weeks I (22M) been feeling guilty/sad around my girlfriend (19F). She is the most amazing, funny, compassionate, and loving woman I’ve ever had in my life and I love her so much. But recently I’ve gotten thoughts in my head that I’m not good enough for her and that she deserves better, and I feel like I have to let her go. Just days ago we went out to a party and everything was good, we held hands, kissed, joked and laughed like we normally do. The constant reassurance, love, support, and affection she gives me in light of my feelings makes me feel even more guilty even though I shouldn’t. I appreciate her so much for what she does for me but I hate myself for not being able to love her the way she deserves to be loved. 

It breaks my heart that I can’t always return the love to her that she shows me. She has her own problems in her life that far outweigh mine and yet she’s strong enough to put on a brave face for me and support me through my down times, I don’t know why I can’t be strong for her the way she is for me.

depression,2020/03/18,"I’m (29M) suffering from my wife’s (29F) depression The title sounds more selfish than I mean it, but some part of it is selfishness I suppose. My wife is extremely depressed and borderline suicidal. Since a miscarriage a couple years ago she has lost her best friend, painfully watched many other friends get pregnant, lost her job, and recent tests confirm lost many hormones as well (low estrogen). I’m not sure how long it’s been hormonal but I know our situation is dire. 


I’m currently a grad school student contributing nothing to this family but debt. It’s too intense of a program to have an actual job but I do work on a small contract type basis. My wife does not have a degree and since losing her job (business closed) has done everything to find another job worth more than minimum wage without luck. She’s an amazing worker but there’s just nothing even available here. She feels worthless and like she cannot contribute to society or anyone else. We also had to move in with her parents to afford things right now so we are in a bad spot with everything. With this new virus who knows when she will be able to find good, fulfilling work. 

In short, she feels like she’s 30 with nothing to show for it and nothing at all what she planned (losing our baby). We have no idea when things or how they will change. We can’t afford therapy and even when I’m done with school next May we will have so many bills to settle before feeling like we can try for a family again. I feel like I caused all of this going to grad school. I wish I could stop or go back in time but that I’m too deep to quit now with student loans and what I will make once I’m out compared to quitting. There’s absolutely no solution for my wife. 

Now you’re caught up. I try everything I can to make her feel better but I’m just watching her slip deeper and deeper into depression. Away from family and friends who don’t care enough. Away from myself who cares but causes some of it in her mind. And hearing her talk about suicide makes me want to kill myself it hurts so much to hear. I have no idea what to do. How do I address having nothing at 30? Any positive spin I try to put on her makes her upset or feel invalidated but not doing so just let’s me agree and suffer with her. I’m so defeated from being helpless to make my wife happier when that’s all I want in the world anymore."

How much longer am I going to have these brain zaps. Obv I’m going to take a small amount of Cymbalta on Monday so that I can FINALLY taper, but am I going to feel these brain zaps every minute until then? 



Tl;dr: how long do you have to not be taking Cymbalta until the brain zaps mostly go away"
depression,2020/03/19,"I feel empty, I don't know what to do. I feel extremely empty inside, lonely, depressed, anxious, overwhelmed, everything, but still empty.

I'm a 20F. I got broken up with a month ago now. It was my first breakup. He was my first everything. I was so happy. It feels like my insides are being ripped apart. I was depressed and all before the relationship, so these feelings aren't anything new, but they're creeping back when they hadn't in a loooooong time. And I made realizations that he really wasn't the BEST boyfriend to me, and that I deserve so much better, but it still hurts. I loved him with all my strength, I loved him with everything I had, and he broke my heart. He didn't cheat or anything, he just broke it off saying he didn't see anything improving and that he couldn't give me what I needed.

In the past month, life has been chaos. The breakup, being stressed with college and preparing for grad school, and now this coronavirus...my college went online for the rest of the semester, which means college from home. My home environment isn't good, it's extremely toxic. My mom is a narcissist, and abuses mentally and verbally. I'm already not doing well.

I'm also out of a job since my job was on campus at college, and some summer internships are cancelling their programs due to the virus. I don't know what to do.

I feel so lonely, my heart still aches, the world is falling apart...I feel horrible, and suicidal a lot."
depression,2020/03/19,"A friend that needs help I’m going to keep this short. I have a friend who is 20F and she I displaying a lot of depressive tendencies. She cries often, I have seen her attempt to self harm before, and she has said she has little will to live. I recently was diagnosed and treated for depression and I want to get her the same help I was able too because I am feeling significantly better than before. Unfortunately her parents aren’t supportive and don’t really see depression as a true issue. She has discussed it with them before and received little to no support. What should I do to help her get the treatment she needs?

Edit: I should also add she has begun to self-medicate with alcohol and marijuana making her feel “numb.”"
depression,2020/03/20,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I’ve been depressed but this feels different somehow. 
Hello, I’m sorry in advance for posting this. You guys probably get a lot of similar posts. (English is not my first language so apologies for any mistakes as well).

I (25F) suffered from depression a few years ago when I was in my second year of university. It turned out that living alone was very hard for me, I isolated myself and didn’t take care of myself. I was obsessed with losing weight as some sort of self-medicating. Eventually, I ended up in a eating disorder ward but got fired one year later because they did not know “what was wrong with me” and why therapy did not help. I went to a different psychiatrist in my hometown who was not specialized in eating disorders and got back on my feet again. She told me I had been depressed and we hoped that would have been the end of it. 

I ended up coming back one year later with more or less the same issues. After a few month I began to have random panic attacks. I would feel completely normal one second and then totally in panic the next. My psychiatrist told me I was probably depressed due to an anxiety/panic disorder. I got the right medication and left theraphy without much explanation as my therapist had to go on materniy leave. (Signing up for a different therapists would take months) After 3 months of feeling so much better because of the medication, it is now slowly “returning.” Most of the time I feel perfectly okay, but then this sudden feeling of sadness and hopelessness creeps up on me so fast that my heart rate increases and I sometimes and up in a panic attack. At such a moment I feel like I’m drowing, I scream and cry, push people away that want to help me (literally), and feel like I should run for my dear life. But there is nothing there? Once I get out of it all the negative feelings go away and I feel like I normally do. There is nothing that triggers this. I have no idea why this happens, why I’m sometimes so suddenly so sad, with so much feelings of hopelessness. 

Tldr: When I was depressed I felt like I was in a dark hole all the time and that I had nothing worthwhile in my life/a future. But these “moodswings” are so different from that depression I used to have, what is wrong with me?"
depression,2020/03/20,"I want to power down.. Hello all, i’m a 19F from the midwestern USA. I’ve been through a lot of trauma in my life and ultimately started going to therapy regularly at 12. Ever since then i’ve been diagnosed w depression, SAD, GAD, PTSD, among other things. Lately i wake up and as soon as i wake up i wish i could press a power down button that would shut me off for days on end, sometimes even weeks. I don’t know what this means, i don’t know what i should do about it. Usually i’ll wake up excited to talk to my boyfriend (18M) but he never seems to feel the same and then i go into this numb feeling. Does anyone else experience this?"
depression,2020/03/21,"I want my mom to stop ignoring me My (16F) mom constantly ignores me when I speak to her, and she tells me it's because she's working when I only walk in on her playing games on her computer. Today I said something to her, she didn't respond as usual, and I asked her if she was working and she said no. I know it seems stupid and silly, but I can't ever actually talk to her or have a real conversation with her because at some point of us talking she's just going to stop responding and refuse to acknowledge I'm there.

A while ago when I was very depressed, I was trying to tell her about my day at school and she once again refused to acknowledge me and I ended up relapsing again. If I even brought it up to her, she'd tell me to stop overreacting like she told me a few years ago when she saw my wrists after relapsing.

The way she treats me is very painful, and I have even considered suicide because I picked up some pieces of her personality and because I look like her. I don't know what to do anymore; I have brought her up to my therapist multiple times but I can't go to her anymore because of money problems. I cannot bring up my problems to my mom because she will only chalk it up to me not being on my medication, when that is absolutely *not* the case.

That is not only it: She constantly undercuts my achievements and comments negatively on my appearance. When she does talk to me, it's about my schoolwork. She has drained my completely emotionally, and for years I have only made it through school from fear of her being disappointed. There is much more; I don't know what to do anymore!"
depression,2020/03/22,"My sister is quite depressed and I don't know how to help Hey, 24M here, my sister 31F is suffering from severe depression. She does see a therapist but I don't know how helpful that is. She took up science in school and stuck with it till post grad and became a biomed science graduate. What she tells me is that she sucked at it and the pay was shit so eventually she couldn't take it anymore and left her job. It's been 2 months now and she's been sitting at home. Her passion lies in music and honestly she's pretty fucking good at it. But considering she's 31 now and out of job, I get worried seeing that she's just lost the will to do anything at all. I've asked her if she can upload some stuff on streaming services like YouTube and SoundCloud and see if she finds success there but she just won't do it. I don't earn but I supported her through her last few months of her job so that she could save enough money for herself and have some financial independence once she quit. But since then she just stays at home. I wouldn't call her lazy, but I think her confidence and self belief have taken a hit. I don't believe she should stick around and hustle in a field she's not interested in just to have some form of income, but I also know that staying at home isn't gonna help in any way. What should I do ? I'm not from a well off family so my father can't support her once he stops earning. I'm in med school so ill be earning soon but that ain't gonna be enough either. I don't like to bring this up and make her feel like I'm pressuring her to do something, it's just that I don't know how I can help her get her life back on track.

TL;DR - my sister's depressed and I'm not sure how I can help."
depression,2020/03/22,"A tendency to do the wrong things... For as long as I can remember I have had a destructive tendency. Knowing that the decisions I’m making hurt me and others but still going through with them.
I’m 28F. I’m married and have a loving family around me. My mom had a drinking problem growing up. And although it wasn’t as intense as some other’s stories on reddit, her actions still impact my life and life choices big time.
I’ll go through periods of time where I am “on top of the world.” So to speak. Just nailing it on everything. Being an awesome wife, friend, daughter and person all together. And then I’ll get stuck in this depression faze where I hurt those around me, whether with my words or my actions. I isolate myself. I make poor poor decisions and then fall into an even deeper depression regretting everything. 
This has been happening for years. And I’ve gone to all different types of therapy and taken meds and what have you, but I’m realizing that it’s just going to be something I’m always going to struggle with and have to work on. 
I’m posting really to just talk to others who go through similar troubles. I find a lot of comfort from redditors and am grateful for the feedback I usually get.

depression,2020/03/23,26F and no friends I’m not really sure how to even go about this. I’m 26 years old and almost completely friendless. I have looked back on my life the past few months because this has honestly been the loneliest year I have ever had in my life. The only people I truly have In my life are my mom and dogs. I know it’s sad and kind of pathetic but I’ve come to the realization that it’s true. I had a tone of friends in high school and after high school. I’ve truly never had a hard time meeting people or making new friends up until this point. I have a few acquaintances and A best friend of mine my relationship has recently changed. I’m just looking back on my entire life and keep asking myself did I do something wrong ? I know I can be bitchy sometimes but I’m also the person who is the life of the party. A lot of my life I have secretly dealt with depression and always compared myself to others which has been a huge downfall for me. I see everyone on Instagram and see how everyone is out either getting a drink with friends or just going for a walk.  I walk my dogs by myself and that is my socialization for the day. I think what scares me the most about being alone is that I depend on my mom so much. She is my only true friend honestly and she currently has cancer so all of this is making this 10x harder for me is because all I keep thinking is that something might happen to her. I think why I even wrote this is to know that I’m not the only person who had been threw this before and any advice someone can give me to help maybe make new friends or ideas to not feel so alone. I cry everyday and I want to start being happy again.

depression,2020/03/25,"Can having depression be traumatizing? I (34F) have struggled with depression my whole life (well, since 11yo) and am currently coming out of my worst major episode to date. It’s taken more than 2 years to pull myself out of the “severe” category. I’m still classified as moderate but I’m definitely on the up. Thing is, the last period has instilled in me a significant fear of relapse. The last 2 years were so painful I felt like I was torturing myself everyday. I felt like I was on the precipice of total madness simply from being so trapped in my own painful mind/existence. 

My SO is asking me to make some major life decisions that I know would be potential triggers for a depressive relapse and the thought terrifies me. I feel like this last episode fundamentally changed me, and I will never be the same again, never view the world or myself the same way, and never feel anything close to unencumbered joy or happiness again. It feels like a violent, near death experience (which it very nearly was on more than one occasion) that has left me afraid and, well, traumatized. 

Is that even possible?"

depression,2020/03/26,"How Can I (depressed 22F) Help My Husband (not depressed 22M) with my Depression? Hi everyone, as you can read from the title, I'm seeking help on how to help my husband with my depression.

A bit of backstory: I've struggled with mild-moderate depression and some anxiety since I was 15 and I have somewhat unhealthy ways of coping with it, but I'm still here, so they work, I guess? Before my husband, I've never had any true long term relationships, but you can probably tell that from my age haha. I consider myself extremely lucky to have found my soulmate, and that's why I'm writing this post.

Before my husband, I usually dealt with my spirals, breakdowns, and panic attacks alone, in my room, isolated from the world. Like I said, the mechanisms are somewhat unhealthy, but it's because I don't want to subject anyone to the toxicity I carry during my lows. I don't want to go into more details just in case they might be triggering.

Now that I'm with him, it's really hard to go through the same mechanisms. I would spiral, and it would bubble underneath me for hours, and I would be absolutely destroyed by my own brain, and my husband would be there to pick up the pieces. He's always been there for me during these times.

I love and care about him so much, so it physically and mentally hurt me so much more when I'm going through my lows. I learned that I have a terrible tendency to push him away, using excuses each more intricate than the last. I started to get these strong urges and impulses to hurt myself or behave violently when things don't feel resolved, and that's a huge part of my fear, that I'll end up dead. 

This hurts him as much as it hurts me, and I'm afraid of what might happen one day if I don't learn how to help him help me. What should I do to help my husband with my depression?

TL;DR: I (22F) want to help my husband (22M) better ways to cope with and handle my depression."
depression,2020/03/26,"Questioning: The Beginning Of Intelligence; A Free Book For The Masses \*I am not here for any commercial motive, The Book's PDF is free and I envision a movement called #QTBIMovement which with its momentum can bring a revolution in the life of the common man.

\*I post it here in the depression community because we all deserve to get out of the mind, emotion delusions the we have drown ourselves into and allocated tremendous amounts of energy and thought but where there is no escape except cycles of misery. We share a new perspective here and I encourage you to explore the ideas in the book. While people are mostly concerned about solutions to depression, we here, together question the very existence of depression. Is it perceived, invented ? or natural and then what is natural anyway ? Natural is cultural programming we are conditioned to. (Imposition of a concept to sensory inputs(for e.g daily experiences))

depression,2020/03/27,"My family is falling apart during quarantine. My family’s relationship has always been rocky but generally we just back off and calm down. Ever since quarantine started, we have all been fighting and picking on each other non stop and its miserable. 

My dad keeps leaving at night to “go do his own thing” which he has been doing for years and no body knows what “his own thing is”. I (17M) am constantly fighting with my extremely annoying sister (14F), which my parents are yelling at us for, all while my parents are also yelling at each other because my dad is never around (but is around more than usual on quarantine) and never does anything for the family and my mom hates him for it.

What do I do? I am having a terrible time and I just want this whole thing to be over. I am about ready to tell my dad to “get the fuck out of our house” because he is pissing me off more than normal as well."

depression,2020/03/27,"Evaluate My Message To My Depressed Bf my (18F) long-distance bf (19M) has been very withdrawn recently. i’m aware he has been dealing with his mental health for a long while, but within the year and a half we’ve been dating, this is the very first time i’m experiencing his depressive episodes to this extent.

this has been going on since mid january when his feelings of self-doubt and worthlessness became especially prevalent to me. he has opened up to me about how he feels and he has explained his thought process to me. since then until now, he can often go multiple days without responding back to me because of stress or lack of energy or just general apathy, which i understand. however, i’m guilty of becoming anxious and constantly wondering if i play a part in his sadness (though he has reassured me i don’t) - i’m trying my best to steer away from that mentality.

he hasn’t responded in 4 days so i was planning to send him a handwritten message (thought it’ll be scanned and sent as an image). please let me know if there’s anything else i can add to further emphasise the support and love i have for him and if what i’m saying is helpful and reassuring at all.

——————————————————————

i’m sorry i can’t do more for you my love. and i’m sorry if i may get upset at times, but please don’t interpret it as you not being good enough. you’re more than enough for me - you always have been. it hurts to know that you may be struggling so much more than i’m aware of and that i can’t comfort you in ways other than words. i know it may not feel like it but i believe you have the strength in you to hold yourself above this. i’m praying for you everyday and i’m trying my best to understand you in the most helpful way possible. i apologise if i’ve ever overwhelmed you, made you feel guilty or made you feel like a burden. i value you, you’re important to me and i care so much about you. there’s nothing i want more than for you to not have to endure so much pain anymore. please take care of yourself in the meantime and stay safe. take your time and don’t force yourself - i’ll always be here whenever you need me to be; whenever you’re ready. i’ve never stopped being proud of you and proud to have you. you’re my blessing. please don’t forget that i love you with everything that i have my darling.

depression,2020/03/27,"Hello fellow depressed POSes Hi I’m 21F. I’ve been suffering with depression since I was 12. I had abuse/neglect in my childhood. I’m struggling to find reasons to continue on. Nothing is great in my life. I go to a shitty college where I’m just barely getting by. I have absolutely no friends. I don’t have a job and have never had an internship. 

I’m such a loser I can’t even post on instagram or facebook because i don’t want anyone to look at me or see what i have to say. 

I have no hobbies or skills. I’m not particularly attractive or intelligent and i’m not good at anything that i’ve tried. 

I’m in a almost 3 year relationship, but i’m u happy. He’s much older than me and he abuses me, but I won’t leave because I know no one else would ever love me or put up with all of my issues. 

Basically I’m worthless and a waste of space. I’m not special in any regard and i won’t accomplish anything in my life. It’s hard for me to accept this."
depression,2020/03/28,"I feel like my friend doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. This is a really dumb and silly immature post, my apologies. 

I’m 21F and just can’t seem to get my friend out of my mind. I have a close guy friend (let’s call him H) that said he wanted to focus and study more. He told me he would be spending less time online and on social media.

It was cool with me at first. After 3 months of not hearing from him, I inquired to a mutual friend of ours asking if he spoke to H recently. Apparently H has been active on other social media platforms such as Instagram and has been posting/communicating to others actively. I don’t have Instagram so I wasn’t aware. 

I decided to reach out to him so I sent him a message but never got a response back. 

I can’t help but to find this so weird. If he wanted a break to study and focus on his college work but he’s constantly on Instagram and posting photos, it seems incredibly odd to me. I feel like he just got tired of me and found me annoying to talk to but he couldn’t straight up tell me. So he just made an excuse to take a break and avoid me. I can’t help but to feel so left out in the dark. I wish I knew what was going on with him exactly. I feel like I’m overreacting and there might be another reason but it seems so fucking weird to me. 

I feel like every friend I have eventually gets sick of me."
depression,2020/03/28,"Caught in a trap I’m not an English native; sorry for grammatical errors.

I (27F) have been depressed since I was maybe 11 years old. I’ve always been shy and was bullied a lot growing up. I’ve recently been dragging myself through my master’s degree. Now when I’ve arrived at my master thesis work, I feel like I can’t anymore. I feel like I’ve hit a wall. I can’t even answer emails or pick up the phone.

I’ve never had anyone I can talk to in depth about my depression or social anxiety. I have a few friends, but most aren’t the kind I can come to with my worst problems. They have their own lives or don’t reply consistently. I have a close friend, but sadly she’s not empathetic. She doesn’t understand most emotions, including depression. She’s called me weak for being too sympathetic.

I live with my parents, but they on the other hand can’t handle strong negative emotions. One starts screaming, while the other cries. While they’re decent and nice people, I understood early on that I couldn’t confide in them. It makes me sad that I still have to pretend to them like I haven’t been crying. 

I, too, have trouble taking my depression seriously. When I’m out and about with people, I can feel like I’m mostly fine. I love to joke around and make people laugh. In those moments I feel a bit silly for thinking that I’m sick. But it’s become worse recently. Even when I’m with friends, I’m losing the ability to experience pleasure. I forget what things I like, or where I want to go. I keep slipping into a dark hole.

I think I could use someone who could relate to how I feel and show some kindness. But I just feel like there isn't anyone. There's never been. I just feel judged, shamed, like a burden or like a big child. People are impatient or irritated. Except for short moments of people telling me they've also been depressed, the occasional ""you got this"" or ""be strong"", there isn't anyone. 

I don’t feel like I got this, and I don’t think I can be strong anymore. I’ve wanted to go to therapy, even though the thought scares me. To just talk to someone, anyone. But people tell me it doesn’t work, and I’m afraid of feeling worse if they turn out to be right. But I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I don’t want to be dead, or a burden. I just want to function."

depression,2020/03/29,"I feel useless Hi guys. I (23F) feel like an embarrassment, honestly. So angry at myself and my choices. I recently graduated from college. A degree I can’t even use. I came in with a full tuition scholarship and a music scholarship and I wasted it because I realized too late what I wanted to do. So, wasted a great financial opportunity most people wished they had. Racked up $30,000 debt for a useless piece of paper. I’m going back to a community college to try my hand at other things, but I’m worried I won’t succeed. 

I work and pay my rent and bills, but I’m reliant on my parents for financial help sometimes. That makes me feel more depressed. People my age have it all figured out, they have careers... homes... and I’m stuck. I feel like a failure, a drain on my family. I feel like I’m going nowhere. I miss my therapist, but I’m too poor to see her. I need medication to help beyond just Lexapro, but again... too poor to see a psychiatrist.

My parents say they’re proud of me, but I feel like that’s a lie. They constantly question me and my choices. Don’t blame them.

Am I the only one like this? Am I the only one who has just become a financial drain on others? I feel sick. So depressed. So useless."
depression,2020/03/30,"Back home because of COVID-19, I (25F) have noticed clear signs of depression in my ageing immigrant father (53M) and it's breaking my heart for not knowing how to help. My father immigrated to Canada back in the 70s, got lucky. With a 70K figure salary, his charm, and active social life, he was a happy clam with my mother. This all changed slowly when he quit drinking and lost the social group he nurtured since his 20s. He also lost his job in the 2008 crash and has since needed to resort to cab and truck driving because he never completed high school, and no longer was the breadwinner at home as my mother surpassed his income in a clerical finance role.

As an adult, he also cannot fill his afternoons or days with helping me or anyone in our family as all siblings are self-sufficient. During this strange virus, I have moved home to be with my family having formerly lived 3 time zones away. While the entire family (siblings and mother) resort to our rooms to work during the office hours of our respected jobs (PST/EST/MST), we limit our social time to lunch and dinner after logging off from the day. My father, however, has been out of work. The cab business is slow, and that resorts to him being at home. Without former hobbies or interests, he often spends unhealthy hours watching videos in English that he often does not understand. He has fortunately found interest in recipes and daring to cook, but it is all time spent alone. He does not seem to have friends he can socialize with, and will often walk, or nap throughout the day, curled up in a ball on the couch or bed. If he hears footsteps, he'll sit up or ask if he can help with anything.

I don't know how to help my father who appears to lost all zest for life. He is not needed and does not know how to spend his days if not working. He also grew up in a different generation where I imagine it hurts to not be the provider of the family and instead has become the house dad to no children.

I love my father dearly, and while I understand his situation may be unique, I just don't know how to help. I'm sorry if I didn't provide the correct details here, and I do appreciate any advice on how to strengthen my relationship with him or him with others.

TLDR; Immigrant father is visibly depressed, and I am now noticing clear signs while at home b/c of COVID-19. Unsure how to navigate this situation as he is very reserved and is attempting to fake being ""okay"" when others are around."
depression,2020/03/31,"I think my life is falling apart I hope you’re having a good night.

My [19F] mental health is out of control to the point where I can’t even get out of bed to do class work or basic chores, and I don’t think I’m on a good antidepressant (Zoloft) because I feel better when I’m off it versus when I’m on it.

I’m a college sophomore but I’m privileged enough to come from a family that pays tuition for me; but this semester I’ve essentially just failed all my classes and set myself a semester or two behind, and they don’t even know yet. On top of that I really just want to take a semester off and/or swap majors, but since my parents are in control, I’m afraid to go up to them about it. Especially since my father has a history of getting extremely angry when he gets stressed out. 

At the same time I still can barely operate on the day to day, I moved into my own apartment a month ago and have yet to unpack any boxes. I missed my last appointment with my counselor. But they’re also a school counselor, and they told me to stay with the school for the rest of the semester before finding my own licensed therapist in the community. I feel anxious just to ask them to swap my medication. 

My mental health on top of the coronavirus social distancing has also made it extremely difficult to make friends. I’m a not-so-charismatic extrovert so I get so bored and unmotivated when not surrounded by people and friends irl, but it’s hard to find people (and for good reason) bc of the virus, and even when reaching out to people online or before the virus stuff, my mental health just makes it impossible to put effort into anything. It’s awful and I know I’m going downhill but it feels like I’m not in control and can’t do anything. 

I’ve been high for the majority of this year so far, and I’m pretty sure I developed a habit out of smoking weed too

I have like no schedule or motivation/capability to do any work and I don’t know how to fix myself or my surroundings without being overwhelmed; it’s been building up and I’ve been getting some pretty toxic thoughts lately and its kind of getting worrying

Thank you for reading, sorry for rambling and being all over the place. I just really really needed to type this out somewhere."
depression,2020/03/31,"I’m a useless waste of space, throwaway side-piece 19F, I still live at home, have no license, and work a minimum wage part time job. I’m working on the license and have applied at countless potential employers... but to no avail. My mom hasn’t spoken a single word to me in several months.

Now I spend my days sleeping anywhere but my own bed with anyone who wants me, doing whatever drugs I’m offered. I’m such a fuck up, staring to think I should’ve gone to college or something. 

I’ve battled depression for so long and struggled with low self worth. This coronavirus has me thinking about how this isn’t a bad time to off myself because there most likely wouldn’t be a funeral.

I don’t know if I’m asking for advice, it’s more so that I don’t want to burden anyone in my life with my issues."
depression,2020/04/01,"I feel like I'm falling apart again. This time last year, I had a full-blown mental breakdown, my ex ghosted me, and I had a falling out with my best friend. I wanted to drop out of school and quit my job. I was having immense social issues at work and I was having suicidal thoughts again. I \[22F\] decided to start therapy in February of last year, I started seeing a counselor and psychiatrist at my University,  and I tried to be more active during my classes. It was the first time in many, many years that I had sought professional help or tried to connect with my peers. More recently, I moved out of the shitty apartment that my ex and I shared, and I finally left the retail job that made me super unhappy. I felt great, I was making monumental changes, I was prepared to finish out the semester and walk during my graduation next month. In a matter of weeks, I have lost my new job, my school has converted all on-campus classes to Canvas, and I've been confined to my apartment 24-7. I cannot see my peers, I no longer have co-workers to speak to, and I can't attend counseling or utilize any other service that I've been using to better myself. This morning I checked my e-mail and found that I am no longer under consideration for the customer service job I applied to since being laid off. I wasn't looking forward to the job, but emotionally it was a monumental letdown. Most people in my life (that I would hesitate to call my friends) told me that this particular job at this particular company is unpleasant, but they all emphasized that it is easy to get. They made me feel like any simpleton could get a job at this company, and now I feel like even more of a failure. I'm incredibly overwhelmed. I have also learned recently that my commencement for graduation might be canceled. At the moment, they have postponed it until August. The only people trying to keep in contact with me during the pandemic are my mom and my NDad. I'm trying to file for unemployment and it is honestly one of the most emotionally draining and arduous things I've ever had to do. At the beginning of this year, I felt like I had come so far like I had completely turned my life around, not I back to square one and I'm having suicidal thoughts again. I don't know what to do, and I have no motivation anymore. I feel like I can't have anything good, I can try but everything will fall apart again. I've been through awful things in my life, particularly my childhood,  and I really felt like things would be different this year."
depression,2020/04/01,"I'm emotionally scarred from a past friendship/crush. How do I get over this?  (23F) So back when I was 15 years old, I had a crush on one of my counselors, let's call him Dan. I admired him a lot, he played the same video games as me and he grew up in the same area as me. When I turned 17, I became a junior counselor along with him (the junior counselors were no different than the senior counselors). I still had a bit of a crush on him, but I focused on being friends with him along with the other counselors. We were pretty good friends for a few years. I went on a trip to Wisconsin with him to meet another one of our counselor friends. He came over to my house for a weekend and we toured the city and went to a parade. I made him gifts that I thought were friendly but it might have been my subconscious secretly wanting him to like me back. So it comes around that I need to pick somewhere to go to college. He suggested that I apply to his alma mater. I dismissed him at first and told him it was too close to home. He kept telling me to check it out. I eventually listened to him and I actually liked that school more than the others I visited. It turns out, I was accepted and ended up enrolling. I was excited but he kept getting more and more distant. I would text him and wouldn't hear back from him for days. I asked him about his friends on campus and if I could meet up with them. I ended up becoming friends with one of them but not the others. I invited him to a lot of campus parties and events. No reply. I finally asked him why he stopped replying. He said he didn't want to be friends with me anymore. He went on a tirade saying I was a bad counselor and he didn't like how I became friends with his friends from college. He didn't like how I went to the same college as him. This came out of nowhere. It hit me really hard. I didn't know what to do our say. I felt like the past year of our friendship was a lie and I'm still not over it. I felt like I constantly annoy people, and I'm incapable of having lasting friendships because they are eventually going to think I'm a horrible person and they're going to leave me. I fear that it's happening again...I'm friends with this guy who I am developing a crush on....and I feel like he's going to resent me for being nice to him and he's going to end our friendship because I'm being clingy...I really want to keep his friendship. I like him a lot and my STUPID romantic feelings are getting in the way...I want to tell him I have a crush on him and if he doesn't like me back, I just have to deal and if he's okay just being friends. How do I get over this trauma I experienced? It's crippling and it gives me anxiety every time I start a new friendship or relationship.

TL;DR

I have trauma from a previous crush who turned into a friend. He rejected me and said horrible things. How do I get over the trauma of him doing this to me while making new friends/having new relationships?"
depression,2020/04/02,"I (18F) need advice on how to help my boyfriend (18M) get through his depression. I myself am a sufferer of mental health issues, though I feel as though I cope as best I can. I remind myself of how lucky I am, whilst also not dismissing how I feel. I take necessary days off to in the long term aid my mental health. I have routines and resources to look forward to , I also have outlets to vent to in times of despair. I’ve dealt with depression long enough to over come it for the most part whilst still suffering . My brother attempted suicide when I was 12, and from that point onwards it was the beginning of my mental health issues. Though going through that, I know suicide is an option I will never consider, whilst even feeling suicidal. The lasting damage is too painful on those you love and I’ve learned how precious life is through this. In conclusion, I’ve come to terms with my depression being apart of me, and I’ve tried my best to adapt.
I’m glad I’m growing up in a period of time where mental health for the most part is normalised, if not I don’t think I would cope as-well as I do. Though my boyfriend on the other hand, struggles to see the light, and struggles to get through the day with his underlying depressive thoughts. These depressive thoughts have become darker. He doesn’t put the pressure of suicide on our relationship, though he has made it clear he has suicidal thoughts, and finds it hard to see past these thoughts. With everything going on right now and for him to not have his usual resources of happiness that help him through the day, he is getting worse. Also me not being there in person to comfort him is hurting him a lot. I feel myself getting overwhelmed by everything also but I’m still coping and believe this is temporary and it will all be okay. If I didn’t think this way I also would be cracking up alike him. But he can’t seem to take on this ‘it will be okay’ mindset, which is important right now. But it would be ignorant of me to get annoyed that he doesn’t think this way, because that’s an element of depression which he has, negative thoughts and feelings of despair.
I have voiced that I think he needs professional help, as have his friends( he got the courage to openly discuss his mental health to his friends, and have they also in return). He’s aware it isn’t fair to put this stress over us by opening up about how he feels(regarding his suicidal thoughts), though he can’t come to terms with getting to the point of talking to his parents. That would be the first step in getting towards professional help.
I can’t help put feel overwhelmed when the topic comes up. I don’t know how to react. I’m not a professional. My advice to him is to realise how he currently feels is only temporary, and that I myself go through bouts of depression. I get out of them. I’m okay for a while. I fall back. He has never experienced depression up until 2 years ago. I have experienced depression for the past 6 years. Hence, my reasoning for my development of coping mechanisms. He can’t come to terms with why he isn’t like his old self, why he isn’t happy all the time. We all have our breaking point I believe, when childhood happiness just fades. Though he often thinks back to when he didn’t feel this way. But I don’t know how to help that. 
With my experiences , and relatability to how he feels in ways, still doesn’t help. I never turn things on myself ,I simply resonate. I’m aware of how annoying it is when your upset and someone ignorantly makes it about them. I give advice as to how I deal . How I think he should approach things that will help him. But I can’t help him. I don’t know how to help him. But all I want to do, is to help and be there. I believe he is only going to get worse as this goes on, and I don’t know where else to go for advice. I myself will probably only worsen too, I feel we all will. But how do we keep sane in the midst of a pandemic? How can I help him keep sane and halt his worsening thoughts? I’m trying my best and advice is really what I need right now."
depression,2020/04/03,"My (28F) BF (26M) of 5 years got caught cheating on me while I am here in the Children's Hospital with our 2yo daughter who's intubated and fighting a viral pneumonia. 
I've been so tired. So depressed.. 
Dealing with different doctors everyday, my daughter's developmentally delayed with a seizure disorder. So it was a little more difficult for her to fight off this common viral pneumonia kids her age tend to get. 

I've been in the hospital since March 2nd with our daughter who turned 2 on the March 21st. Everything was going okay so far, her dad was coming over every night after work and being all the great things (bc otherwise I'd be pissed at him for not being here for us, we've had this fight one too many times) but he stepped it up this time. I told him I was so happy and proud that we were doing okay and he was here for us. But then COVID-19 hit us and suddenly shit got really real for us. They kicked out my mom one week and limited to visitors to only mom and dad at bedside... A week later Dad got kicked out, now it's only me allowed at bedside. 

It's been super rough going through all of this alone to say the least. Then things really started to get emotionally draining for me. Her dad started being  irresponsible, pulling rent money from our savings to buy weed, smoking way too much, spending long amounts of hours on the game. He stopped texting me back, I would get upset because I needed him here for me still and wanted to talk to him. I don't have anyone to talk to. He's supposed to be my person. We fought over that for a few days. I didn't talk to him for two days. 

His Facebook was logged in on his laptop that was left here for me to watch TV on. I got curious. He was liking this one girl's post at 5:00 in the morning (more on that later) he also unblocked one of his exes. Apparently he felt compelled to check up on them and see how they're doing at 5AM instead of thinking about us and checking to see how we're doing over here. Which really sucked. 

I questioned him, I asked him why he unblocked her,  he just was curious and wanted to see how she's doing apparently... The girl who cheated on him with her best friend. I questioned him about the other girl, the one that he was liking her post. He said he had no idea who she was and it just popped up on his timeline. 

We eventually 'sort of' get over our fighting. But I wasn't over it honestly, I was just tired of fighting. Tired of having to dumb things down for him and explain why his behavior is inappropriate and why it was hurtful for him to be a certain ways towards me. Regardless of how irritated he is. Things seemed kind of steady and okay. He's texting me often, calling me once he's out of work, bringing me food everyday again, all the great things... Telling me how he can't wait for us to be home so he can hold us and his arms.. All the great things he should've been doing all along. 

Then I find out that he's been messaging the one girl that he denied knowing through Snapchat. He's been consistently talking to her, he met her through his coworker. He lied to me about knowing her. He was planning to meet up with her tomorrow to ""hang out and smoke""

After telling him all of this and I knew the truth about it all he admitted it to me finally. He didn't really seem apologetic, didn't apologize. Kept saying he doesn't know what to say or how to fix it. He also said that he's not displaying any sympathy because he's ""half awake and super sleepy""

 I feel so shitty. 
I've been crying non-stop. I wanted to stay with him despite all of this to work this out for the sake of our daughter. He says he wants us to be a family and won't talk to her anymore, but I don't trust him. I'm already going crazy thinking about what he's going to do tomorrow and if he's going to lie to me and still hang out with her. It's already over. 

Hopefully we'll be getting discharged within the next week or so, and I have no idea where we're going to go. I don't want to go home to our apartment that's not a home anymore. My daughter is special needs and I haven't been able to work after graduating school because she doesn't qualify for nursing (something she needs) and there's not a daycare available that can watch her. My mom is not willing to help out much as far as daycare goes either. 

I don't know what the heck I'm going to do, but I do know that I can't go back to him after this."
depression,2020/04/03,"Can't work I(24F) would say I worked pretty hard o obtain this job I have right now. All my friends are working in IT and I wanted to feel like I belong, so I'm finally holding an IT position. The company I'm working for is a small one, so they try to use their resources as much as they can. That's why, even though I was on a project that wasn't finished, I've been also assigned to a new one. The new one is in an industry I've never worked in before, using some very old technology. And ever since, it's like a nightmare never stopping.... They expect that I finish the first project, while I'm working full time for the second project. It's a never ending circle. I can't sleep well, I can't foccus on the 'full time' project, I'm always tired, I have nightmare about work.... and worst of all it's like I'm reliving my time in college(3,4 years ago), where I was in a pretty bad place, causing me to also loose focus and not be able to do anything right. 

I know that I should be happy that I still have a job, giving the current situation, but really, I've never been this unhappy and stressed in my entire life. If I sound like a cry baby, please just tell me to wake the f up and stop complaining, I can take it. 

I'm also applying for other jobs during this period, hoping I could quit the current one. I never despised doing something so much."
depression,2020/04/04,"Depression morphing into rage Lately I've been feeling my depressive thoughts moving further towards an overwhelming sense of frustration. Lying around doing nothing is now being accompanied by temper tantrums and meltdowns. The depression makes me so goddamn mad and then the anger just funnels back into a deeper depression once I've calmed down. 

It's weird, I never thought of myself as having an anger problem. My parents and teachers were always concerned that I never seemed to show enough emotion. But now when I'm outside I've been punching holes in walls, breaking things and getting into fights. I feel myself getting more exasperated by the day, at my depression, at this state of being, my life, everything.

depression,2020/04/04,"My conservative Christian parents don’t believe in depression despite my multiple suicide attempts and self-harm So to keep it simple, I (16F) grew up in an extremely Christian family. Basically they believe depression is caused by not reading the Bible or praying and junk like that. 

In 5th grade I was being racially bullied and became severely depressed. I started cutting myself and in 6th grade I confessed what I had been doing to myself to my parents, which took so much courage. I wanted to get help. Instead they punished me and accused me of doing it for attention. It still traumatizes me to this day.

So that just made it worse. I still vividly remember looking up how to kill myself on my iPhone 4 while tears streamed down my face. I even hid a knife in my pillowcase. I was only 12 and I wanted to die. This happened from 5th to 7th grade. 

Luckily we moved somewhere else. I’m 16 now and I’m not suicidal anymore but I believe I’m still struggling with depression and severe social anxiety, but my parents would never take me to a therapist/psychologist. What do I do. I feel hopeless to get better."
depression,2020/04/05,"why do I feel so lost all the time ? Some background : 23F, studying mechanical engineering, passed all my exams since the day I started college. In a 3-year relationship with a 28M, also engineer. But something just doesn't feel right. I feel ""broken"", as if a part of me was just cut off of me and thrown away and I can't find it back. In December, I just couldn't stop crying, all the time. He would come back from work to me, crying in despair. Something just hurt, still hurts but less and I don't know what it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel lost, all the time. Am I doing what's best for me ? Is being an engineer what I really want to purse for the years to come ?  Am I just depressed ? What's my purpose in life ? I just don't know what to think anymore and it just hurts all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like packing all my stuff and leaving for another country. But is it really going to change how I feel inside ? Is it just a dumb way to cope with my anxiety over my life ? I just wish someone who'd tell me that it's going to be okay in the end, that I'll eventually find my path, I'll find a purpose ...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just crying over this, not knowing what to do to change my mindset. Should I seek help ? Should I just wait as this feeling could magically go away ?

depression,2020/04/05,"Is it normal to want to break up with my girlfriend because I feel like a loser? What should I[20M] do? There are days when I cry because I hate myself and see myself as a horrible loser. I feel like I haven't achieved anything that I ever wanted and the path that I am going down, graduating and preparing for phd admission, isn't something I want to do. It's just family pressure. Nevermind all these things. The main problem is I love my girlfriend[21F] and I can only see a bad future for her if she remains with me. On my bad days, I feel like I should break up with her to give her a better life, although she is one of the few reasons I have still been able to keep myself from breaking down.

depression,2020/04/05,"I’m falling So I sit in bed daily and sleep. Sometimes I get up to eat, walk around or cook, but mostly I just lie in bed and fall in and out of sleep. 
My (19F) boyfriend (25M) is a really great help, but he is also going through depression and has constant, overwhelming anxiety. He really needs my support and I want to be there for him.
I grew up in a privileged family, and I know that. I am so grateful for the life I was given, but for some reason I feel this bitter coldness enveloping me more and more. I don’t want to go outside and do things, I don’t enjoy things like I used to. I just sleep. I’ve been seeking help from psychologists, psychiatrists and GP’s but I also feel like I’m not worth their time. As if my problems aren’t worth it. Maybe that’s why I sugar coat things and say that things aren’t that bad. That I’m coping okay. 
But really, I feel so close to doing something reckless. It feels like no one can see how close I am to drowning, but some part of me will smile and tell people I’m okay because I feel immense guilt from even suggesting that I’m not.
What’s wrong with me?"
depression,2020/04/06,"Productivity kept my depression away, and well, it's back. 23F. I've learnt from a young age that keeping myself productive kept my depression and suicidal thoughts at bay. The only ""productive"" things that worked were school or work. Volunteering, hobbies, execising etc wasn't productie enough for my brain to leave me alone.

If I wasn't in school, I was working. If I wasn't working, I was in school. I \*need\* a 9-5 or something to occupy my days to feel productive and have me depression stay at bay.

Fast forward to now. COVID19 hits. My job that I had lined up for the summer months just informed me that they can no longer take me on, due to cutbacks caused by COVID19. Now I'm unemployed student, and in August 2020, I'll be an unemployed graduate. I've been applying to jobs like crazy for when I graduate, and now it'll be even harder that the country will be still dealing with COVID19 \*and\* in a recession.

I'm trying hard to stay positive, but I can't. I'm so afraid. I'm so scared. I'm scared to be unemployed because I know what comes along with it. Depression and suicide. Suicide has always been my backup, my comfort blanket, in case things don't pan out. And unfortunately this time, it looks like this aren't going to pan out. I keep telling myself that eventually I'll hear back, give it 4 months or a year. But I know I won't be able to wait it out that long. A week into unemployment and I'm already thinking of ways to go.

I guess I'm just looking for anybody who experiences something similar. Having their self worth tied to productivity, or their job?"
depression,2020/04/06,"Debating whether to commit on April 20.  Hello, I am 16F. I am selectively mute which makes it nearly impossible to make friends. I did have one but she got more popular than me, changed into a different person and let her new friends bully me. I cut her out but she’s the most liked person at my school and turned everyone against me. This isn’t as big of a concern anymore since school is canceled, but I’m still so depressed. I had my first boyfriend 22M I met in an instagram community and we got very close. I realize the age difference was wrong but I was too caught up in it and thought I loved him. He added me to a discord chat with his friends and it was okay for a while. We exchanged pictures (i really only do this if i think i love someone) which I deeply regret. Then after 2-3 weeks one of his friends in the group chat was being mean so he called her out on it and she got really mad. She posted on her instagram story about our age gap and had all her friends send him mean messages. We broke up which was really upsetting. Then just a few days ago I met someone on here I really liked and I got too excited and we exchanged pictures quickly. I liked him a lot but he’s also suffering with depression and told me he’s blocking everyone so he’ll be able to kill himself tonight. I am devastated and angry with everything. And it’s not only stupid high school drama, I absolutely cannot connect with anyone. I cannot make friends, I am always a second choice. And I have since left that instagram community where all my online friends were so i have no one to talk to. I’m so angered with how cruel and thoughtless people are. And if you look at my profile you’ll see I post in r/selfie often, I am aware that I can be attractive sometimes. I post those pictures to get attention from men that I don’t get irl. I promise I look completely different in person. My skin is covered in acne, I have greasy hair and my bangs are too short, I feel fat all the time, I dress weird.  I get bullied at school. I don’t care how pretty I look to weird men that message me. I hate everything and everyone around me and when I’m not suicidal I’m homicidal. I am currently on 20mg of Prozac and went to the Psych Ward a few weeks ago but am still extremely depressed. I’m failing online school. I know how to slit my wrists but I’m afraid. How many mg of Prozac will kill me?"
depression,2020/04/06,"Divorce because of depression? I'm (26F) not sure how to word this. I've had depression for a few years,  diagnosed about 3 years ago. I was on a few different kinds of meds and it kind of worked for the most part. It did, however, mellow me out completely. No bad lows, but no great highs anymore either. My husband (33M) expressed his concern with my emotional flatness (and zero sex drive) and I got off the meds This was maybe 6 months ago. I also changed birth control methods and then got off those completely too, about 3.5 months ago in an effort to be myself again. My depression has crept back up over the last couple of months and my sex drive is still zero. I've been taking addyi for almost a month now with no results, but I know it can take up to 8 weeks so I'm hopeful. 


Anyway. I've had good days and bad days lately. On the bad days I emote less and just sit around, basically. Nothing terrible. Just not ideal. My husband just came to me with his concerns again that I am not pleasant enough around him and I need to fake it till I make it--not his exact words but that was the sentiment. I don't really know what to tell him. I said it's a process and I'm doing my best and he pointed out that when he met me 6 years ago I was not like this. He's right, I wasn't depressed then. He was very clear that he does not want me to force myself to have sex with him, so that's not the issue. The issue is I feel like he's ready to divorce me because I'm depressed and I literally do not know what to do. I can't help this. He's a control freak and he's trying to control my emotions I guess? I just don't know if this will get better or what I can do, other than getting back on an antidepressant. Any advice is welcome."
depression,2020/04/07,"I don’t want to live But I can’t kill myself. I’ll never do that to my family or my boyfriend, I know it would crush them and ruin their lives. However, I really, really, don’t want to live anymore. 

Some days are better than others - I can feel “I’m okay right now”, while the majority is apathy, feeling like it will never be a life well enough to live. When I wake up I want to go to sleep again. Nothing excites me. It’s like I’m always waiting for the will to live to suddenly appear. 

Let me just add that I do everything I can to feel better: therapy, exercising, healthy eating, doing hobbies, talking to people about it, reading self help books and so on. I like my therapist a lot, she has helped me in many regards. But now I’m slowly feeling myself falling further down the depression hole. I hate living. If it weren’t for the sake of my family, I would’ve died a long time ago. 

Btw, I’m 20F and have been depressed since I was 12."
depression,2020/04/09,"Extreme humiliation by my family My fam consist of me, mom, dad and bro. I am so sick of how they humiliate me everything and it totally depresses me. 

Look, I have a really nice reputation in my school and in my circle. I have won scholarships for Apple in California. On social media, people are super kind to me. 

And in my family, specially my mom (45F) is so frustrated by her life. She is super moody and always screams, I mean, barks on me. She screams if I left a book of mine on table or I accidentally dropped coffee on floor. 

You see how she yells me at every little thing. Like, outside and inside my house is completely different world. 

I am working on a big app project during self-isolation... and she is very angry and like, pours out all of her anger on me. 

Her doctor said she is almost going through to menopause. She is like, if I am humming a song at 6 in morning, she starts yelling and telling ""It's my house, shut up and mind your business""

This really tears me apart. I really try not to listen to them, but, there is a limit till which I can do.. 

Some days, she brings me gifts and talks to me nicely, others days she yells at me and tell me that go and die. That's so weird 

What would you do if you were at my place? Would you stay lonely and sad all the days working on great things ?"
depression,2020/04/10,"What happens after you get help? Like, what happens next?

I've (21F) been diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety last Feb. 21, and have been taking prescribed meds since and keeping regular enough contact with counselor (esp. during self-quarantine)

There's just a lot of big talk about mental health, about getting help, reaching out and all that. And I know about healing or progress not being linear, and there will be ups and downs to this. And I know not everyone's experience will be the same, but I just would like to know at least some semblance of what's going to happen next?

Sorry if this post is too vague. I just find myself stuck and I don't know I don't know where the world is headed to tomorrow and all that. And I would appreciate any response to this, and maybe have something to look forward to?"
depression,2020/04/10,"Feeling inferior to sibling I (24F) have always felt inferior to my brother (28M) and it’s causing me to feel depressed when he is around. 

Growing up, my brother and I didn’t get along and he was so mean to me that now he is trying to mend his relations with me, however I still feel uncomfortable around him and then with everything else I’m about to say.. it’s definitely hard for me to feel happy. 

I have always been more introverted, where he has always had tons of friends and was athletic and did well in school without having to try. Now he is running marathons in other countries, has a great job and a serious girlfriend that my parents love (when my parents never show that same love to my SO). He also has done a program through Harvard and has been so successful while I’m struggling to find a job. 

I know it sounds lame to feel so depressed and inferior, but I just want to cry and isolate when he is around with my family. I feel as if my parents don’t see me as amazing as he is."
depression,2020/04/10,"desperate thoughts surround me I am 22F and I think I suffer from severe depression and stress. For two years my life is getting worse and worse. My past is dirty. I lost my contact with my parents 7 years ago. My closest friend terminated our relationship lately. I live alone in a city which I hate. I can't focus on good things. I just think about bad things and my past. There are some regrets in my life. Despite all, I still have hope and do not give up but, my life quality is so low. How can I embrace optimistic thoughts? How can I increase my persistence to be alive? I just want to leave everything and start a new life."
depression,2020/04/11,"I just read about my fiancés cheating? So hi. I (23F) have know hime since 6 year. Together since 2. He has never expressed anything homosexual before 1 year. He startef dating an asian boy (AB), really immature, directly into a relationship even tho my fiancé stated that hes engaged. Showed up to our flat, his work, call, etc. I have always believed him that the AB was the one doing it on his own. Well. I just saw that he got instagram messages from the AB, tipped on them (I KNOW WRONG) and well..before me unfolding months old textmessages between them, my fiancée mostly being the first one. 99% sexual, when I am gone etc.

depression,2020/04/12,"I (21F) think I might have depression. I had a really rough upbringing and I’ve had anxiety for most of my life. By the time I was about 12, I KNEW I had anxiety, but I was too anxious to do anything about it. Finally, when I was 19 I went and got diagnosed and have been medicated ever since. It has changed my whole life for the better. 

I remember when I was getting my diagnosis and the nurse asked if I thought I was depressed. I said no because I didn’t feel sad all the time or suicidal. 

However, I have noticed that I get into these phases where I lose all motivation, get overly emotional about everything, binge-eat, and just feel empty. I’m in one of those slumps right now and I talked to my fiancé about it. He thinks it could be depression, as he’s witnessed me get like this 4 or 5 times in the last 2 years. 

I know it’s a hard time for everyone right now, but this isn’t the first time this has happened to me. I always end up neglecting my housework and schoolwork (which is unlike me when I’m feeling good). I just lay on the couch for all hours of the day and feel crappy about myself. Food doesn’t sound appealing unless it’s from a drive-thru. I just lost 25 lbs before I got into this slump and I’m SO scared to step on the scale now. 

I guess I just came here for some advice or opinions. Does this sound like depression?"

depression,2020/04/12,"Loneliness and emptiness I don't even know where to start this here.  I am a 20F and I have been diagnosed with clinical depression since I was 11. I take medication since I was 12, nowadays, I take about 10 pills a day of antidepressants and anxiolytics, due to this treatment for a long time, I am chemically dependent on clonazepan.
 This has been present in my life since I was young (I had not even had my first period), I was not able to “learn” how to socialize, develop and maintain any type of relationship (friendly or romantic), I always had very low self-esteem, it was always me for me.
 I believe that in adolescence (from 13) it was the most difficult time, in addition to low self-esteem, I had problems with acne and my biotype does not fit the aesthetic standards.  And there came the bullying ...
 I had a hard time making friends at the expense of all that ...
 At the time I would like to be like the other girls, I would like their approval.
 But the moments I remember most were self-harming, hidden crying, suicidal and self-destructive thoughts.
 My teenage experiences were late.
 Today I am in college, little of that has changed ... I still have difficulty in relating to people, I know how to make friends but the difficult thing is to develop and maintain them, I continue with my self-esteem practically non-existent and the feeling of helplessness and  replacement up there.
 I've dealt with so much rejection in the affective field that I feel that I don't deserve to be loved, they never ask me to stay, they never ask me to come back.  There will always be a better person than me ...
 And this quarantine it has been a hell because I just don't have contact with just about anyone (other than parents).  If I had a conversation, it was with two people at most and I started it, because if I depended on their initiative, there would be no conversation.
 I am an only child, I am feeling very alone and I realize that my presence in the lives of some people is indifferent because nobody wants to know how I am.  If I'm fine, what am I doing.
 It's like I died.
 My self-destructive thoughts are racing through my mind and I think I'm going to do some shit.

 That's it, I just wanted someone to know how I'm feeling.
 Has anyone who has clinical depression experienced a crisis due to this quarantine?"
depression,2020/04/14,"My girlfriend needs help. Hey everybody. I’m (22M) pretty much lost on how to help my girlfriend (20F). For the past 3 weeks or so she’s been suffering from what I would say is moderate to severe depression.

This past week was especially tough. She confided in me that she’s been sexually abused periodically over the past decade by a family friend, including one incident that happened the day before she told me all of this. She made me swear not to tell anybody or do anything (since I know the perpetrator’s name). I have since held that promise.

Now what’s even trickier is my girlfriend hardly has any family to confide in even if she wanted to. Her mother left at a young age. Her father who raised her and she still lives with, is a really great dad. But they never connected emotionally and she refused to tell him after I pleaded her too. Her reasoning was that she didn’t want to burden him and ruin the great life he’s provided for her.

So I’m really in a pickle. I love this girl to death. Yesterday was a better day. On her good days she can do things, but is slightly tired. Today is a bad day. She’ll stay in bed all day on her bad days. She also always texts me after I leave on her bad days and says I deserve better, and that she doesn’t wanna me to be hurt by her depression. It terrifies me but I believe this is the depression talking.

I’ve been researching a lot about depression and what I should and shouldn’t do. I’ve looked up local mental health clinics... as I believe she needs professional help. But everything is closed with the COVID-19. She‘ll probably refuse anyways, having told me before that depression medication never worked and neither did counselling. 

Reddit, please educate me. What should I do? I told her I’d support her no matter what."
depression,2020/04/14,"In a failing relationship with severe depression I’ve (20F) always struggled with mental health but in the last year and a half, my depression got severe to the point of suicide being on my mind at all points of every day. I’ve been living with my boyfriend of over a year for a few months and found out recently that he had been buying nudes from some random girl on Snapchat (not even a hot celebrity, just some girl that lives in our state). I already had no hope, no love for myself, no trust for him, etc. and really don’t know how to cope. I’m not going to leave him because I feel like I don’t deserve any better and wouldn’t have a better relationship with someone else anyways. I really don’t know what to do anymore. Especially with being cooped up all day everyday during quarantine with him."
depression,2020/04/14,"I’m losing patience with my mother. My (26M) mother (53F) is divorced these four years and is still grieving the end of her marriage. My mother is diagnosed with depression and she also has epilepsy. In the wake of her divorce, she leaned into her evangelical Christian upbringing and began to pray nightly vigils in her closet for my father (55M) to return to the family (mind you all, he is still in our lives and simply lives across town). My father was physically and psychologically abusive to her but she begs God to bring him back every day. She hangs her hopes in her “prodigal husband” returning on a... spiritual experience she had whilst in prayer at a church service: she claims to have heard the voice of God in her ears as clearly as I would speak to her, saying, “You’re praying the wrong prayer- (ex-husband’s name) must return to ME before he can return to you.”

Bear in mind that psychotic illness runs in her family, as does suicide. But she believes God spoke to her so she can never give up praying that my father will return. I’ve told her that the quality of our lives has improved since he left and my relationship with him has improved as well. Dad has grown as a man and, as unlikely as it should have been, has made amends for his abuse to my brother and me. He was criminally neglected and abused as a child and has come to terms with how it stunted his function as a model husband and father, but he will not re-marry my mother. My brother and I are grown and he will not again place himself in a circumstance that would tempt his abusive tendencies.

IANAD, but I am certain that the “voice of God” that my mother heard was a grief-induced hallucination *and a maladaptive one at that.* It has impeded her acceptance of the end of her marriage. She weeps on the sofa *every day these past four years* for Dad to return and that they can build the ideal, Christian family *that they never had in the first place.*

I’ve nearly lost all my patience for her daily grieving. She visits a... faith-based therapist monthly and refuses to see anyone else (the therapist is a quack and employs an [e-meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter?wprov=sfti1) in his sessions). Yes, I do live with her to monitor her epilepsy.

Any advice how to break this spell?

EDIT: If I’m grieving anything, I’m grieving my mother’s lost four years. I’ve met so many strong women from similar circumstances take voyages of self-discovery after divorce. They become stronger and more sure in their independent identities. They even become feminists! But my mother sinks lower and lower by the day, pining her lost role as a submissive wife. My dad has a girlfriend now and they live together and she has become spiteful, hateful. I just want to yell at her, “GET OVER IT! IT’S OVER!”"

depression,2020/04/15,"Medication and Parents I [20F] have been wanting to take meds because I have been suffering from depression, anxiety, and ptsd for 6 years now. I have been on and off meds and in and out of hospitals at the start. I haven’t taken meds in about a year because I still live with my mother and she does not like me taking them. It actually weakens our relationship because of how angry she gets when I have them prescribed. She tells me, “You’ve been doing so well, why the f**k do you need drugs?!” and acts like i’m some monster. The problem is, I rely on my parents to pay for my doctors visits because I only make enough money to pay my bills, and get gas to commute to school (far). Has anyone else been through this? I feel pathetic because I am 20 years old and my mom acts like i’m doing a war crime by trying to better myself. I’ve tried yoga, exercise, meditation, eating healthy, etc. Nothing holistic works when you genuinely have a chemical imbalance, what else am I supposed to do? I guess I am just here to find some support or people who can relate.

TL;DR: My mom thinks I’m insane for taking meds for my depression/anxiety/ptsd even though i’m 20 years old and have been going through this for 6 years. It weakens our relationship when she finds out that i am taking them."

I haven't been this bad in a while. Usually on my less bad episodes I can at least convince myself to try a shower or a walk or cook something or text a friend. Now I'm just like..... what's the point. No.

depression,2020/04/17,"How to cope with having no friends? Does it get better? So I'm 23F and a recent college grad. I've never been popular but I've always had a few friends and in high school I had two best friends. By sophomore year of college I lost all my friendships from high school but I did meet a really great girl my freshman year and we became really close. We were best friends all through college but by senior year she became more and disant until we stopped talking (we're from and live in the same town by the way). She just stopped talking to me. I texted her a few times asking if she was ok and she said ""We're not a good fit as friends but I wish you a good life"". I haven't heard from her in almost a year now. The only person I have left that I talk to is a guy who I was friends with high school. We've had a weird on/off relationship and we basically just text each other. I do like him but he's hurt me in the past and my family don't really like him (long story). 

Anyway, I just feel so lonely. There's never been a time in my life when I really have no one that cares about me. Yes, I do have good parents and I love them but they are all I have left. And my parents won't be around forever. I wish I just had someone to connect to, whether a friend or a boyfriend. It doesn't help that I live at home and am unemployed right now because I just graduated college right when this coronavirus stuff happened. I'm also an only child so the only person who really likes me is my mom. So I just stay at home and read and play video games. I haven't been diagnosed with depression but I am definitely an anxious person and I am sad most days but I don't have any other depression symptoms.

depression,2020/04/17,"It feels so revolting that I have to take meds to just get through a shit career, I absolutely refuse to take them again anymore. Context: 26F, I've graduated med school last year and I totally hate this career. Not gonna bore you with details, but it wasn't my choice at all, I was forced to do this mainly by my parents (really prestigious career in my country). I have severely suffered through college, had a lot of breakdowns and stuff, but when it was really really bad, I had to start going to psychologist/psychiatrist and taking meds. Started with Fluoxetin, felt even more dead inside than without it (more than 6 months of treatment), didn't feel hungry or horny or anything and plus some intense stomachaches. Changed to Bupropion. Wow, it worked like a charm, I felt calmer (although slightly more irritated than normal), no side effects, etc.

However, I can't go on more than 3 or 4 months straight with the medication before I drop it. I know it's wrong, believe me (psychiatric rotation was specially graphic in this aspect), but it feels really revolting that I have to drug myself into acceptance of something I wasn't even consulted, that I was forced to do and that I hate to my very core. I have to work in the field now (even harder because of covid) and I know it's crazy, but it seems ""better"" to feel like shit without medication because it seems I can really feel how deplorable things are and how my work life is something I should be at least embarrassed about because I wasn't brave enough to jump the ship when I was still young and I could do something else. It feels specially bitter when I see all my relatives and friends staying at home and I have to go out every day and put myself at risk doing something I truly despise.

Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful career, I'm just not meant to do it.

I just wanted to vent, but if anyone has any tips, it would be really appreciated!"
depression,2020/04/17,"Dealing with a depressed dad Hi guys this is probably a rant but I don’t know what else to do. 
I am 25F and my dad (55M) is depressed and emotionally unstable/immature. 
A couple years ago he revealed to us at home that he grew up in an abusive home (his dad was an alcoholic and physically abusive/possibly sexually abusive). Prior to telling us this he used to idolize his father in an almost obsessive way. I am a girl but he named me after his FATHER and gave me a male name as my middle name. 
This childhood abuse makes sense because he has always been emotionally immature and irresponsible. I am 25 years old and I have NEVER depended on my dad. He is terrible with money and always in between jobs. He also worked in many different countries when i was growing up and so we have never had such a close relationship. 
My dad is a very traditional indian/Hindu. He does not believe in going to a doctor for his depression but has attempted suicide multiple times. Instead he goes to gurus and yogis to help him and has an obsession with yoga. I do not believe this helps him because he is still depressed and searching for meaning in life. Because of this he is obsessed with helping the poor. This isn’t a bad thing i know, but he does it to the extent that he runs us into debt to give to others and STEALS things from our home to donate to others so he can feel good about himself while putting his own family through duress. It has caused a huge rift in our family as my mother is the only person who provides for my 2 siblings and i and he puts a financial strain on our lives with his desperate attempt to “find purpose”. But i feel bad for him because i know he is a very sad person on the inside. 
When my siblings and i started working he started asking us for money all the time so he could donate it or build yoga studios for his gurus. I am not trying to offend anyone but i do believe some of these gurus are scam artists and some of these yoga groups are like cults. I am not a religious person and I don’t think any religion is beyond reproach. I think he gets taken advantage of by these gurus who use him for his money. 
His siblings also take advantage of him by constantly asking him for money. Many people take advantage of him for money and he gives it to them because he needs to feel “fulfilled”. Then he comes to us and takes our money because he has none. 
As an aside, after high school i was accepted to every college i applied to and one was my dream school to study Aerospace Engineering. I was unable to go because my dad said he had no money. A couple years later when one of my cousins wanted to study at her dream school he offered to sell some of his real estate to pay for her education (as a donation) so he could feel good about himself. I have never forgiven him for this. He goes out of his way to provide for others and does NOTHING for my siblings, mom and i. 
No one in my family can tell my dad anything about his terrible money habits because he gets depressed and threatens to kill himself so we just have to let him do him for all these years. 
Now that covid-19 is happening we’re supposed to stay in our houses to avoid being sick. My dad has recently had a surgery and is diabetic so he is at risk for covid-19. My older sister is a covid-19 doctor on the frontline treating patients and isolated at the hospital. She has called and told my dad repeatedly to stay at home because things are bad. He refuses to stay at home and goes out everyday to build his yoga studio and make donations. He has taken my credit card and spent thousands on this studio and these donations in the past few weeks when i am currently out of a job due to covid and need to save my money as i am migrating to Canada to start a new life soon. 
This has been my breaking point so today I finally told him about his spending habits and the fact that none of his children feel like they can rely on him as a parent. It was a bad fight and he has not been talking to me since and seems upset. Now i am worried he might do something to hurt himself or that i may have made him more depressed which wasn’t my intention but i just lost it today after YEARS of dealing with his behavior. I have also dealt with an cocaine addicted cousin and i still feel like my father’s behavior has been more stressful to deal with. 
I don’t know what to do now so maybe someone can help me? It is not my intention to cause pain to anyone but how do you balance this? Must i always let him take advantage of me because he is depressed? I feel like his depression has ruined my life in many ways but I don’t want him to kill himself over things i try to address in his behavior. Should i just let him do as he pleases and then maybe i can go to therapy to help deal with the stress he causes me rather than try to address it directly with him seeing as he is not emotionally mature enough to handle criticism? Someone please help me."

depression,2020/04/17,"What is the best way to help/support boyfriend with persistent depressive disorder? Already posted on depression help. Hoping this reaches more people. 

(Throwaway account) 

It started years ago when my (21F) boyfriend (23M) mentioned to me that he’s never actually happy. He will laugh and have fun but he’s never actually happy. Since then, I’ve encouraged him to go to a doctor. He decided to see one and was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and sleep deprivation. However, he never went back to get medication, nor did he seek therapy or receive any kind of professional help. It constantly affects our relationship and so I asked him to get therapy. After much delay, he decided to go and from an outsiders perspective, it seems as though the therapy was slowly starting to help him manage his depression. Since the coronavirus pandemic sent us home from college, he’s been getting worse. Not showing up to online classes and missing assignments. He’s also been distant and I have no idea what he’s thinking or doing. 

I just want to make sure he’s okay but don’t know how to help since we can’t see each other. We recently got into an argument because his depression has made it hard for me because it feels like I’ve been carrying the relationship for a long time. I have never had depression before so I have no idea what the experience is like. All I can do is sympathize and try to understand as much as I can from an outside perspective. And this isn’t about me but his depression has deeply affected our relationship. I wanted to break things off but immediately regretted saying that. I think that really hurt him and he hasn’t spoken to me in over a week but said he will reach out when he’s thought about things more. I don’t know what to do. I want to help him and our relationship. I want to be there for him. Do I reach out? When should I reach out? Would trying to talk to him when he isn’t ready going to make things worse? He says that he did see a future with me but now things are foggy. I’m not quite sure if this is linked to depression. Maybe some of you guys can help elucidate this situation for me. 

I want to ask those of you who know what it’s like to experience depression about what helps you the most. I care so much about him and I just want to do what’s best for him, his mental health, and our relationship."
depression,2020/04/18,I feel ugly and shitty and idk what to do. Uhm I’ve never written anything on reddit. But I guess I just need a place to share. I’m a 15F. And I’ve recently felt really depressed especially because of quarantine. I just feel like everything is going down hill and I can’t bear to look at myself and take pictures because I just feel so ugly compared to other girls on social media with pretty eyes and small noses and clear skin and beautiful big lips. I asked my bf to rate me (yes stupid idea ik) and he said I was an 8/10 idk why but that made me really upset. Maybe it’s bcs i saw instagram posts of bf saying that their gf is the most beautiful girl in the world etc. I’ve also started c*tting again. All I do is sleep all day and do nothing. I feel like absolute shit. I also don’t have any friends. And I just feel lonely. And I don’t know what to do. Sometimes it just feels like ending it all is better and will take all my problems away. This post is really stupid I’m sorry.
depression,2020/04/18,"I’m not getting better I’m (22F) an undergraduate nursing student, graduating this year and starting work in July/August. Just some background, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder in 2018 but wasn’t consistent in taking my medications (Fluoxetine 40mg, Lorazepam 1.5mg) or going for my psych appointments. At one point, I stopped doing anything to better my mental health.

Recently, I dragged myself to my GP and told him that I wanted “to fix myself before I entered adulthood and start working”. He understood my concern, made a referral for me to visit a Psychiatrist at a local hospital and prescribed me Fluoxetine. This time, though, he started me at 20mg instead of my usual dose of 40mg.

Weeks went by and I don’t feel any better. I have increased urges of self harm. I feel entirely numb, and I cannot seem to cry to feel better (I do want to cry). My appetite has only be going downhill and I survive on only plain water and biscuits. My sleep schedule is so shit, I can either sleep for 16 hours or not at all. My psych appointment at the hospital isn’t until next month. I don’t know what to do now.

Anybody else on the same boat as I am? Has anyone switched from Fluoxetine to something else? In the meantime, stay safe everyone x"
depression,2020/04/18,"I think im dying (14F) I have been taking a lot of pills recently. For the past couple of months I have been taking 3-8 pills instead of only 1. I just started doing this and I dont know crap about pills. But I have insomnia, and cry a lot at night. I just want to sleep but the pills are not even helping. I think im dying. I can feel it. My breathing is messed up, im always dizzy, my legs shake when I walk, im always half conscious. I cant help but want to take more pills. Im suicidal, but I dont want to die like this, its hurts a lot. Its ADHD and sleeping medicine. Guanfacine and clonidine. Like I said before, I need help resisting taking so many because its killing me and it hurts a lot."
depression,2020/04/19,"I need advice. My(26F) husband(30M) doesn't seem to understand me. Time and time again I've told him I've been dealing with depression and anxiety. I've dropped hints, talked about wanting to go to therapy and maybe find a medication that might help me get back in a better mindset and get my motivation back. And yet I don't feel like he gets it. I know he is a good person and he cares for me but at the same time he is the only person that makes me feel bad about my current state of mind. I don't think he's intentionally trying to make me feel worse about myself but his little comments and lack of caring about how I'm feeling makes me feel worse. I've just had such a lack of motivation lately with everything. I haven't been taking care of myself or our house lately. I've been drinking more(I know we're quarantined but it's been this way for a little while), not eating the best and haven't gotten the motivation to clean around the house. I try to workout/do things around the house but it feels like a minute later I'm exhausted. My focus is all off. 
I know that isn't right but i feel he just sees it as me being lazy instead of realizing that I'm struggling. It's hard for me to talk about how I'm feeling but I have broken down about it in the past during small arguments. He has been in a depression before and I could always tell and I tried my best to comfort him during those times. I guess what I'm getting at is that I wish he was as receptive to how I'm feeling as I always am to him. Am I wrong for expecting him to pick up on the fact that I am struggling? Like I said, I even notice a difference in my own behavior and it's so hard to break through that. I just wish he would notice too and help me through it. Am I wrong for expecting that of him?

TL;DR I don't think my husband understands how I'm feeling. I need to know if my thinking on the situation is right. Could use advice on how to handle this."

depression,2020/04/20,"Covid-19 Sad boi hours Idk if this is the right one but back then I (19F) already decided that i wanted to seek help with my self-harming and depression (I’m not diagnosed so idk if I can even call it that ). I was planning on going to my university counseling services (cheaper bc university insurance and stuff) and tl;dr i didn’t get an email back for details about their services after many months of trying to get an appointment (I’m guessing they’re really packed and there’s a lot of students at my uni) and it really made me not want to apply there and now I’m more scared than ever to seek any professional help. Can I get some advice on where to even start when seeking help ? I live in Canada and due to Covid-19, I really don’t have a lot of options right now :^("
depression,07-28-2023,"I [26F] have struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life. I love passionately, and I put everything I am into my work, school, & relationships. 

Sometimes I feel too sensitive for the world. Like I wasn’t made to be an adult here. I love too hard too fast. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I open up easily to people who weaponize it against me. People are just rude or short in general. 

I’m so exhausted and lonely and sad. Being an adult feels so isolating. Even when I go out and meet people, it’s all so surface-level. The world is so unforgiving."
depression,07-27-2023,"I (24F) have been working on myself more lately. This includes trying to allow myself to become more emotional.

I’m currently at a road block where I just can’t cry though. I’ll get sad and might feel like I’m about to cry. But for some reason I won’t. I’m not trying to stop myself but maybe I’m missing something. Maybe I can’t get emotional enough? What do I do?"
depression,07-27-2023,"So I (19F) am a fucking idiot. I finally went in to see my GP for the first time since I was fifteen with the intent to just get diagnosed, get on medication, and move on with my life for fuck's sake. When given the questionnaire, I severely downplayed the ""hurting yourself?"" and ""better off dead?"" questions because I really didn't want to be sent to the psych ward. I have a job and I can't take the time off to get that kind of treatment.

My mother's a doctor, and she comes home and complains about how she gets these patients that treat their appointments like therapy sessions. I was worried that my doctor would do the same, and I felt this incredible urge to just lie lie lie and keep the conversation so jokey and upbeat. I never mentioned anything about my history with self-harm or how I spend every drive to work wishing I was brave enough to finally swerve into oncoming traffic. 

Anyway, I didn't meet the criteria for depression, which left me at a loss. I've never felt so invalid in my life. I've spent nineteen years listening to my mother tell me that it's just a phase and that there's nothing wrong with me, just to have her words clinically approved. I wanted this diagnosis to prove her wrong and to finally become a functioning member of society, but it really just did the opposite. I've never felt worse. I've wanted to die since I was ten years old, so this sadness is basically my identity. To have it discredited makes me feel like I'm alone in this feeling and that I'm never going to get better, because well, there's nothing wrong with me.

I'm planning on taking a mixture of 45mg of dayvigo, 290mg melatonin, and whatever's left in my tylenol-3 bottle with as much rum and vodka as I can stomach. I'm doing this on a week where I have the house to myself, closer to the end of the week and in the bathtub so clean up is a little easier. What do you think my chances of survival are? I really don't want to survive this."

19F. I’ve been diagnosed with depression for almost a year now, and I’m on sertraline. My actual diagnosis was major depression and moderate anxiety. However, I don’t know which type of depression I have. I basically go through episodes thst last anywhere between 2 weeks to a couple months. These episodes include not eating correctly, not being able to get out of bed, a “depression pit” and a period of not speaking to any of my friends or family. I don’t sleep well, and I lose motivation to do absolutely anything.This is accompanied with a constant feeling of numbness and a heavy feeling in my chest. When not in these episodes, I am quite anxious but otherwise fine. Can anyone help me to figure out which type of depression I have?

depression,07-26-2023,"CW/TW: self harm, substance abuse


I don’t really know where to begin. I [30F] have been in a really dark place for half a week now. A little backstory, I’ve suffered with depression for most of my life, was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen, diagnosed with BPD in my mid 20s, and believe I’ve got some undiagnosed neurodiversity. I grew up in a house were feelings were never talked about, sadness was ignored or belittled, and I’ve always felt incredibly lonely.

Over the weekend, I accidentally discovered my partner [35M] has a porn addiction. We’ve been together for getting close to a decade now. The closest I’ve ever gotten to finding out he has a PA was around our 1 year anniversary, I learnt that he was sexting role playing with someone on Instagram. To me, that was a huge betrayal of trust and we almost broke up. He convinced me that he would change, we went to couples therapy together, and I thought that we had moved past it all. Anyway; it turns out that while he was no longer an active participant in his addiction, he has still been on porn sites every single damn day. He seems to think that he has never outright lied to me about the porn stuff, but: we have been dealing with him having erectile dysfunction for a couple of years now and he never once thought to make the connection or talk to me about it, and at one point to try and help our sex life I had suggested that he read me something dirty that turns him on (as I knew he enjoyed reading porn, and he enjoys reading his favourite novels to me) but he completely dismissed it and made it seem like he no longer read any porn. I’ve become an absolute wreck. I thought I knew everything about him. I thought we were close enough that he could of come to me about anything and I would’ve been able to be there for him with very little judgement. And I’m still somewhat understanding - I’m empathetic to what he’s probably going through right now after he’s been caught out and the breakdown of our relationship. But he has hit so many triggering things for me.

At first it was just the hurt and betrayal of trust and rejection sensitivity. Feeling like I’m not enough, like I’m not good enough. And that’s then triggered a major depressive episode for me. I’ve only been able to sleep once I get so drunk and stoned I can barely function. I’ve self harmed again. And he’s given me space like I’ve asked for, but in the middle of a depressive episode, it has then triggered all my old abandonment issues. There was a point were I honestly felt like I was 14 again, in the middle of a breakdown and just needing some form of comfort, and hearing people in the other room who know how distressed I am, and they just ignore it. I’ve completely regressed from all the healthy techniques I’ve developed over the years, and am back to all my shitty ones. Every time he talks to me, it’s to tell me he’s “booked a doctors appointment” or he’s “deleted all the browser history” or spoken to a friend, or found support groups online, or unfollowed people on Instagram. He hasn’t once asked how I’m feeling. How my mental health is handling everything. He has not checked in on me, but seems to expect my support to him. I feel so fucking lonely. I‘be never known how to sit in these awful feelings. I’ve reached out to one friend, and it was helpful to have someone validate my hurt and my feelings, but the day to day isolation is a lot. It’s just him, my cat, and myself in our house. All my friends and family live a fair drive away (and I don’t drive); and even if they didn’t, I don’t know how to really reach out for help. Or how to lean on anyone. I’ve only had two shifts of work, so I’ve felt really stuck in this house. I keep wanting to go out for a walk or something, but instead I can’t move, I’m just smoking and drinking and watching Gilmore Girls (which was a huge comfort show for me growing up).

I don’t really know why I’m posting here; I think I just need to get stuff out of my head."
depression,07-26-2023,"I’m 23F and was diagnosed with depression last year after I felt betrayed by one of my friends. I was on my last year of university and was supposedly going to graduate this year but I had to take a leave of absence when I attempted and was brought to the hospital for overdosing. After a year of staying at home, trying to focus on my mental health, I thought I was ready to go back to university and finish my last year of nursing school but now, I feel scared at the thought of making new friends and socializing. I can’t even imagine myself as a nurse once I do get to graduate. I feel like my life will short. I actually have a loving family, friends, and a boyfriend but I can’t see myself getting better nor do I see myself with a future. I feel like I’m going back to university for the sake of just getting a degree, not because I want to go back. I honestly don’t have any ambitions or motivation to live anymore."
depression,07-26-2023,"As the title says, I’m (27F) just so tired. For the entirety of my life I have felt sad, and weird, and awkward, and on the outside of everything. I’m the last resort friend, the one who’s invite gets forgotten and who’s text doesn’t get responded to. I’m good enough when people need help moving, or to vent, or any kind of time you need someone reliable but still, I’m only just barely good enough then. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember. 

 I’ve never truly belonged anywhere or been good at anything. I’m an adult and I feel so far behind my peers and people younger than me. I don’t have any money, any motivation, and not a single person I could really confide in and feel like they would care. I feel like a massive loser, like the weirdest bug under a microscope that everyone can see and point and laugh at. Being perceived in my daily life makes my skin crawl and the happiest I am is hiding in my apartment, reading or watching something I’ve read or watched dozens of times before because I know it’s safe and won’t hurt or disappoint me.

 I’ve ruined so many things for myself in the past and now I’m just a sad husk of a woman in her late 20s, completely and utterly exhausted by everything. I don’t feel like it will ever get better and now I’m just a weird stranger over sharing on the internet. I’m a void of untouched potential, apologizing for everything I do because existence is so painful and awkward and embarrassing. I just had to say it (or write it, I guess) out loud for once."
depression,07-25-2023,"I (26F) have 4 friends in my life. All 4 have done well in life so far. Great paying jobs, low debt, all 4 own homes, all 4 are getting married soon, all 4 travel (Hawaii, Thailand, Japan).

Then there’s me. My job is horribly paid. I have no degree (unlike my 4 friends) so it’s hard to make anymore money. I have loads of debt from idiotic younger choices. (Paying it off but it’s made my life miserable). I hate seeing them happy. I hate when I text about how stressed I am and they reply oh no sorry to hear that but guess what we are going to Cabo for vacation next month, isn’t that great?

I’m bitter. I’m a total miserable bitch. And I know it. But what am I supposed to do? Dance, cheer, and congratulate those around me while I suffer working 10 hours a day for nothing? Paying rent that’s too high, while they’re all home buyers… 

I’d be depressed even if I were rich I’m sure but lately my economic status has been dragging me down into the fucking dumps. 

I can’t even afford therapy. (Yay america) I fucking hate this shit"
depression,07-25-2023,"Alright so I've (18F)  basically always been depressed as long as I can remember basically. Every year it feels like it gets worse. I just don't see a way out of my slow depressive spiral. 

For context I'm not really sure why I'm depressed which sucks. My best guess is that I am chronically lonely; I have had absolutely no friends since I was in Elementary School and since I graduated High School not even acquaintances and I hate it but I don't blame people. I'm super boring to be around. The only time my social life looked like it might actually start existing then COVID took that and so much away from me. I think god/the universe just hate me (idfk what is out there).

Another reason I thought I was depressed is gender dysphoria. I'm trans and I absolutely just hate my body and while my parents have been accepting a lot of my family sucks and I live in a pretty conservative city. I was able to start getting medication for transitioning but since starting I've felt happier but I don't think it's really helping my depression at all.

At this point I'm just starting to give up and I have no energy. I just don't see myself ever getting better and I feel like I'm behind so many people my age on starting my life. I have no job largely because I'm scared people will not hire me because I'm Trans even though that'd be illegal in my country or because of a million reasons my anxiety cooks up for why I can't apply for a job. I'm pretty broke and I live with my parents, I'm such a disappointment. I haven't put any effort into creating a social or dating life because I don't feel like I deserve it. It just feels like I'm incapable of helping myself. I've had thoughts about ending my life which sucks and has only made my self sabatoge worse because I keep telling myself there's no point renewing my driver's license or doing a multitude of other things because I might not even live much longer anyway."
depression,07-25-2023,"
17F | I know this might be more accurate to have posted this on the trauma subreddit but it won’t let me. I became very depressed and basically stopped living my life when I was 14. I haven’t really left the house since. I’m homeschooled and don’t have friends or anything. I’m getting better now but I think I might have stunted my growth or something. Guys my age look too old for me. Girls my age look way older then I feel I am. I see them online and still think of them like ""older girls"".
I FEEL more mature and I’m trying to accept adulthood as it’s coming but I still get sad sometimes. However the part I’m most concerned about is the fact that I don’t know if I’m attracted to men my own age or want to hangout with girls my age. If guys my age look ""too old"" what if I’m still attracted to 14 year olds? I have no interaction with either so I can’t really confirm my theory/ anxiety but I hope so much that I’m wrong. Can I fix that if it is the case? I really don’t want to be like that. 
Just to add: I WOULD NEVER date a 14 year old. I know that’s inappropriate and wrong. I’m not attracted to their maturity either."
depression,07-25-2023,"Hello All I (24M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for 7 months and they have been the most magical 7 months of my life. I deal with severe anxiety, health anxiety, panic disorder and PTSD and my gf has been very very helpful and supportive through my tough times and I love her dearly. She has been the best thing to ever happen to me in my life and I love her to death and want to start a family with her. Unfortunately one day early last week I woke up and I felt as if all my love and feelings had disappeared out of the blue. Nothing happened between us and I am struggling with this ideology my brain has come up with. It’s like when I look at her I don’t feel the love or butterflies I did two weeks ago. Now for reference it feels this way with almost everyone in my life at the moment, including my mom, my dad, my love for cars, video games you name it. But this issue with my girlfriend has caused me to breakdown crying everyday because I don’t want to lose her like my mind is telling me to. I have been on Lexapro for 4 months now and at the same time I started omprezalone for GERD. Last Monday a day or two before these thoughts started my med lady switched me to protonix stomach meds and kept the Lexapro the same. She also had me taking almost 1000 mg of magnesium every day and 2000 IU of Vitamin D. My question is has anyone experienced this before and how did you overcome this ?? My therapist believes it is depression getting the better of me and that the new stomach meds I am on are causing a bad reaction. Please give me hope I want to marry this girl."
depression,07-25-2023,"Hi! I (18F) have had depression for many years. My depression manifests in a lot of different ways, but mainly sever insomnia (the kind where you sleep too much, not too little) and low motivation. I always have a classic depression room, I will go a couple days without showering even if I feel dirty etc. The room and the showering are a little easier to convince myself to do because I notice if I don’t do them. However, brushing my teeth is a habit I never formed. The problem is I don’t really notice that I don’t do it often, and no one else says anything. I go to college in the fall and maybe it will help to have a roommate who I see going and brushing her teeth? But I can’t be sure that will work, help!!"
