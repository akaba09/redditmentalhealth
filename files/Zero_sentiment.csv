2,depression,2019-10-08,not sure if i am depressed burnt out or if society just sucks f i dont know what my problem is lately i think i am just stressed and burnt out and depressed i dont even know where to start i worry by throwing all this out there i will just seem like a millennial brat or something if this post is too long or something is wrong with my question or presentation let me know relationship and living situation right now i live with my boyfriend renting a two family flat in a midwestern us city we have four cats and a dog that i adore our relationship is good in some ways however our issues in my eyes are that i dont feel a spiritual deep connection or understanding with him like i would like to he has a few addictions like porn and weed sometimes i feel like i want him to be different than he feels he is like i dont want him to dye his hair crazy colors or wear kilts or other different fashion and he is mostly interested in television celebrity actors and games while i could care less i spend my free time on going to yoga doing chores maybe watching a show seeing my friend hiking he does run a lot and is struggling to find things to do in his free time he can also be kind of lazy and messy and i take control of all the cleaning bill paying meal planning etc he is a cook and went to school for it but doesnt seem to really have a passion for it i think i expect too much however as i feel i want a soul connection with a man but i dont think ill actually find that work i work a bit more than full time in customer service in the automotive industry weekdays mainly i take about calls a day and process orders etc i have been here three years before this i worked in food service they like me here and told me they consider me management material possibly and are gearing me in that direction however i dont really want the job though i thought i might a while ago customer service is irritating and lately i have been so irritable at work i hate answering calls with the same questions all the time i hate working inside all day in some ways i dont care about the auto industry my coworkers are usually pretty sweet but i just feel so irritable with everything about work school i am also going to school four hours per week doing an accelerated degree program in corporate communications ill be done by summer  i forgot why i even started this program i had an associates in general transfer studies and felt i needed to finish my bachelors and picked a program that sounded interesting i do like the material however my managers think im best in customer service and think marketing is not right for me since i am shy and quiet and not charismatic i dont know what im going to do with my degree i just figured it would get me somewhere

about the culture and find it so beautiful i am sad we ever destroyed their culture i love their spiritual ways of living connection with the earth community and family values everything i am probably romanticizing it all but ive just been researching and am sad i wasnt born in a time where that kind of organic life was something i could live i am an infp personality type and feel deeply unfulfilled living this rat race materialistic lonely depressing boxed in life i dont think it is a personal problem but a societal problem i have been dreaming of a life where i could live away from the city not work my life away in an office live in nature but i bet it would be lonely idk ive had thoughts like this before about wanting to escape the regular society just fantasizing and i probably sound like a teenager right now i just want to live a whole life raise strong and healthy children not contribute to destroying the beautiful planet were on health i recently lost lbs through

eating disorder ive become ocd about counting calories weighing food constantly on my fitness pal lately i go over calories and binge on fast food and have gained about pounds i obsess about my bodily flaws and the fact that i am aging and there are way more beautiful women out there i pinch my fat and hate it i regret ever getting fat and dont even know how i wasnt aware of how big i was getting i unhealthily blame my upbringing for not teaching me healthy habits my family all smokes so many cigarettes dont exercise eat lots of fast food i was going to try to assume a deficit today but went way overboard at starbucks and dairy queen i talked to my dietician friend and she suggested intuitive eating my life has revolved around calorie counting however lately ive been obsessing over how society sucks and gave me this eating disorder self esteem and body image issues i know i should not blame family background i grew up living with my dad as my parents were divorced before my birth my

for and trauma issues for im on medication for anxiety and depression ive made it a priority to take care of myself so i dont irritate the shit out of others like i did during the worst part of my depression and i go to therapy as much as possible along with lowering expectations for school social life etc ive been on the upswing for about five months during this time period everyone around me has gone to shit roommate friends from high school family members when i say everyone i literally mean everyone so im trying to help everyone else around me while not letting myself get bogged down by it because im trying to prioritize myself for the first time in my life im also still suffering from fatigue and emotional and mental burnout but im still a hell of a lot better than i was a few months ago amp x b now my roommate shes in the same year as me different major she was diagnosed with depression a while back but lost a family member a few months back and things started going downhill ive been encouraging her to get help for about six months and she hasnt complied or if she has its barely now i knew she was in a bad mood for the first few weeks of the semester and then i managed to clarify that it was depression then a few months back she started not finishing all of her meals i know this because im the cook this has been going on for at least two months im not trying to be harsh but if she was a full blown anorexic i would have noticed weight loss shes overweight and there has been no change in how she looks i caught her once hiding and eating a cookie i pretended not to notice it is entirely possible she is in a binge restrict cycle but there havent been physical signs so i cant tell she has had some bad times with alcohol going way too overboard and ive had to take care of her the past few days shes refused to eat any actual meals this all probably sounds incredibly selfish but this is also damaging my own well being and is creating a toxic and negative environment in my room and im really trying not to backslide on the progress ive made because its been damn hard and i really do not have to start from square one again its a fear of mine amp x b i care about her were not super close but i obviously want her to be healthy i just cant care for her  i spend a lot of my time making sure she does things like go to therapy emails professors feeds herself takes care of minor injuries and not let them get infected and basically i feel like im babysitting and i just cannot maintain this for another semester i want her to feel better but im feeling whiny and i wish i didnt have to bear the burden because shell only talk to me and no one else which doesnt seem fair to me i offer her logical solutions to her problems and she says that im right but doesnt do the smart thing i listen and offer sympathy and let her rant but the rants never stop whats worse to me is that she acknowledges she has a problem but will do jack shit about it herself and i get that its not entirely her fault but it is extremely aggravating for me to deal with she has barely eaten that i have seen the past six days and im worried that she will self harm in a more dangerous and immediate way yes i know not eating is not good for you but it takes longer for fatal effects to occur if i had known this was going to be the way my life was i would not have

therapists i googled i asked family i asked friends im on mg a day anti depressants plus mg anti anxieties i take a multivitamin daily iron tablet daily because im anemic i drink water i exercise i do those things to make sure theyre eliminated factors to why im completely broken im f my husband of one year has left to go find himself he is a well accomplished good looking man with a strong foothold in his career he messages occasionally to say he misses me he even went as far to ask to meet up this weekend but i know that i wont hear from him for a few weeks again my little year old has had psychological testing because he wasnt responding well to authoritive figures at school he received diagnosis of having elevated emotional receptors otherwise all learning fuctions and wellbeing are normal he is the most sweetest intelligent loving and funny kid i know his father not my husband has always been more like a big brother he picks and chooses when to have him and as long as my boy is happy it is fine three weeks ago my little boy didnt listen to his father and got hurt not badly but still enough for there to be a bruise on his leg this led to social services contacting his father and his father obviously contacting me in a upset manner there is definitely a related reason as to why we havent been together for years still managed to make co parenting work peacefully i use quotations because i have our child fulltime but letting his dad go around saying he shares equal responsibility even after he has only been to our childs school a handful of times has never applied with him for sports teams never been to the dentist with him you get the picture its just easier my boy loves him and i feel one day he will decide on his own but i am on high alert and being kind and friendly every time we saw each other my father is an alcoholic has been since before i was born the abuse began early as it was carried on from my mother and elder sister except mine ended up being physical mother never removed me from situations almost always had to either forget or receive an apology from me to him for what he did one example being i wouldve been around the same age as my little one i was asleep in bed dad worked lates he came home i guess around midnight drunk came into my room and started yelling i just remember a whole bunch of shouting i dont recall any words and then he punched a hole in my wall and walked out neither parent came back to my room that night i got up turned out the light and went back to bed i dont remember if i slept i remember that i cried i remember no one cared that night that day i even recall my mother telling me numerous times to get over it my parents are now theyre old fragile and very different i love them they love their grandbabies and treat then soo soo differently i study right now especially from my husband leaving i want to ensure that my kid has the right future with love kindness and knowing how to respect others in saying that im not a man hater im assuming i picked wrong due to childhood influence i thought my husband loved me he never abused me he never yelled at me he was great with my little one he just dosent want us anymore my bestfriend tried to commit suicide lastweek this is a snippit glimpse tiny portion of my life ive written here i have to get back to study as i have deadlines and im pushing through to be able to provide independently but i shake everyday i cry everyday i cant breathe everyday and i know how to deal with that now my littlw boy never sees or feels my hurt i make

20,depression,2019-08-04, youre just looking for a reason to be upset its been a dark couple of months i just cant seem to shake the depression that has me in its grip ive been struggling for the past year even with medication i keep wondering when the sun will shine on me again if it ever will our family me f and my husband m and our children recently moved to a new house it was a difficult move with a lot of stress but things have smoothed out we left a busy suburban area and moved to a rural area with a beautiful view from each window even in my dark times staring out the window seems to help connect me to the life going on around me watching the birds hopping around the yard and the expanse of lush green grass its not much but it calms me it reels me back in i dont know why i recently came home to a large rv recreational vehicle parked at our house it turns out our friends were in a bind and needed somewhere to park it for awhile my husband agreed to let them park it at our house with no real timeline established about when it would be moved i adore our friends and dont have a problem with helping them out except that i was dismayed to find out that the views from the windows inside my house are now obstructed by the rv no more birds to be seen no more butterflies or bees buzzing around the yard no more yard just a big ugly rv its disheartening but temporary i guess i asked my husband if our friends could move the rv to a different spot somewhere in the yard that didnt obstruct the view he thinks im making a big deal about nothing im certainly not trying to make anything a big deal but looking out the window was one of the safe things i could rely on while being inside the house i still yearn to be able to watch nature happening outside while im busy inside with chores instead of being sensitive or understanding my husband accused me of using the rv issue as a reason to be upset as if i want to be upset about something for a guy who has lived with me for almost years i didnt think it was possible to understand me any less i dont even see you looking out any windows ever he said you never look out the windows youre just looking for a reason to be upset so now im upset and feeling worse because of this stupid depression that wont go away i just wanted to watch the birds outside the windows i guess its a big deal to move the rv because there has to be a special truck to move it and who knows what else i dont want to be the asshole to bring it up to my friends to move their rv i will try to hang in there i completely withdrew myself today slammed the baby food down and ran crying to my room why the hell would any depressed person make up an additional reason to be upset arent we already upset about things the obstruction of my view outside the window is a very real thing to me it means a lot to me to be able to see out the window and i guess i am crazy for being upset about it but whats new now im back in a dark place inside

always been very enabling of his addictions and very poor life choices so when i decided to cut him out of my life they did not see it my way in fact the last time he relapsed my parents started treating me poorly and chose him over me for family events as i was the one who was being unreasonable when he passed away i obviously was devastated i always held onto hope that he would get back on his meds and stop self medicating with illegal drugs my parents and extended family were crushed by his death my parents always hid his addictions and mental illness from family and friends so i was left being the one explaining to family how bad things were and how he was a bipolar addict yes we tried numerous times to get him help k worth of private rehab later he just became better at manipulating people i held it together as best i could since my parents were destroyed by his passing it took me about a year to get back into my life routine and accept he was gone part of why it took a year is because my parents guilted me into doing so many things with them during that year i live hours away from them but it was always expected id drive up for anything remotely family related this really impacted my job life so after a year i decided no more and started telling them no now its been years since his passing but whenever i see my parents its like it only happened a month ago i started to dread seeing them because they try to pull me down into their vortex of grief and sadness it would take me a few days after seeing them to get back to my usual happiness level and shake off their depression im not sure if seeing me just reminds them that hes gone or maybe theyre always this way now either way i cant continue like this i love my parents and want to see them but its too much how can i navigate this situation should i be upfront and just tell them that their negative attitude every time i see them affects me strongly and thats why im avoiding them or should i continue to just ignore it and blame being busy with work for why i only see them every few months now tl dr parents are devastated by my brothers death their grief is still so strong years

end of the year my high school results were nowhere near my expectations throughout school i did get into a bachelors though but then i had no idea what to choose as a major or what i wanted to do in life it doesnt help that my father has very high expectations for me and wants me to become a doctor lawyer throughout the application process he was silent while i needed guidance but once i randomly chose my subjects and finalised enrollment he ranted and screamed at me for being a disappointment lazy for choosing something that wouldnt land me a job i live by myself now for university and although i have friends from high school i find it hard to connect with them and it feels as if i am wearing a mask when im communicating with them i feel guilty for not being sincere with them but i know that i shouldnt burden them with my real self i also have a hard time making friends in my classes so when classes end i go home and go to sleep i sleep for hours every night ill have hour after noon naps as well on weekends i spend most of the day sleeping or lying in bed watching videos im severely depressed because i feel as if i have no direction in life the course ive chosen doesnt

63,depression,2019-02-11,my f girlfriend cheated on me m with multiple people at school feels like a nuke went off inside me ive been a wreck since ack story i am and live and work on long island my now ex gf is year old junior who goes to school in suny albany my now ex gf and i have known each other for many years our families are very close with each other she and i have been hooking up on and off for the past few years and have always liked each other we didnt date at first because she was still in high school and i was in college plus the age difference i never loved anyone like this girl and couldnt believe i could like someone so much and be under their spell our official relationship began over the summer near the end of july we rarely fought and had great sex and our families were very happy we were finally together weve talked for many years about getting married and having kids however there were some red flags that i ignored early on because i was in such love with her she constantly talked about her ex boyfriends matt v and garry matt p and noah she went to school with and it kinda annoyed me if even looked at another girls snap or instagram story who was just a friend from high school she would flip out and me she was made me not use social media around her such as instagram unless i posted photos with her and delete all girls even friends off my snapchat and phone contacts she also made me also stop hanging out and talking with one of my best friends who was a girl who was basically my sister i agreed to all this because i loved her and was under her spell while i would post her on my social media such as facebook and instagram she did not put up a single post of me not to brag but she would post up pictures with my fathers nice cars and summer home but none with me ever i asked her why she didnt post me on social media shes like im gonna wait to the school semi formal to post you and no one has to know my business she also is going through lots of difficulty with her family her father used to be a major lawyer but now is a struggling drug addict in and out of jail her mother is struggling to make ends meat to send her and her sister to school and pay her mortgage i know this a bad situation but she would use it against me to get her way always with things and turn a blind eye to her childish behavior when she left for school in late august i felt everything was fine with our relationship we shared each other locations so i know where she was she is president of her sorority and would go to lots of fraternity parties and mixers on weekends most nights her location showed she made it back home other nights she would sleep downtown were the parties where i bought up my concern to her once she said she slept at her roommates cousins johnnys house i joked saying did you sleep on the couch and she got mad at me saying she needed space for the rest of the day i didnt ask her again when she slept downtown because i didnt wanna anger her more another night she posted a snapchat story of her kissing a guy on the cheek this upset me i told her to take it down she told me she wanted space again and called me controlling one night i was facetiming her late at night and one of her ex boyfriends matt v hits her up to have sex and come over i tell her to tell him she is dating me and to tell him to get lost shes like i dont wanna be that girl who tells everyone i have a boyfriend and she told me not to worry shes done with him later one that night i check her location because i had my suspicions and she was not at her apartment i checked she was at a upper class man and grad student housing complex i then call her and she didnt answer and she freaked out on me she made up the excuse she was visiting her little sister who was having an anxiety attack and didnt wanna be at school but i also had her sisters location on snap maps and she was at her freshman dorm miles away when i calculated the distance on google maps my girlfriend told me her ex boyfriend matt v lived at another student housing complex on the other side of campus and i was acting crazy and didnt trust her she got her sister to lie and tell me my girlfriend was visiting her at the dorm when she was really with matt v she wanted space from me for the next days and didnt start talking to me again until i got her sister from the train on long island and took her home my girlfriend came home towards the end of september for her sisters boyfriends father party and it was clear going to back to school changed her alot she felt like she was better and cooler than me in some way and was acting suspicious at the party she went upstairs at one point and saw her taking selfies in the mirror i grab her phone and saw that on her snapchat she was frequently sending snaps to this guy george who i knew she had a thing with she made up the excuse that he was gay and she didnt speak to me for the rest of the party we had sex later

mind your own business this brought back memories from when i was about my mom accusing me that my behaviour wasnt normal that i was depressed and her solution was to take me to some random doctor to prescribe me some meds without actually diagnosing me and i never took them she has depression and anxiety herself she treats it with meds alone because she doesnt believe in therapy i love her and i

79,depression,2019-06-13,asking for virtual hugs i f have felt pretty lonely for quite a while in high school it was a socially isolated kinda loneliness i was the book smart nerdy girl who dedicated all her time to getting straight as to satisfy a deeply rooted need for perfection and mask the fact that i didnt have a real friend group or social life i wanted one but i didnt feel like i connected with people it didnt help that social interactions exhausted me i remember coming home from a friends house one day and just crying junior senior year this got a little better especially when i pushed my way into those cliche rebellious teen activities drinking and smoking with my peers made me feel like one of them not in a peer pressure way just in a breaking out of my comfort zone kinda way i also developed some friendships a bit more last fall i started college and shit took a turn for the worst i felt so isolated and spent a lot of time on my dorm bed too depressed to move i started sneaking sips of vodka here and there there were a lot of factors to my depression including some grief and trauma but the loneliness was by far the worst part things got bad and then almost too bad but i managed to get on ssris over fall break going into spring semester aided by lexapro i decided to take charge and try new things like many young women i have a pretty complicated relationship with my body for a pretty long time i really beleived that no man would ever be interested in me sexually like i viewed myself as some sort of atrocity these body image issues coupled with a reputation as the not super social book smart girl kept me from being sexually active in high school come spring semester i did the obvious thing and downloaded tinder dont get me wrong im really fucking horny all the time and thats a big reason ive been having a lot of casual sex but theres other reasons as well its nice just to be in someones arms really cuddling fucking rocks but i still feel lonely afterwards because of how casual it all is my hookups whether one time or ongoing have all been with college seniors and sometimes even with guys a bit older so obviously nothing serious has come of any of these even though ive sometimes felt feelings i find i feel loneliest when i think about whether or not these guys actually appreciate my company or just see me as a body its funny because i never thought this would end up being a concern because i couldnt fathom that men would be attracted to me after years of hating my body learning that i can be attractive and even sexy just feels so exciting ive even gotten pretty into sending nudes in the absence of actual emotional connection ive become kinda an attention whore i guess the summary of this cluster fuck of a paragraph is that casual sex reminds me of my loneliness but i keep doing it because a im horny and b it makes me temporarily less lonely sex life aside spring semester was more socially fulfilling than fall i got much closer to two of the guys on my hall and i feel comfortable opening up to them not in quite this much detail but they know much more about my life than most people and thats been pretty nice but even with them i still feel lonely all the time like i could be sitting with them spilling my deepest shit and feel completely alone so fast forward to right now here i am alone in my house while my parents away meowing back and forth with my cat please send virtual hugs ,pre,female,asking for virtual hugs i f have felt pretty lonely for quite a while in high school it was a socially isolated kinda loneliness i was the book smart nerdy girl who dedicated all her time to getting straight as to satisfy a deeply rooted need for perfection and mask the fact that i didnt have a real friend group or social life i wanted one but i didnt feel like i connected with people it didnt help that social interactions exhausted me i remember coming home from a friends house one day and just crying junior senior year this got a little better especially when i pushed my way into those cliche rebellious teen activities drinking and smoking with my peers made me feel like one of them not in a peer pressure way just in a breaking out of my comfort zone kinda way i also developed some friendships a bit more last fall i started college and shit took a turn for the worst i felt so isolated and spent a lot of time on my dorm bed too depressed to move i started sneaking sips of vodka here and there there were a lot of factors to my depression including some grief and trauma but the loneliness

honestly it gives me chills thinking about it there was a social worker in the room the entire time i guess this is required by law since they assumed it was a suicide attempt and i later learned from the doctor that my blood alcohol content was a when i got to the er when i was still intoxicated i guess i had told them i had taken pills too although the drug screening didnt pick up anything for some reason and after a lot of persuasion on my end they actually didnt me and ended up discharging me that night probably a poor decision but i just really wanted to go home but the medical record discharge paper i left with which is still on my nightstand haunts me they marked the reason for my visit as suicidal ideation and alcohol and benzodiazepine abuse it technically was an overdose

awesome sex life best friends in general as the time went by he was opening more and more about his past very abusive childhood was left alone at the very early age money struggles etc and he admitted to suffer from depression he has been diagnosed by a professional but not taking any medication or going to therapies i noticed that he had some pretty bad days sometimes when he would close himself in his apartment and wouldnt answer my calls messages or door rings few days later he would just appear out of nowhere like nothing happened and we would go on with our lives i always tried to talk to him about it but he always refused he would even go home from our meeting if i was too pushy but it was happening about once in two months and after that we could function normally i guessed he just needed some time alone sometimes to clear his head and relax after a year or so those periods become more frequent like twice a month our relationship was still the same love birds but had sex only once in a month tried to talk to him but refused and blamed it on stress things were getting worse but he stopped closing himself in and instead just started telling me he feels bad or very bad i tried to take most of his daily tasks off of his back like cooking making appointments paying bills etc so he would feel less stressed about daily life now after years since we met we barely talk

gotten to combat my mental health is to push through it but its the one thing i just cannot do as much as i try once i start panicking its game over and then i get extremely upset with myself for

my mum told me today and many other days before that she cant keep going on like this and she cant cope with me anymore and im too dependent on her which i am but its out of an irrational fear of her dying so i try and spend time with her and turn it into a positive one of my friends often call to the house for a chat which i thought was nice but i found out that she only does that to see if im ok

98,depression,2019-03-02,i started taking antidepressants weeks ago im experiencing some very weird symptoms and my depression has gone into overdrive tw suicide self harm i dont know if this is the right place to post this i know subs dedicated to antidepressants and ssris exist but i dont know if theyre very active and im feeling kind of desperate here im f and ive had depression and anxiety since i was  my parents were against medicating me as a kid but when i turned i decided i wanted to try it so weeks ago my doctor prescribed me mg of citalopram my first ever ssri or any psychiatric drug i spoke to my doctor and due to having a history of sleep problems he told me to take it every morning during the first week i experienced some side effects that were annoying but tolerable mild nausea shakiness sleep disturbance appetite loss afternoon fatigue etc these side effects have mostly gone away aside from the sleep disturbance and fatigue although i knew it was a too early to tell by the end of the first week i was beginning to feel a little better however i think that was mainly due to feeling good about starting treatment towards the end of the second week however things took a turn for the worst ill put things into dot points to make it easier to read my depression has reappeared but its a different kind of depression now the sadness feels different i feel incredibly detached from myself i feel like my personality has changed im more apathetic than i was before and my sense of humour has pretty much vanished my reactions to things are also off as well i feel like im detached and disconnected and its like im not the one experiencing these events ive experienced depersonalisation and derealisation before so maybe its that but i just dont know anymore im not interested in anything going on around me anymore my creativity is gone i used to daydream almost constantly but now i cant do that anymore it just doesnt work its like trying to have an imaginary friend like i did when i was a child that magic or ability just isnt there anymore i felt suicidal before medicating and i feel suicidal again now but its a different kind of suicidal before i wanted to die and was completely fine with the concept of being dead now the suicidal feelings are even stronger except the idea of being a corpse is horrifying the ambivalence is maddening i also keep imagining my suicide in my head which i did before medicating but the images have gotten progressively more violent on a similar note i have started cutting im ashamed to admit it but fuck it this is anonymous and im using a throwaway so whatever the cuts arent that deep just yet but i can feel myself falling into the self harming trap i just have no idea how else im meant to release this new horrible feeling i have inside i used to drink when things would get really bad but for some reason im now drawn to cutting i also imagine cutting deeper and what that would look like its messed up i know i keep freaking out about the concepts of death the potential of an afterlife gods the universe etc i feel like my head is spinning sometimes i keep feeling really hot at night im usually always cold so this one is really weird i really really hate being around people now my depression has caused me to isolate myself a lot at times except i still used to have somewhat of a longing to have relationships and be around others that has completely disappeared i suddenly cant stand being around people anymore and the thought of interacting with others makes me feel incredibly mad i try not to express these feelings because i dont want to be a terrible person or hurt people but i cant help but feel this way every single person seems to get on my nerves now has anybody experienced any of these symptoms when starting an ssri for the first time if so did the symptom s go away are they a sign that my body is not tolerating the medicine im going to bring these up to my doctor when i see him in a few weeks but i guess im just posting to gage how extreme my reaction to the medicine is there are a few other things too but this is already way too long so ill leave it at that for now

witch made me happy in the end shutting them up few years later i married my high school sweet heart and became pregnant with my daughter after my daughter was born fast forward march early in the

to take care of my self i dont even have stretch marks from my pregnancy finding that out i punched him in the smirk face in front of his mother i hit postpartum depression with out knowing i had no one helping me besides staying at my mothers house but i was paying rent and my mother belittlering me every time she gets the chance i somehow stop taking care of my daughter and she end up hurting her self somehow witch i cant seem to figure out how but she ended up with a minor skull fracture that cps got involve interviewed all my family and his and decided to take her away from me and temporarily gave her to her father ex husband to monitor my behavior with her when he was the one who left us and rejected to help when i found out she had a bump on her head calling him to take us to the hospital and him replaying with why cant your mom or brother take you im at the pool with my friends click after i got my daughter back and taking parenting classes and all i started getting stronger and ignoring that i had anything wrong with me mentally around somehow depression anxiety started creeping up on me but i always thought that it was just because i had a hard day at work ect ect in my depression hit and hit bad not only that i started gaining weight slowly but surely i notice i gained a few pounds and the more weight i gained the more depressed i got through out that time

long as i can remember ive suffered with chronic illness and chronic pain for those who are unsure this is illness and pain which has carried on for an extended period of time usually more than a few weeks in my case years recently i have been actively trying to find the cause of my health issues but unfortunately have come up blank again and again i am now being sent to a rheumatologist for arthritis and auto immune disease its becoming difficult to go to the doctor as im terrified of the outcome and there is no motivation behind getting better because it seems impossible im finding an increase in my anxiety which was usually only in social situations i now feel anxious  i think its mostly because of the uncertainty of whats wrong with me and if it is an auto immune disease arthritis ive seen how much they affect peoples lives and i dont want the rest of my life to be pain and medications and then i get anxious that maybe my partner m will get sick of me im always tired my mood swings are hectic and my sex drive has virtually vanished he tells me he doesnt care about sex and i want to believe him but its just so hard considering hes only as well i feel like im making his life stressful and he is missing out on so much as much as i dont want to i get incredibly jealous when he talks to a female friend or chooses his hobbies over spending time with me i dont want to feel like this because then i cause arguments and he thinks i dont trust him i feel his frustration all the time which just makes me more anxious and depressed that he wants to leave but feels bad for doing so sometimes i wonder if i should just leave so he can be with someone fit healthy and ready to live i know he doesnt want to leave me and this is just the voice in my head telling me these things but its so hard to fight it i feel so alone i dont have any motivation to do anything i love art but cant find the right head space to do it it just feels as if theres no point i dont want to

142,depression,2020-01-10,a question about what is normal wall of text alert hey so im f soon to be and i have a problem ive been on winter break for some time and i feel like im always missing out my friends dont ask me to hang out that much though they are probably busy most of the time with work i have work too but its less hours than most of them i know that i could easily text them and say hey lets hang out its very simple and yet for some reason i dont do it even when im back at college i actually go for months without seeing my friend group although i do talk to my fellow classmates and we study together and have some laughs some of the time i am satisfied by this and dont feel lonely but other times i feel alone and hurting even though i am very close to my parents and we do hang out a lot when i do hang out with them for a birthday party or a big get together im usually happy although admittedly i do feel out of place sometimes since i feel like they are all different than me despite being happy i never initiate hangouts because i never feel like i want to and it almost feels uncomfortable and this makes me feel like a really shitty friend since when we do hang out sometimes i dont know whats going on in their lives i dont text them much either i tell this to my parents and they always try their best to help but i know i need to work on this on my own and stop depending on them something i do far to often probably because of my low self esteem i always tell them the same problems over and over hoping they can fix it but i know deep down that i need to do that on my own and when they get frustrated at me for bugging them about the same things i get mad at them and snap i feel like ive been snapping more and more often as of late and now i feel like the worst daughter too i just want to be a good person and i try for others but not enough for myself i cant help feeling that ive wasted my life already i used to feel amazing in middle school i had a hobby swimming and close friends and everything but in high school i started to feel more distant and left out from them my depression and anxiety got worse and now its still there though not as bad as it was in high school i always feel like im wasting my time doing things that i dont even know if i truly enjoy and i know i like certain hobbies like swimming and ice skating but for some reason i just stay in the house and dont do much but watch anime play video games watch youtube which i feel has become a bad addition and read i know doing other things is out of my comfort zone but i need to try something i am sorry for the long post but i feel like i need to get my life back on track before it is too late and i have no life left to live im always afraid of losing time its a huge problem of mine thank you guys so much if you read all of this i love you ,post,female,a question about what is normal wall of text alert hey so im f soon to be and i have a problem ive been on winter break for some time and i feel like im always missing out my friends dont ask me to hang out that much though they are probably busy most of the time with work i have work too but its less hours than most of them i know that i could easily text them and say hey lets hang out its very simple and yet for some reason i dont do it even when im back at college i actually go for months without seeing my friend group although i do talk to my fellow classmates and we study together and have some laughs some of the time i am satisfied by this and dont feel lonely but other times i feel alone and hurting even though i am very close to my parents and we do hang out a lot when i do hang out with them for a birthday party or a big get together im usually happy although admittedly i do feel out of place sometimes since i feel like they are all different than me despite being happy i never initiate hangouts because i never feel like i want to and it almost feels uncomfortable and this makes me feel like a really shitty friend since when we do hang out sometimes i dont know whats going on in their lives i dont text them much either i tell this to my parents and they always try their best to help but i know i need to work on this on my own and stop depending on them something i do far to often probably because of my low self esteem i always tell them the same problems over and over hoping they can fix it but i know deep down that i need to do that on my own and when they get frustrated at me for bugging them about the same things i get mad at them and snap i feel like ive been snapping more and more often as of late and now i feel like the worst daughter too i just want to be a good person and i try for others but not enough for myself i cant help feeling that ive wasted my life already i used to feel amazing in middle school i had a hobby swimming and close friends and everything but in high school i started to feel more distant and left out from them my depression and anxiety got worse and now its still there though not as bad as it was in high school i always feel like im wasting my time doing things that i dont even know if i truly enjoy and i know i like certain hobbies like swimming and ice skating but for some reason i just stay in the house and dont do much but watch anime play video games watch youtube which i feel has become a bad addition and read i know doing other things is out of my comfort zone but i need to try something i am sorry for the long post but i feel like i need to get my life back on track before it is too late and i have no life left to

festering i live with the mutual friend and i feel even more guilty every time i see him he looked so disappointed when i told him why we broke up he keeps saying that its okay and that i shouldnt feel bad because she forgives me but he wont do what i asked to help me feel better ive seen my ex a few times since then as well only with other people there and just cant enjoy myself because i cant think about anything other than seeing her cry when she confronted me about it i want to go back to feeling okay even if okay is just numb and the way i think i can do that is so messed up and i know that which just makes me feel worse i know its messed up to ask my friend do that as people on another sub have said but i just want to feel better any advice

150,depression,2020-01-15,i guess i just need to let some stuff out sorry if this kind of goes all over the place or is confusing i guess ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for the better part of or so years most of it i think ends up revolving around school ive never been diagnosed or anything and i always felt it got better eventually so i never really reached out to a therapist or doctor or anything i m just entered my last semester of college i was ecstatic i graduated high school in and have been struggling to finish balancing working full time and school every semester around the beginning mostly but several times throughout i start to get a lot of anxiety and i get really sad about everything the work seems overwhelming and i cant help but think of all the time i have to dedicate to do well and how i wont have time for myself really i end up working all day doing homework when i get home walk my dog and play with him a little because i feel bad neglecting him but he is my best friend and then usually watch some tv before bed my off days from work are filled with school and classes so it feels like i never get a break this time when i started the semester on monday i was welcomed with a ton of work for the semester and a ton of work for the first assignment i would say maybe weeks of work and research due in week not to mention i still have other classes that start on thursday i was really really hoping for an easy last semester with maybe one class that requires a lot of work but now it seems like this semester will be the hardest yet i should mention i go to school for digital media lots of design work and branding and marketing especially marketing and branding ourselves lots of projects and research i know its not the end of the world lots of people have a ton of work for college there are harder degrees out there but for some reason this really really affected me i had a panic attack after class and sobbed in my car for some reason not sure if this has anything to do with anything but i also slammed my finger in my car door last thursday and its been healing slowly doctors basically just tell me that you just have to let it heal on its own but its been giving me a lot of anxiety anyways after monday i just felt worse than i ever have before ive been so depressed its been hard to do anything at work im quiet and keep to myself once i get home im tired and just wanna lay down and nap yesterday instead of working on homework when i got home i just felt so exhausted i fell asleep on the couch i had to force myself up to walk and feed my dog i havent had any appetite and have been forcing myself to eat because i know i need to eat something ive hardly been eating anything though parts of sandwiches some fries maybe and then i feel full or nauseous and cant finish it this is worse than ive ever felt and i cant seem to shake it i just want to feel normal again and i dont want to be sad and tired all the time my fiancee f has been very supportive but we are in a long distance relationship until this summer shes been away for over a year now and i proposed back in october she tries to talk to me as much as she can but throughout the day she is at work and of course gets busy i totally understand that but i really look forward to getting her messages because it makes me feel just a little better im really hoping that after this week or so things start going back to normal i keep telling myself its only more months and ill be done and all my hard work will have paid off but i just cant seem to feel better i cry in the morning on my lunch break on my way home from work and once i get home i just wish there was a way to make this just go away again sorry if this was all over the place or hard to understand i just felt like i needed to get it off my chest as i dont really have many people to express these feelings to and i dont want to overwhelm my fiancee because she isnt a therapist she

stroke i was diagnosed with severe depression when i was and before that i was diagnosed with nld and adhd and mild autism and people havent really treated me well if you dont count in my parents i never had any issues at home or anything like that but outside my home i never really fit in a any mold or form of society i was bullied a lot at school and outside of home mostly because of how i looked i was pretty chubby during the ages of  and how i behaved since i didnt have any sort of filter for things that i said or my behaviour in general and i really have to salute my parents for tolerating my shithead behaviour during those ages when i was i started to date this girl with a lot of mental problems and she meant the world to me i got really attached to her i did a lot for her and i was there for her when no one else was and i was the one who helped her get better since the life in her household was pretty terrible her mom left her when she was a kid and her dad was a drug alcohol abuser we dated around years and in those years i did everything to help her overcome her social anxiety and cope with depression we never had any major problems and she became like a part of our family my mom would even treat her like her own daughter but people with mental problems really shouldnt date anyway she ended up cheating on me with times st time i forgave her since she convinced me that she was drunk and didnt think clearly and was just horny and because i loved her so much and didnt wanna leave her which was dumb after that she did it again and i was so heartbroken and i didnt really handle it well so she ended leaving me pretty scarred and damaged its been years since that happend but i still often find myself thinking about her and if she is happy or enjoying the life she has it was really hard for me to move on and actually try to meet new people and even try to find a new girlfriend which i eventually did find but we didnt last very long weeks i guess im

and ive had a really bad outlook on death mortality my entire life when i was about seven i used to be unable to sleep because i would contemplate the shortness of my life against the infinity of time at the time the only way i could reasonably reconcile my limited time on this earth was placing immense pressure on myself to be successful so i would have a long lasting legacy when i inevitably passed and i just developed a really toxic perfectionist attitude and a lot of general anxiety when i got older this fear really started fucking with my mental health i dont know exactly when it started but i started imagining vivid ways to kill myself whenever i felt anxious or like a failure and it really messed me up because my coping mechanism was basically a fantasy of the thing i feared the most in high school i began developing more so recognized my internal philosophy that we are all not unique in ways that are significant which basically ruined the remaining shreds of my self confidence and will to live now i feel like ive reached a certain point of apathy where im just in a state of being casually passively suicidal i cant bring myself to commit suicide because i would feel so guilty doing so but i really just want to go to sleep one night and never wake up i guess i still have some hope for success since i am young but every minor setback just seems so amplified in my mind and causes me to go down a slippery slope and i end up just wanting to die anyways the shittiest thing is theres literally no reason for me to feel this way i cant pinpoint any traumatic

negatives are that my dad was always pretty volatile and constantly criticizing me and my mom would just avoid me when i used to have breakdowns and cry not in a neglectful way though it was just her way of de escalating the situation but i do resent her a little for it i just really dont know what to do anymore i dont want to live because everything seems daunting and requires too much effort but

really dont know what to do anymore i dont want to live because everything seems daunting and requires too much effort but i really cant bring myself to kill myself either and theres this added element of fearing death and feeling guilty about not really having a reason for wanting to die in the first place i dunno i guess im just confused tldr confused teen who used to fear death and is now passively suicidal and just generally unable to cope with life ,fear,anticipation,trust,"[0.9187588691711426, 0.04722824692726135, 0.014027277007699013]"

was ever employed or working im pretty sure my brothers also have depression seeing their behaviour so i cant really depend on them but i dont want this to continue i planned to get my mental health checked this month but my sadness pushes me to buy cigarettes instead though thats not the only problem im too scared that once i do go my father will questions me and will talk me back on not going to the therapist like back in december and im just simply not ready to share my thoughts because were not that close maybe he thought im just lacking discipline and simply lazy i dont think thats the case i have done some research i think i might have the inattentive type of adhd and it has been the massive hinder in my life that always makes me fail im interested in so many things but i feel like i dont know how to start finding out or working on them i used to think i liked to read but i have pile of books i bought that i never read since years ago but when im doing something even studying ill forget to eat and study for hours but it only happens once or twice a month all the small responsibilities that seems easy always overwhelms me im not sure anymore just how much wrong is happen in my life and how much it drives me to insanity because no normal person would fail for years at the simplest things like sleeping or waking up early or even doing small things theyre supposed to do like making their bed after waking up its so damn hard to just wake myself up but i dont want to give up i really want to go to the clinic even if i have to walk even trying to motivate myself to live

words out my girlfriend of three years broke up with me a few days ago she said its best if we go our separate ways i met her on one of these social media apps and someway somehow we started communicating a lot normal conversation start became late night texts and you know how the story goes honestly when i realized i was having feelings for i tried to get away and this is due to my pessimistic perspective way of seeing life i lost my mum when i was very young and my dad just a few years after i dont have to dictate what happened afterwards conventionally life becomes shztty i had a rough childhood physical and mental abuse was constant through it i still carry scars on my body i attempted suicide when i was someway somehow i survived the accident and afterwards i figured there are a lot of lives that ive touched at such a young age the only thing that makes me happy is helping others helping orphans get clothes with the little money i worked for or helping patients in need of financial help ill never attain happiness not in this life people like me arent meant to be happy but im at peace knowing others might yet find happiness through me i told myself this till my mind soul and body accepted it a reason to live shes this lively person and to put her personality in words ill say electrifying she isnt a calm before the storm shes the calm in the midst of the storm when i figured i was starting to have feelings for her i planned my death to just disappear before anyone gets hurt i made a promise to myself to never let my heart get attached to someone lost my mum and my dad was the only hope i had left then he got sick too and i lost him my sister was there for me to make sure i dont see myself as an orphan she tried her best from clothing to education when i felt a little bit of hope life took her from me my very first girlfriend cheated on me with someone from her school perhaps this might give you an idea of how shredded my emotions are someway somehow my ex and i started a relationship it was good she was so kind and full of life we had a lot of dreams if only life is fair huh as time passed i became dependent on her i gave her way too much part of me that im starting to believe there could be a chance to be happy in this life that shes the one for me and honestly thats bad because i dont think i can afford the heartbreak its pessimistic i know i had some girls have dirty conversations with me on my socials and i gave her my details so she can see it and say i wasnt faithful at least thatll make her break up with me i didnt want to be dependent on her i prefer the cold side of life its all i know i didnt want to take any chances it happened and she was rightly mad just as planned i waited for the break up but it never came she wanted us to work it out i just came out clean to her that i just wanted to break up but she asked me to stay and i just let my feelings think for me we were very much in love weeks after she told me about this incident of a guy kissing her during the whole time i was trying to break up with her it hurt and it was like the pessimistic future was certain i thought of it for a while and i told her its fine we can work through it the few months were thee best ive come close ever since my parents its like a new hope for life even though she doesnt think i trust her enough and i wasnt open to her as she was to me little arguments here and there but we worked through them one of the stand out problems from my side is i dont call often and that is due to the fact that i honestly do not like phone calls because of a phone call i couldnt make last time i spoke with my sister we had a verbal fight that i hate myself for till this minute she wanted me to be patient with life and stop hanging out with some people because i was hacking peoples account especially married men having affairs i threatened to expose them to their family and i get paid in mobile credit to keep shut she got sick few weeks later the hospital was far and i didnt have the means to make a single phone call to speak with her the next news of her that came to me was her death it shattered me i couldnt tell her she was right and i love her and shes everything to me i hated phone calls afterwards i know i kept switching between my past and my relationship but i think my past has almost everything to do with my present our relationship was good she celebrated her birthday few weeks ago heres an excerpt from what i sent her the world is too noisy life lost purpose and every picture is just blurry and when i try hard to see it from a different perspective it just is bleak when my ship wrecked in the middle of an ocean and the only thing in sight was the storm about to mix with the huge tidal waves thatll have me drowned you came on youre the hope that redefined life for me cos even amidst that storm you showed me the ocean can yet to sailed it was a rocky relationship we have our moments but it

come back obviously idk what her love life will be like amp i know i sound like a controlling amp paranoid bf but im wondering if i should move on to another girl amp hope we can be back together once i return months is so fucking long i dont want to lose what i have because my happiness has never been this high before i dont want to live in the past thats why i moved far away to college being with a girl who will wake up early in the morning to drive through a blizzard just to buy you cough medicine is something i truly cherish because ive never met one whod do that i asked her why she did it she says i care about you more than you care about your health was i in a dream theres actually someone who loves me like this this is so rare that i dont want to leave her once i broke the news to her she starting bawling her eyes like a faucet telling me that she wont ever find a guy like me again and ill never find a girl as good as her i dont know it now but my depression is going to hit me like a bus within a week i feel like my identity amp life have truly been revoked to be honest ive never felt such a genuine connection with any girl in my life last night i was with her and we partied our asses off we got hammered and it was just her and i on the dance floor the whole bar of people were watching us dance like aarp members she looked me in the eyes and drunkly said any girl would be lucky to have you babe dont fucking forget me okay i dont want you to leave because i still really love you then she started crying again i cant believe i have to leave the very people who care for me the most lifes too good for this to change i can really be myself for once finally i had just gotten to know her other nepali friends wed go partying and cook dinner together they enjoy my company amp treat me like family being around people who actually give a shit about you is something that i hardly experienced in the past i always had to act a certain way to make friends but these people make me feel human for once i make them laugh amp they pull a few pranks on me too for once in my life i have finally reached a state of happiness that has been gone for so unbelievably long seeing her smile when i wake up in the morning gives me reason to enjoy life again i dont want to drive away from my new life i love my school campus pride and friends i dont want to be a forgotten memory to them being with her and spending time with her friends makes me feel alive now i have to leave it all behind without getting to truly bond and make more memories with them in h s i was

you care about your health was i in a dream theres actually someone who loves me like this this is so rare that i dont want to leave her once i broke the news to her she starting bawling her eyes like a faucet telling me that she wont ever find a guy like me again and ill never find a girl as good as her i dont know it now but my depression is going to hit me like a bus within a week i feel like my identity amp life have truly been revoked to be honest ive never felt such a genuine connection with any girl in my life last night i was with her and we partied our asses off we got hammered and it was just her and i on the dance floor the whole bar of people were watching us dance like aarp members she looked me in the eyes and drunkly said any girl would be lucky to have you babe dont fucking forget me okay i dont want you to leave because i still really love you then she started crying again i cant believe i have to leave the very people who care for me the most lifes too good for this to change i can really be myself for once finally i had just gotten to know her other nepali friends wed go partying and cook dinner together they enjoy my company amp treat me like family being around people who actually give a shit about you is something that i hardly experienced in the past i always had to act a certain way to make friends but these people make me feel human for once i make them laugh amp they pull a few pranks on me too for once in my life i have finally reached a state of happiness that has been gone for so unbelievably long seeing her smile when i wake up in the morning gives me reason to enjoy life again i dont want to drive away from my new life i love my school campus pride and friends i dont want to be a forgotten memory to them being with her and spending time with her friends makes me feel alive now i have to leave it all behind without getting to truly bond and make more memories with them in h s i was basically alone now my faith in god is fucking gone i

many questions about who is going and what not she didnt think i trusted her i dont think that is how i felt i think i just love her too much and was scared to lose her i went to therapy and it made me realize why i did all those things and that it was a deep issue that came from my childhood she still loves me she keeps telling me that and she said she is open to getting back together in the future although she also says she wants to fully let me go to work on her self because she has a lot of stressful things going on in her life she has problems with her health mental and physical and she is seeking help for these things and i feel so bad that i wasnt there for her the way i feel i could have been she had anger problems that would start petty arguments a lot and was probably

question tl dr for people that have seriously attempted suicide before can you be totally sure you wont go to that place again and if not how can you fully commit to relationships particularly of the romantic kind ,post,female,suicidal thoughts and relationships around years or so ago i m at the time entered into a pretty serious period of depression physical health related mostly roughly three years after that i attempted suicide multiple times im talking serious planned and thoroughly researched methods i was with a long term partner for most of that time f although the attempts themselves only came after wed split it it wasnt the breakup that tipped me over the edge rather the breakup was the opportunity id been waiting for taking my own life while in a relationship seems to me to be a cruel thing to do as it turned out i can now see that the relationship dysfunctional depression aside and i cant believe it took us years to work that out but the whole experience has totally changed me im far from that mindset now yet im very rarely grateful to be still alive i can think of no particularly good reason to go on living as i find much of life a chore this is despite the fact that objectively all is good and well i eat well have plenty of friends and hobbies live communally with wonderful people and have a relatively comfortable academic research job in well being and sustainability ironically im currently on holiday for weeks running up mountains ffs so here is my dilemma having been so close to taking my own life and knowing that im still quite indifferent about my future i think theres a significant chance that i will end up seriously trying to end my life again in the future and so ive pretty much closed myself off to romance and am perhaps a little guarded more broadly despite craving intimacy deeply because it seems unfair to bring anyone else into that situation and that sucks for me too honestly i dont know how this will change how could i ever be sure that i wont end up that seriously suicidal again and if thats true how can i ever commit to someone as fully as they would like yet closing myself off this way means im missing out on some of

until now one of my parents passed away around that time and it left a void ever since which is probably the route cause of how i feel deep down i have a shitty relationship with most of my immediate family including my remaining parent because they are emotionally and have been physically abusive i have literally friends and a long term partner of years my friends are amazing but they have their own problems so instead of overloading them i prefer to absorb their stresses me and my bf have had ups and downs although i love him dearly i dont feel comfortable sharing my feelings of sadness with him i finished studying for my degree and am currently looking for a job but im struggling to do so because i feel like living is pointless and i have no energy to exist anymore i would say that i have high functioning depression because no one except reddit now knows what ive been doing ive been on and off different types of anti depressants for about years i just started taking sertraline a month ago after a break of year ive tried therapy during this time too but it hasnt helped me when i was a teen i used to self harm by cutting and picking my skin i have always had body issues and for the past months ive been binging purging and using laxatives daily in an effort to lose weight a few months ago i was feeling particularly low and more aggressively suicidal i left home late at night to go to the train station i had been crying and it was winter but i had no jacket phone etc and stood at the platform trying to sike myself up to jump in front of the next train i was hesitant because i dont want to leave my youngest sibling behind it feels like they need me but i literally cant escape the voices in my head that tell me im fucking worthless and disgusting so i wanted so badly to end it someone intervened and warned the station staff so i was dragged into their offices crying which was ultimately very embarrassing lately i look at suicide methods online all the time i dont have a particular time or date for ending things but i still know that i want this to be over i should also note that i hate reaching out to suicide hotlines samaritans as i dont feel like they helped in previous experiences i had a few years ago i am too ashamed to admit myself anywhere because i hate the thought of my family and partner beginning to question everything they think they know about me i have seen so many success stories online about people managing and overcoming their mental illnesses but i dont make any progress it feels like im slipping deeper into a void where i feel nothing but numbness and self loathing im actually jealous of the fact that one of my parents are dead and im still here i just want to know what im doing wrong in instances where other people seem to

him i finished studying for my degree and am currently looking for a job but im struggling to do so because i feel like living is pointless and i have no energy to exist anymore i would say that i have high functioning depression because no one except reddit now knows what ive been doing ive been on and off different types of anti depressants for about years i just started taking sertraline a month ago after a break of year ive tried therapy during this time too but it hasnt helped me when i was a teen i used to self harm by cutting and picking my skin i have always had body issues and for the past months ive been binging purging and using laxatives daily in an effort to lose weight a few months ago i was feeling particularly low and more aggressively suicidal i left home late at night to go to the train station i had been crying and it was winter but i had no jacket phone etc and stood at the platform trying to sike myself up to jump in front of the next train i was hesitant because i dont want to leave my youngest sibling behind it feels like they need me but i literally cant escape the voices in my head that tell me im fucking worthless and disgusting so i wanted so badly to end it someone intervened and warned the station staff so i was dragged into their offices crying which was ultimately very embarrassing lately i look at suicide methods online all the time i dont have a particular time or date for ending things but i still know that i want this to be over i should also note that i hate reaching out to suicide hotlines samaritans as i dont feel like they helped in previous experiences i had a few years ago i am too ashamed to admit myself anywhere because i hate the thought of my family and partner beginning to question everything they think they know about me i have seen so many success stories online about people managing and overcoming their mental illnesses but i dont make any progress it feels like im slipping deeper into a void where i feel nothing but numbness and self loathing im actually jealous of the fact that one of my parents are dead and im still here i just want to know what im doing wrong in instances where other people seem to go right ,fear,anticipation,anger,"[0.45691463351249695, 0.2310960292816162, 0.1573450267314911]"

several hours every day and it is very hard to calm myself down i have a boyfriend since years but he has been away for nearly months now he decided to take time off between jobs and went back to stay with his family in europe i think him going away was a major trigger as i am alone in the house and just doing work home i was alone on xmas new years valentines and it was well depressing i love him very much but his going for so long without me indicated to me that he is much less attached and our relationship is not reciprocal also i work as a postdoctoral scientist in academia and my funding is ending soon but i have been unable to find a job despite doing fairly well scientifically what a waste of time facing real possibility of unemployment finally i have a high chance of infertility due to not only my age but also underlying health issues so i am in this dark cloud of despair the only person who knows about my mental health issues is my partner but he somehow does not take it seriously he thinks it is just my way to get attention so i thought i need professional help but i contacted my insurance u s and their first available appointment is in may months from now i cannot go on like this for months i need some medicines to keep me calm i think i eat healthy i exercise days a week but doesnt seem to help i am not just sad all the time but get hysterical with these crying spells and then i am too exhausted to fall asleep somehow and it is a spiral down i average hours of sleep according to my fitbit and then i usually have very unpleasant dreams i think they dont consider me as an emergency because i told that i am not suicidal which i indeed am not of course it crosses my mind and it is an obvious solution for my personal suffering but i wouldnt ever

not be too much longer if i cant get some emotional support in november my long term relationship ended and i had to move out of our shared home leaving our dog and his daughter that ive grown to love im f and this relationship was on off for years i do truly love him and cant seem to get past the life we were building together i feel so unbelievably lonely ive tried dating new people and keeping myself distracted but it all just reminds me how empty i feel around that same time my parents sold our family home and moved away from my hometown which has been a great source of loss for me because its the only place ive ever felt like i belonged i live several hours away and now have no reason to ever go home again its an unsettling feeling in december my grandmother that raised me for the first years of my life entered hospice and passed away in january she was one of the closest people in my life a week later someone i cared about threatened attempted suicide and i had to talk them off the ledge it was an unhealthy and manipulative friendship that i have since had to cut off for my own sanity less than a week later i had to put my cat to sleep id had him years he had been with me through dozens of moves one halfway across the country and back and probably just as many relationships i always joked that he was the only man that ever stuck with me this is the first time in my entire years that ive ever lived in a house without another heartbeat in it its lonely but no more pets for me last week i just found out that the owners of my company are restructuring and bringing in new management in weeks and our office staff may not get to keep our jobs i have savings to tide me over for a couple of months if i do end up unemployed but its hard to find a job doing what i do

playing a sick joke on me how much more can i lose who have i pissed off up there i know i need to see a counselor but given that i may be unemployed soon i cant commit to making that weekly payment im sure there may be low cost options out there somewhere but i imagine the waiting list for those is ten miles long and i dont want to take away spots that should be used by people with worse more acute issues than i do so counseling will have to wait until i know that i have a job i have very few friends to lean on and no one really knows what to say to me other than it just takes time things will get better you have to experience the grief as it comes and time will heal you yeah i know that logically but it doesnt help me right now doesnt keep me from being overly touchy or irritable or

i didnt enjoy school due to lack of understanding particular subjects and feeling i was more behind than my peers the only subjects i excelled in was art amp design and english but despite even that i was so unmotivated to do it and i couldve really hit the high grades if i had tried harder and studied before exams something i didnt do from a young age i took to a passion for aviation i remember flying for the first time and being absolutely drawn in to the industry i remember my flight being delayed for hours and the entire time i had my little face pressed up against the glass over looking the airside area fixed to the activity going on below and taking it all in my ambition was to be a flight attendant after finishing school at i got a place in my dream college a college specific for aviation it was a long way from home but i managed to make it work im still attending now this is my second year and this second year is what i would like to address in this passage the issue is that i am behind in my work extremely behind i have no other excuse than myself for this im going to try and explain this the best way i can in the hopes some of you guys may have been through similar if not the same thing i absolutely love the subject i am studying and im very blessed to be attending and have a seat in the class i still very much wish to be a flight attendant so its not a case of not having a passion for learning i want to learn i havent lacked motivation in that area but where my work is concerned i just cannot do it its not a case of not understanding because when i do eventually get around to my work i believe i can do it well i just cannot bring myself to be organised motivated and work before the deadline even after my work is late i simply cannot force myself to address it its like a weight that holds me down in my bed and convinces me the work can be left i dont know how to describe it i cant be organised and do my work in regular intervals to ensure my work meets the deadline its like a constant fight between my heart and my head i hate disappointing my tutors which have been so lovely to me however i have not spoken to them about how i feel i feel

love them too they are everything i wanted in my family as a kid i regularly see a therapist and a psychologist and am on medication two things have triggered my downward spiral the loss of a written prescription of my antidepressants which has caused me to be off them for about a month but i have since found and been back on them but only for about days and this is also my fault and im kicking myself for this and the severing of my relationship with my mother she had me young and we have had a super insane relationship with no boundaries at all whatsoever she is my absolute best friend in the whole world but also the cause of my depression and anxiety regularly verbally and emotionally manipulating and abusing me since i hit puberty because of all of this i am incredibly depressed and

unknowingly following my parents example none of them would ever admit this though theyre all proud of me for being the first and only to graduate college despite not actually caring to know who i am as a person i developed self esteem issues at a really young age because of this still ive spent the past decade trying to build myself up and hanging on to hope things will get better mentally i was actually ok up until last summer ended i got the opportunity to start working as a teacher something ive always wanted to do i loved my job i loved the kids and it turns out i also love math the problem was that i was new didnt study education had no experience or training and was then basically pushed in the deep end teaching math to every student in the school the workload was massive and i was crumbling i held on as long as i could not only because i didnt want to accept failure but for the reasons mentioned above i loved my job but it was breaking me i had no time to myself and barely enough time to sleep it put strain on my relationship because i was too stressed and anxious to just be myself even on the weekends cause i had to spend that free time preparing for the week ahead and grasping old work i was dissociating a lot i remember one time i saw myself in the mirror and was surprised because i literally forgot who i was nobody called me by my first name anymore i barely had time to shower every day or make myself pretty in fact i had to actively try to make myself less attractive because my students were too horny i started using blow because it made me feel like i could do the things and i could finally without feeling like an empty husk but after a couple months i felt that it was inevitably going to get out of hand so i had to stop and that made doing the things even harder and then the workload increased yet again the day i quit i couldnt even get out of bed how anxious and just weak i felt i still feel like a failure for not making it to june and probably will for the rest of my life my best friend years hasnt spoken to me since i quit she also hadnt really spoken to me much before then either she would say shed be there for me but wouldnt return my

anxious about my job i was doing well there in my career made good money was headed on vacation to the beach in a couple of weeks and started hanging out with someone who i thought liked me fast forward to now i was fired from that job then i got another job which i was laid off from in december because they got rid of my whole department still looking for work still have never had a serious relationship or someone that just wanted to be with me and wasnt shy about it and had no ulterior motives and i am beyond sad and cry every day im crying writing this i want to feel better to stop comparing my life to others and not constantly hate myself and feel so fucking lonely that i go on apps to talk to people just to make the day go by but i cant it frustrates me and i feel so dumb dating it has been so awful for me i know that having a partner wont bring me the happiness i need on my own i need to focus on myself my time will come but i hate hate hate hearing that shit i have been focusing on myself for the last  years and i think there is nothing wrong with wanting to date and have a partner to share my life with and i also hate when someone says but youre so pretty smart and kind and alluring youll find someone you dont know that  i have been noticeably different towards my friends i decided to open up to one of them and now that i have i really wish i had just gone with the im fine response she is trying to help and i know that i am difficult to even have a conversation with right now she said if i needed distance then she would give it but it feels selfish to do that so i continue to say its fine to continue talking but it hurts to hear about hers or the other people in my life increase in pay at her job her new guy she is seeing how her life is going so well when mine is utter and complete shit and all i can do is compare and it leads to more crying she says she wants to help me get out of the funk im in and that i have every right to feel how i feel but i need to be more positive i love her and thank her for want to help but i hate hearing that which then leads me back to thinking maybe i should just distance myself weve argued a bit lately and i know its because of me ive become too attached we talk throughout the day every day amp i get more anxious when i dont hear from her i tried being vulnerable this afternoon and i still havent heard from her but i am resisting sending another text i absolutely hate how much things like this i s affect my happiness i wish i wasnt such a shit person and friend people always suggest gym and eating better as ways to cope well the thing is is that i already go to the gym times a week sometimes daily there around min to hours during that time is the only time i am confident happy and determined in myself i feel strong capable and on top of the world but as soon as i leave its back to shit but if i did not have the gym i do not know how even darker and more depressed i would feel also i live at home with my parents and sister right now i havent eaten more than one small meal a day really in the past days ive been able to hide it from them not that i am trying to starve myself but when i get really sad nowadays it i think i disappoint my friend or my family i dont eat due to not working and not really having money i dont go anywhere which leads to minimal social interaction i did not realize that it would affect me so much but it really has on the off chance i talk to someone at the gym that makes my week because that is usually the only interaction i get i go to my favorite local bar every so often and it helps just to be somewhere different but i feel guilty spending a little money on two drinks and to socialize i do the the things that they say most people who are depressed usually dont do i clean make meals for myself shower daily go to the gym so then i think to myself maybe im not depressed maybe im making this up and it isnt legitimate and job ive applied but honestly i have been hesitant to apply to a lot of jobs because i just dont feel smart enough or capable enough at all i have colleagues in my field who say i am young smart and capable but it doesnt feel that way given my recent job history how are you my honest answer for the last  months i am tired i am lonely and im stupid and i hate myself ,post,female,i f am a crying babbling mess life does not seem to be getting any better this time last year my f life was so different although i was lbs heavier than i am now amp really anxious about my job i was doing well there in my career made good money was headed on vacation to the beach in a couple of weeks and started hanging out with someone who i thought liked me fast forward to now i was fired from that job then i got another job which i was laid off from in december because they got rid of my whole department still looking for work still have never had a serious relationship or someone that just wanted to be with me and wasnt shy about it and had no ulterior motives and i am beyond sad and cry every day im crying writing this i want to feel better to stop comparing my life to others and not constantly hate myself and feel so fucking lonely that i go on apps to talk to people just to make the day go by but i cant it frustrates me and i feel so dumb dating it has been so awful for me i know that having a partner wont bring me the happiness i need on my own i need to focus on myself my time will come but i hate hate hate hearing that shit i have been focusing on myself for the last  years and i think there is nothing wrong with wanting to date and have a partner to share my life with and i also hate when someone says but youre so pretty smart and kind and alluring youll find someone you dont know that  i have been noticeably different towards my friends i decided to open up to one of them and now that i have i really wish i had just gone with the im fine response she is trying to help and i know that i am difficult to even have a conversation with right now she said if i needed distance then she would give it but it feels selfish to do that so i continue to say its fine to continue talking but it hurts to hear about hers or the other people in my life increase in pay at her job her new guy she is seeing how her life is going so well when mine is utter and complete shit and all i can do is compare and it leads to more crying she says she wants to help me get out of the funk im in and that i have every right to feel how i feel but i need to be more positive i love her and thank her for want to help but i hate hearing that which then leads me back to thinking maybe i should just distance myself weve argued a bit lately and i know its because of me ive become too attached we talk throughout

353,depression,2020-04-01,i feel like im falling apart again this time last year i had a full blown mental breakdown my ex ghosted me and i had a falling out with my best friend i wanted to drop out of school and quit my job i was having immense social issues at work and i was having suicidal thoughts again i f decided to start therapy in february of last year i started seeing a counselor and psychiatrist at my university and i tried to be more active during my classes it was the first time in many many years that i had sought professional help or tried to connect with my peers more recently i moved out of the shitty apartment that my ex and i shared and i finally left the retail job that made me super unhappy i felt great i was making monumental changes i was prepared to finish out the semester and walk during my graduation next month in a matter of weeks i have lost my new job my school has converted all on campus classes to canvas and ive been confined to my apartment  i cannot see my peers i no longer have co workers to speak to and i cant attend counseling or utilize any other service that ive been using to better myself this morning i checked my e mail and found that i am no longer under consideration for the customer service job i applied to since being laid off i wasnt looking forward to the job but emotionally it was a monumental letdown most people in my life that i would hesitate to call my friends told me that this particular job at this particular company is unpleasant but they all emphasized that it is easy to get they made me feel like any simpleton could get a job at this company and now i feel like even more of a failure im incredibly overwhelmed i have also learned recently that my commencement for graduation might be canceled at the moment they have postponed it until august the only people trying to keep in contact with me during the pandemic are my mom and my ndad im trying to file for unemployment and it is honestly one of the most emotionally draining and arduous things ive ever had to do at the beginning of this year i felt like i had come so far like i had completely turned my life around not i back to square one and im having suicidal thoughts again i dont know what to do and i have no motivation anymore i feel like i cant have anything good i can try but everything will fall apart again ive been through awful things in my life particularly my childhood and i really felt like things would be different this year ,post,female,i feel like im falling apart again this time last year i had a full blown mental breakdown my ex ghosted me and i had a falling out with my best friend i wanted to drop out of school and quit my job i was having immense social issues at work and i was having suicidal thoughts again i f decided to start therapy in february of last year i started seeing a counselor and psychiatrist at my university and i tried to be more active during my classes it was the first time in many many years that i had sought professional help or tried to connect with my peers more recently i moved out of the shitty apartment that my ex and i shared and i finally left the retail job that made me super unhappy i felt great i was making monumental changes i was prepared to finish out the semester and walk during my graduation next month in a matter of weeks i have lost my new job my school has converted all on campus classes to canvas and ive been confined to my apartment  i cannot see my peers i no longer have co workers to speak to and i cant attend counseling or utilize any other service that ive been using to better myself this morning i checked my e mail and found that i am no longer under consideration for the customer service job i applied to since being laid off i wasnt looking forward to the job but emotionally it was a monumental letdown most people in my life that i would hesitate to call my friends told me that this particular job at this particular company is unpleasant but they all emphasized that it is easy to get they made me feel like any simpleton could get a job at this company and now i feel like even more of a failure im incredibly overwhelmed i have also learned recently that my commencement for graduation might be canceled at the moment they have postponed it until august the only people trying to keep in contact with me during the pandemic are my mom and my ndad im trying to file for unemployment and it is honestly one of the most emotionally draining and arduous things ive ever had to do at the beginning of this year i felt like i had

354,depression,2020-04-01,im emotionally scarred from a past friendship crush how do i get over this f so back when i was years old i had a crush on one of my counselors lets call him dan i admired him a lot he played the same video games as me and he grew up in the same area as me when i turned i became a junior counselor along with him the junior counselors were no different than the senior counselors i still had a bit of a crush on him but i focused on being friends with him along with the other counselors we were pretty good friends for a few years i went on a trip to wisconsin with him to meet another one of our counselor friends he came over to my house for a weekend and we toured the city and went to a parade i made him gifts that i thought were friendly but it might have been my subconscious secretly wanting him to like me back so it comes around that i need to pick somewhere to go to college he suggested that i apply to his alma mater i dismissed him at first and told him it was too close to home he kept telling me to check it out i eventually listened to him and i actually liked that school more than the others i visited it turns out i was accepted and ended up enrolling i was excited but he kept getting more and more distant i would text him and wouldnt hear back from him for days i asked him about his friends on campus and if i could meet up with them i ended up becoming friends with one of them but not the others i invited him to a lot of campus parties and events no reply i finally asked him why he stopped replying he said he didnt want to be friends with me anymore he went on a tirade saying i was a bad counselor and he didnt like how i became friends with his friends from college he didnt like how i went to the same college as him this came out of nowhere it hit me really hard i didnt know what to do our say i felt like the past year of our friendship was a lie and im still not over it i felt like i constantly annoy people and im incapable of having lasting friendships because they are eventually going to think im a horrible person and theyre going to leave me i fear that its happening again im friends with this guy who i am developing a crush on and i feel like hes going to resent me for being nice to him and hes going to end our friendship because im being clingy i really want to keep his friendship i like him a lot and my stupid romantic feelings are getting in the way i want to tell him i have a crush on him and if he doesnt like me back i just have to deal and if hes okay just being friends how do i get over this trauma i experienced its crippling and it gives me anxiety every time i start a new friendship or relationship tl dr i have trauma from a previous crush who turned into a friend he rejected me and said horrible things how do i get over the trauma of him doing this to me while making new friends having new relationships ,post,female,im emotionally scarred from a past friendship crush how do i

355,depression,2020-04-02,i f need advice on how to help my boyfriend m get through his depression i myself am a sufferer of mental health issues though i feel as though i cope as best i can i remind myself of how lucky i am whilst also not dismissing how i feel i take necessary days off to in the long term aid my mental health i have routines and resources to look forward to i also have outlets to vent to in times of despair ive dealt with depression long enough to over come it for the most part whilst still suffering my brother attempted suicide when i was and from that point onwards it was the beginning of my mental health issues though going through that i know suicide is an option i will never consider whilst even feeling suicidal the lasting damage is too painful on those you love and ive learned how precious life is through this in conclusion ive come to terms with my depression being apart of me and ive tried my best to adapt im glad im growing up in a period of time where mental health for the most part is normalised if not i dont think i would cope as well as i do though my boyfriend on the other hand struggles to see the light and struggles to get through the day with his underlying depressive thoughts these depressive thoughts have become darker he doesnt put the pressure of suicide on our relationship though he has made it clear he has suicidal thoughts and finds it hard to see past these thoughts with everything going on right now and for him to not have his usual resources of happiness that help him through the day he is getting worse also me not being there in person to comfort him is hurting him a lot i feel myself getting overwhelmed by everything also but im still coping and believe this is temporary and it will all be okay if i didnt think this way i also would be cracking up alike him but he cant seem to take on this it will be okay mindset which is important right now but it would be ignorant of me to get annoyed that he doesnt think this way because thats an element of depression which he has negative thoughts and feelings of despair i have voiced that i think he needs professional help as have his friends he got the courage to openly discuss his mental health to his friends and have they also in return hes aware it isnt fair to put this stress over us by opening up about how he feels regarding his suicidal thoughts though he cant come to terms with getting to the point of talking to his parents that would be the first step in getting towards professional help i cant help put feel overwhelmed when the topic comes up i dont know how to react im not a professional my advice to him is to realise how he currently feels is only temporary and that i myself go through bouts of depression i get out of them im okay for a while i fall back he has never experienced depression up until years ago i have experienced depression for the past years hence my reasoning for my development of coping mechanisms he cant come to terms with why he isnt like his old self why he isnt happy all the time we all have our breaking point i believe when childhood happiness just fades though he often thinks back to when he didnt feel this way but i dont know how to help that with my experiences and relatability to how he feels in ways still doesnt help i never turn things on myself i simply resonate im aware of how annoying it is when your upset and someone ignorantly makes it about them i give advice as to how i deal how i think he should approach things that will help him but i cant help him i dont know how to help him but all i want to do is to help and be there i believe he is only going to get worse as this goes on and i dont know where else to go for advice i myself will probably only worsen too i feel we all will but how do we keep

her age tend to get ive been in the hospital since march nd with our daughter who turned on the march st everything was going okay so far her dad was coming over every night after work and being all the great things bc otherwise id be pissed at him for not being here for us weve had this fight one too many times but he stepped it up this time i told him i was so happy and proud that we were doing okay and he was here for us but then covid hit us and suddenly shit got really real for us they kicked out my mom one week and limited to visitors to only mom and dad at bedside a week later dad got kicked out now its only me allowed at bedside its been super rough going through all of this alone to say the least then things really started to get emotionally draining for me her dad started being

was curious and wanted to see how shes doing apparently the girl who cheated on him with her best friend i questioned him about the other girl the one that he was liking her post he said he had no idea who she was and it just popped up on his timeline we eventually sort of get over our fighting but i wasnt over it honestly i was just tired of fighting tired of having to dumb things down for him and explain why his behavior is inappropriate and why it was hurtful for him to be a certain ways towards me regardless of how irritated he is things seemed kind of steady and okay hes texting me often calling me once hes out of work bringing me food everyday again all the great things telling me how he cant wait for us to be home so he can hold us and his arms all the great things he shouldve

about knowing her he was planning to meet up with her tomorrow to hang out and smoke after telling him all of this and i knew the truth about it all he admitted it to me finally he didnt really seem apologetic didnt apologize kept saying he doesnt know what to say or how to fix it he also said that hes not displaying any sympathy because hes half awake and super sleepy i feel so shitty ive been crying non stop i wanted to stay with him despite all of this to work this out for the sake of our daughter he says he wants us to be a family and wont talk to her anymore but i dont trust him im

already going crazy thinking about what hes going to do tomorrow and if hes going to lie to me and still hang out with her its already over hopefully well be getting discharged within the next week or so and i have no idea where were going to go i dont want to go home to our apartment thats not a home anymore my daughter is special needs and i havent been able to work after graduating school because she doesnt qualify for nursing something she needs and theres not a daycare available that can watch her my mom is not willing to help out much as far as daycare goes either i dont know what the heck im going to do but i do know that i cant go back to him after this ,post,female,my f bf m of years got caught cheating on me while i am here in the childrens hospital with our yo daughter whos intubated and fighting a viral pneumonia ive been so tired so depressed dealing with different doctors everyday my daughters developmentally delayed with a seizure disorder so it was a little more difficult for her to fight off this common viral pneumonia kids her age tend to get ive been in the hospital since march nd with our daughter who turned on the march st everything was going okay so far her dad was coming over every night after work and being all the great things bc otherwise id be pissed at him for not being here for us weve had this fight one too many times but he stepped it up this time i told him i was so happy and proud that we were doing okay and he was here for us but then covid hit us and suddenly shit got really real for us they kicked out my mom one week and limited to visitors to only mom and dad at bedside a week later dad got kicked out now its only me allowed at bedside its been super rough going through all of this alone to say the least then things really started to get emotionally draining for me her dad started being irresponsible pulling rent money from our savings to buy weed smoking way too much spending long amounts of hours on the game he stopped texting me back i would get upset because i needed him here for me still and wanted to talk to him i dont have anyone to talk to hes supposed to be my person we fought over that for a few days i didnt talk to him for two days his facebook was logged in on his laptop that was left here for me to watch tv on i got curious he was liking this one girls post at in the morning more on that later he also unblocked one of his exes apparently he felt compelled to check up on them and see how theyre doing at am instead of thinking about us and checking to see how were doing over here which really sucked i questioned him i asked him why he unblocked her he just was curious and wanted to see how shes doing apparently the girl who cheated on him with her best friend i questioned him about the other girl the one that he was liking her post he said he had no idea who she was and it just popped up on his timeline we eventually sort of get over our fighting but i wasnt over it honestly i was just tired of fighting tired of having to dumb things down for him and explain why his behavior is inappropriate and why it was hurtful for him to be a certain ways towards me regardless of how irritated he is things seemed kind of steady and okay hes texting me often calling me once hes out of work bringing me food everyday again all the great things telling me how he cant wait for us to be home so he can hold us and his arms all the great things he shouldve been doing all along then i find out that hes been messaging the one girl that he denied knowing through snapchat hes been consistently talking to her he met her through his coworker he lied to me about knowing her he was planning to meet up with her tomorrow to hang out and smoke after telling him all of this and i knew the truth about it all he admitted it to me finally he didnt really seem apologetic didnt apologize kept saying he doesnt know what to say or how to fix it he also said that hes not displaying any sympathy because hes half awake and super sleepy i feel so shitty ive been crying non stop i wanted to stay with him despite all of this to work this out for the sake of our daughter he says he wants

ago he revealed to us at home that he grew up in an abusive home his dad was an alcoholic and physically abusive possibly sexually abusive prior to telling us this he used to idolize his father in an almost obsessive way i am a girl but he named me after his father and gave me a male name as my middle name this childhood abuse makes sense because he has always been emotionally immature and irresponsible i am years old and i have never depended on my dad he is terrible with money and always in between jobs he also worked in many different countries when i was growing up and so we have never had such a close relationship my dad is a very traditional indian hindu he does not believe in going to a doctor for his depression but has attempted suicide multiple times instead he goes to gurus and yogis to help him and has an obsession with yoga i do not believe this helps him because he is still depressed and searching for meaning in life because of this he is obsessed with helping the poor this isnt a bad thing i know but he does it to the extent that he runs us into debt to give to others and steals things from our home to donate to others so he can feel good about himself while putting his own family through duress it has caused a huge rift in our family as my mother is the only person who provides for my siblings and i and he puts a financial strain on our lives with his desperate attempt to find purpose but i feel bad for him because i know he is a very sad person on the inside when my siblings and i started working he started asking us for money all the time so he could donate it or build yoga studios for his gurus i am not trying to offend anyone but i do believe some of these gurus are scam artists and some of these yoga groups are like cults i am not a religious person and i dont think any religion is beyond reproach i think he gets taken advantage of by these gurus who use him for his money his siblings also take advantage of him by constantly asking him for money many people take advantage of him for money and he gives it to them because he needs to feel fulfilled then he comes to us and takes our money because he has none as an aside after high school i was accepted to every college i applied to and one was my dream school to study aerospace engineering i was unable to go because my dad said he had no money a couple years later when one of my cousins wanted to study at her dream school he offered to sell some of his real estate to pay for her education as a donation so he could feel good about himself i have never forgiven him for this he goes out of his way to provide for others and does nothing for my siblings mom and i no one in my family can tell my dad anything about his terrible money habits because he gets depressed and threatens to kill himself so we just have to let him do him for all these years now that covid is happening were supposed to stay in our houses to avoid being sick my dad has recently had a surgery and is diabetic so he is at risk for covid my older sister is a covid doctor on the frontline treating patients and isolated at the hospital she has called and told my dad repeatedly to stay at home because things are bad he refuses to stay at home and goes out everyday to build his yoga studio and make donations he has taken my credit card and spent thousands on this studio and these donations in the past few weeks when i am currently out of a job due to covid and need to save my money as i am migrating to canada to start a new life soon this has been my breaking point so today i finally told him about his spending habits and the fact that none of his children feel like they can rely on him as a parent it was a bad fight and he has not been talking to me since and seems upset now i am worried he might do something to hurt himself or that i may have made him more depressed which wasnt my intention but i just lost it today after years of dealing with his behavior i have also dealt with an cocaine addicted cousin and i still feel like my fathers behavior has been more stressful to deal with i dont know what to do now so maybe someone can help me it is not my

want him to kill himself over things i try to address in his behavior should i just let him do as he pleases and then maybe i can go to therapy to help deal with the stress he causes me rather than

most of my life was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen diagnosed with bpd in my mid s and believe ive got some undiagnosed neurodiversity i grew up in a house were feelings were never talked about sadness was ignored or belittled and ive always felt incredibly lonely over the weekend i accidentally discovered my partner m has a porn addiction weve been together for getting close to a decade now the closest ive ever gotten to finding out he has a pa was around our year anniversary i learnt that he was sexting role playing with someone on instagram to me that was a huge betrayal of trust and we almost broke up he convinced me that he would change we went to couples therapy together and i thought that we had moved past it all anyway it turns out that while he was no longer an active participant in his addiction he has still been on porn sites every single damn day he seems to think that he has never outright lied to me about the porn stuff but we have been dealing with him having erectile dysfunction for a couple of years now and he never once thought to make the connection or talk to me about it and at one point to try and help our sex life i had suggested that he read me something dirty that turns him on as i knew he enjoyed reading porn and he enjoys reading his favourite novels to me but he completely dismissed it and made it seem like he no longer read any porn ive become an absolute wreck i thought i knew everything about him i thought we were close enough that he could of come to me about anything and i wouldve been able to be there for him with very little judgement and im still somewhat understanding im empathetic to what hes probably going through right now after hes been caught out and the breakdown of our relationship but he has hit so many triggering things for me at first it was just the hurt and betrayal of trust and rejection sensitivity feeling like im not enough like im not good enough and thats then triggered a major depressive episode for me ive only been able to sleep once i get so drunk and stoned i can barely function ive self harmed again and hes given me space like ive asked for but in the middle of a depressive episode it has then triggered all my old abandonment issues there was a point were i honestly felt like i was again in the middle of a breakdown and just needing some form of comfort and hearing people in the other room who know how distressed i am and they just ignore it ive completely regressed from all the healthy techniques ive developed over the years and am back to all my shitty ones every time he talks to me its to tell me hes booked a doctors appointment or hes deleted all the browser history or spoken to a friend or found support groups online or unfollowed people on instagram

22,depression,2019-03-19,broke up m with possibly depressed gf for the past year in the city of chicago i was with the best gf i have ever had in my entire life we had so much fun and expressed our feelings multiple times while having only polite arguments about what troubled us regarding our relationship during this time she has told me multiple times that she feels i am the only one who can provide her with the sentiment of safety and calmness but she cannot do that as well while always feeling bad about it as well as herself and worthless regarding how she deals with her life and university studies as a nurse she also drinks a lot and in one or two cases times a week getting almost always drunk while her appetite was extremely low something i always encouraged her to fix as background information she had lost her mother out of nowhere some years ago and i deduced that she started drinking after that when in the past she never did but not like an alcoholic recently i noticed that she was beginning to isolate herself from me out of the blue when i adressed this issue she responded by telling me she is not feeling very well recently not due to something that i did but she is thinking about the problems of her life and that leads her to being isolated from me after not contacting her for about two days she says she wants to meet in order to talk when that happened she told me that she still loves me and doesnt want to be with anyone else right now apart from me but she needs time in order to sort her life out and create priorities telling me she doesnt want to be a burden to me and waste my time with her problems she then started kissing and hugging me and mentioned something about us being together in the future as well as she doesnt want me to see her as a friend also she wants me to contact her whenever i want to without her doing so during this time and i at first rejected this telling her to contact me whenever she felt like it i didnt push her or try to change her mind when she announced her decision and told her that even if i dont like it i respect her decision completely being devastated and heartbroken since i was having the time of my life i really do not know how to approach this problem i genuinely care about her being alright but after reading so much about depression related behaviours i am starting to think she is going through with something like this she has never visited a therapist or at least i dont know about that does she really want me to contact her often did she say she still loves me just for me to not get hurt how can i help her during this time in the hopes of us being together again or at least her getting well she looked very sad and was crying that she had to do this to me and i really want her to get well soon but i cannot stand the thought of the possibility of her telling me she doesnt feel the same for me anymore after a few weeks if anyone has had a same experience please share your

with a lot of stress but things have smoothed out we left a busy suburban area and moved to a rural area with a beautiful view from each window even in my dark times staring out the window seems to help connect me to the life going on around me watching the birds hopping around the yard and the expanse of lush green grass its not much but it calms me it reels me back in i dont know why i recently came home to a large rv recreational vehicle parked at our house it turns out our friends were in a bind and needed somewhere to park it for awhile my husband agreed to let them park it at our house with no real timeline established about when it would be moved i adore our friends and dont have a problem with helping them out except that i was dismayed to find out that the views from the windows inside my house are now obstructed by the rv no more birds to be seen no more butterflies or bees buzzing around the yard no more yard just a big ugly rv its disheartening but temporary i guess i asked my husband if our friends could move the rv to a different spot somewhere in the yard that didnt obstruct the view he thinks im making a big deal about nothing im certainly not trying to make anything a big deal but looking out the window was one of the safe things i could rely on while being inside the house i still yearn to be able to watch nature happening outside while im busy inside with chores instead of being sensitive or understanding my husband accused me of using the rv issue as a reason to be upset as if i want to be upset about something for a guy who has lived with me for almost years i didnt think it was possible to understand me any less i dont even see you looking out any windows ever he said you never look out the windows youre just looking for a reason to be upset so now im upset and feeling worse because of this stupid depression that wont go away i just wanted to watch the birds outside the windows i guess its a big deal to move the rv because there has to be a special truck to move it and who knows what else i dont want to be the asshole to bring it up to my friends to move their rv i will try to hang in there i completely withdrew myself today slammed the baby food down and ran crying to my room why the hell would any depressed person make up an additional reason to be upset arent we already upset about things the obstruction of my view outside the window is a very real thing to me it means a lot to me to be able to see out the window and i guess i am crazy for being upset about it but whats new now im back in a dark place inside myself just wishing i had the strength to pull myself out of this tomorrow ill go outside and be with the birds in person tomorrow ill try harder ,pre,male, youre just looking for a reason to be upset

this whole thing why depression hit me with the start of college and i didnt get diagnosed officially until last october the peak of my issues i was also diagnosed with adhd at the same time which i had suspected for a while been on zoloft and adderall xr since and its definitely helped me out a good deal i felt incredible starting off with adderall productivity increased so much i did pretty well last semester however last few days i just feel like it isnt working like it used to days in a row now ive done nothing all day besides occasional breaks to eat or feel shitty for saying this jerking off days ago i decided to get high all alone but i was actually pretty happy today was gonna be productive id finally start studying for exams it took me until to wake up tho took meds thought id feel better fucking nothing i took an extra one thinking it would help as it did once earlier when i grinded out a project with an all nighter still nothing im kinda just venting and just realized that losing the schedule of classes i had to these study days before the exam made me sorta lose some efficiency but i feel less productive and way more depressed than before am i too dependent on this shit parents were hesitant on getting it for me initially and i days i dont take it im absolutely fucking miserable its fucking am and youre reading my dumbass adhd depression self pity rant thats for that ugh im just so fucking frustrated guys i have people who care about me im a good human being goddamnit why cant i do some basic fucking studying parents worked their asses off to get me here and i cant even get out of bed its just one more week i was doing so good why now ugh i slept during the day and cant now just continuing to fuck myself over also im just constantly thinking about girls now glad the zoloft is fucking over my sex drive but yeah i feel like i think about it too much i feel like i should have gone through this back in high school why now is jerking off like

fashion sense i lost pounds but the weight is slowly coming back now im not ugly or fat  just cant deal with some fucking acne and maybe the fact that im indian like i get it i dont find all girls attractive so they all wont find me attractive either but i guess tinder failures and porn are fucking over my world view im not entitled to anything but damn itd be nice for someone that isnt my mom or family friend say im attractive i think most girls might not find indian guys attractive and fuck it i dont blame them culture always pens us as asexual fucking nerds i dont want to ask for compliments cause i feel like a dick doing that but one of the few friends i have has even said i kinda subconsciously do that by like bringing up shit im proud of like last semester i dropped classes and got a c and a d in the remaining ones but i played a bunch of daily fantasy football and over a few weeks made  bought some clothes bought parents and myself watches for christmas and matched the amount on myself to give to a charity called cry when i surprised my parents with all that i was so fucking happy happiest ive been in a long time i genuinely want to help people not just get recognition but fuck maybe just a little would be nice i feel like a dick constantly even though i know im not ill just end this post here thanks for reading if you guys did i really needed to vent

through i only wish that you as my mom knew and my dad too how you make me feel when you berate me for minor things i know that youre trying to make me a finer man so i can bring pride knowing that you raised me as a fine person but i might worsen with sadness lurking as you make me feel like a bad person for not contributing enough or being lazy and stupid my mind is hazy and lucid at the same time and i am trying but im struggling to prove it cause ive lost motivation due to my depression this is my confession i feel worthless i know you wont believe me and telling you would prove fruitless i seem like a happy kid but i beat myself down you tell me that im smart you tell me that im cool but really i feel dumb like a fool but i shouldnt be in theory my life is good my parents are involved but my mood revolves from happy to gloomy in different times of day i never feel either side all the way except for my gloom in actuality in reality i never really feel happy only okay to no wait what am i saying it doesnt really matter you arent going to hear it so love me or not i often feel the latter even though in my heart i know its the former but rather tough or harsh or misguided love and even if i dont believe in god if hes up there i hope that he can see from abroad that i need something that i dont get right now and that is appreciation but every time you yell at me all i feel is depreciation i know youre just trying to prepare me for the real world but i feel burdened or maybe i should feel that way either way my true feelings are furled and curled up into a ball and thrown deep into the caves of my brain dont know why im feeling this way maybe i am lazy maybe i am stupid or maybe these problems are more deeply rooted whatever the answer im doubting myself but deep inside im thinking why help thyself i cant and i have no one to turn to i wish i was happy i wish that were true im not perfect so maybe i can learn too but i hope that someone understands me then someone can listen empathetically as i let out my emotions pathetically this is nearing the end so to everyone listening i hope that this suffices just know that id never harbor vices to the people that made me and raised me as who i am today but when i feel truly happy again then thatd be the day that i have finally finally broken out of my gloomy daze,pre,male,i m wrote a

before hand that im currently medicated and seeing a therapist and just need somewhere to talk amp x b everything was going fairly well until last semester spring  where depression which previously barely manifested itself seemed to hit me out of no where and all of a sudden i could barely get out of my room for classes i no longer enjoyed the things i used to and had nearly no energy at all because of this my grades went down though i managed to pass all my classes except for one which i dropped part way into the semester amp x b i love my school though it is difficult i have found success there in the past and i have a small but good group of friends there though i do find it hard to socialize and often tend to be feel alone this summer working on my online courses ive found it even harder to get motivated and do work compared to back at college and this has led to one of my courses grades going in the toilet the problem with this is that my parents told me that theyre viewing these summer courses as sort of a trial period to see if i can get myself together enough to send me back to my college or if i need to transfer to a more local college the only problem is that i dont want to change colleges and just know that whatever i try to do to convince myself otherwise that if i change colleges and goo back home i will always view myself as a failure and the

have to do work even though we lack motivation and yet it feels like theres some rope tethering me to my room and making it impossible to do work my st semester freshman year i faced a similar

before finals and the thought of failing and my poor performance up to that point pissed me off and i was angry with myself for letting things get so bad so i directed that anger to studying i

for a while im exhausted in every way that you can be im m married to hs sweetheart amazing little kids im an rn and have a cake job by nursing standards i have seniority and have great coworkers but i can barely pull myself out of bed to get to work and thats the easy part its like pulling teeth trying to get me to get anything done at work i sit there exhausted and zoning out and then work in spurts to make sure i do what i need to i think about suicide constantly but have only felt legitimately scared for my safety once a year or so ago ive lost a couple of very close friends recently one to suicide and i think of them daily thats the only real tangible thing i can point to that saddens me ive struggled with what i would call depression and anxiety for about years on and off meds at times diagnosed at different time depresson anxiety zoloft still on low dose lexapro worked ok wellbutrin gave me more anxiety rule out bipolar lamictal made my hair thin trileptal just stopped taking saw no change and low dose abilify made me hypomanic for a couple weeks until i stopped taking and add adderall xr actually helped my mood energy quite a bit but it would make me feel a little out of it my symptoms mainly inability to sit still or concentrate most of the time unless its something i find particularly interesting this started in junior high and continued through multiple degrees i would just cram for tests assignments and always did well tired constantly and recently feeling extreme anhedonia at times im extremely nostalgic and all of my memories even happy ones just make me sad at this point its very difficult for me to listen to a lot of music as it all reminds me of the past and i get sad im extremely vigilant and it causes me to always be somewhat agitated its hard for me to ever totally relax and enjoy myself without substances when at work i always feel out of it like im walking through a dream kind of thin ive always been weird about senses the way my clothes fit touching certain textures substances etc and for multiple reasons my wife believes i may be somewhere on the autism spectrum substance abuse long family history of alcoholism and i struggled myself before more in control now i have also struggled with low dose opiate hydrocodone and tramadol use opiates make me extremely euphoric good things ive done quit smoking completely a year ago though i was a very light smoker my eating habits over the past few months have been great compared to how they were the last few years mostly binging sugary foods im kind of giving up after a handful of meds and diagnoses over the years i guess im writing hoping that someone will have insight into what may be my proper diagnosis so i can really try to address it im not suicidal but i feel like i

78,depression,2019-04-07,i dont know what to do with my life anymore it just feels like its over i m really feel bad posting on here since i havent helped anyone else out i just feel so empty inside i used to be a great guy who was a track captain marching band leader student council gpa and all that i was the golden child but on top of that i wanted to help out other people who are less fortunate i used to go every week to the food pantry to volunteer i used to stay up nights with people going through what im going through right now and every summer i used to go abroad to a third world nation and volunteer in medical brigades because i used to want to work with doctors without borders as a career all of this is because i believed no one deserved to suffer but i feel like im one of the few people in the world who believe that and that everyone wants to see me suffer that really all changed when depression hit one girl did something that drove my best friend and me apart and then that best friend went on to alienate me from everyone thats where it all started from there it was just a rabbit hole of getting sadder until i wasnt able to be happy at all even when things were going right i was hospitalized twice from suicide attempts i seek therapy but its not helping yall know how it is through many of the initial stages i had my schools marching band to be a support group for me i had been kicked out of a lot of the things i was in but the marching band and the summer brigades i went on felt like the only places where i really belonged we had a groupchat we called the support squad the marching band lost some of our members to suicide and we had all agreed to help each other out and i used to help out others on that chat but i never really sought help from them because i didnt want to be a burden the same way i feel right now but one day my band friends who i trusted more than anyone went to my band director and spread a bunch of lies and got me kicked out the band director believed me but he still kicked me out cuz i was too negative that was really it for me even when i was positive after getting mostly cured of depression with my hospital stays he still wouldnt take me back no one wants me back whats the point of even trying if im the only one i know who wants to get better i feel like its a cycle of i get depressed people make it worse i attempt suicide those same people cry for me and say things like im always here for you i get better and more positive and then everyone shuts me out again making me depressed and so on i cant go back to the hospital i dont know what to do anymore my parents are going to take me out of the summer brigades cuz of my dipped grades due to my lack of motivation and then i will really be good for nothing im sorry for ranting its been on my chest and i have no one to go to which is why im glad i discovered this all i wanted to do was be a normal kid and help the world out i wanted to go to parties and have fun with friends and do things like prom and mall runs but that was all robbed from me i had to dip my own birthday party yesterday and go cry in my car because my friends will do anything to hurt me i wanted to be a guiding light for everyone even more so now that i know what its like to suffer but im just not the help and the great person i used to be and sometimes i feel

79,depression,2019-04-07,stressed depressed and riddled with guilt and regret wasnt really sure where to put this so thought this would be the best place if there is a better sub reddit for this let me know also sorry this is a long one i m just realised how badly i treated my so three years ago this happened when i was i was going out with this amazing girl my first gf and everything was going great i had just started uni got myself a part time job and met the first girl i truly enjoyed spending time with however as time went on about months into the relationship i started to lose interest in everything found myself not wanting to do anything i even struggled to get an erection with my gf i was feeling constantly exhausted and just found myself not wanting to get out of bed just felt completely disconnected with everyone and everything now after all this happening to me everything coming together somehow depression never even crossed my mind but i started pushing her away without even realising what i was doing at times ghosting her for a week at a time it wasnt just her it was all of my friends basically became a shut in i was stressing out about uni because i wasnt doing well i had realised i was spending more time on my job and gf than i was on my studying i started getting filled with anxiety about fucking up uni and losing all my hard work i had put in to get where i was without realising it i pushed her away and we had what should have been a small argument about how i had been getting more distant instead i took offence to it because i thought she was being unreasonable at the time right in the middle of my exam period to be pulling me up for being more distant when i was stressed beyond belief i saw this fight as an escape route but i never actually properly broke up with her turned out it would be the last time i would ever see her we ended up ghosting each other i am  sure she was waiting on me to text or call her making me the biggest pos in existence as well creating at this point in my life my worst decision i have ever made but that wasnt the real me i am kind caring and the last thing i would ever want to do is hurt someone that cares about me i was just mentally fucked up and didnt even realise it for the next years after all of this happened i did uni work which stressed me out i played competitive video games which stressed me out and i went out every week at least twice which made me tired so i wasnt helping myself and being unhealthy but i just wanted to be constantly busy so i wasnt left with my thoughts at this point i was at my lowest constantly considering of killing myself failing at uni alone with a good group of friends and my family not wanting to get out of bed and just completely done with life i was still in complete denial that i had depression how can i have depression i have great friends and family and im on the course ive always wanted to do i get food on my plate every day i can get clean water whenever i want what right do i have to be depressed however one day when i was having one of the worst panic attacks ive ever had worrying about all the uni work my dissertation my exams my assignments my groups projects i didnt touch my phone and ghosted everyone much like i had done years prior which for the first time ever triggered a thought within me that something wasnt right i was just watching shite on youtube as per usual and i saw this video with stormzy talking about how depression had gotten to him it suddenly hit me like a truck going at the speed of light if that guy can get depressed someone who reached peak of music got awards and tonnes of money is depressed then i sure as hell can get depressed i suddenly realised that thinking of getting run over by a bus just so i wouldnt have to go to uni wasnt normal thinking thinking aww maybe if i just let it run over my legs just so i couldnt walk would mean i wouldnt have to go to uni i realised too late in fact it was uni that had been my source of depression well fucking duh i however stupidly was very embarrassed that i had depression so i hid it i aint no fuckin pussy i remember thinking to myself so i didnt tell anyone kept going on about it my final year of uni i completely fucked it up beyond belief nailed my dissertation but failed every single class that year i went out after my last exam knowing i had fucked all of my exams with my uni pals i was in such a bad state of mind i wanted to go out get blind drunk and take every drug under the sun just so i could feel something positive for once looking back i think i was hoping the drugs would kill me but thankfully they didnt i woke up in some girls flat no idea where the actual fuck i was with her trying to pull my trousers and boxers down i just went with it because well tbh i had no fucking clue what was going on i kept blacking out throughout it turns out i had taken way too many drugs and my dick was smaller than a raisin could have also been the depression but feel drugs were more likely for this case she got offended that i wasnt turned on by her and she kicked me out her flat into the cold night i would like to add that this was a rare occurrence because i hadnt been interested in anyobe sexually other than porn since things ended with my gf i luckily still had my phone and called one of my best pals who turns out lived right around the corner from this girls flat he rescued me and i stayed at his i then realised that i should get help i told my mum and dad that i thought i was depressed and that i had been feeling suicidal and wanting to harm myself i was so scared to tell them now i cant think why i was scared but i was shaking out of fear they were immediately so supportive and have been helping me through it ever since dad has bupa family cover so i was able to see a physiologist and i have been seeing him ever since i now have a full time job in engineering the field i wanted to go into i was starting to get back on my feet finding interests again wanting to learn new stuff again just wanting to do everything it was amazing it was like i had these weights on my shoulders just lifted off and i had been wearing dreary filter glasses all that time so i decided that i would be interested in dating again immediately met this girl we got on really well cutting a long story short she broke up with me in a pretty shitty way not nearly as bad as mine which then brings us to today i have just come to the realisation of how much of a piece of shit i was to my first gf and frankly embarrassed how long it took me to realise it but as i said earlier i havent been myself for years without even realising it so here comes the questions i wanted to reach out to her and apologise and ask to meet up so i can

87,depression,2019-01-08,story of my miserable life so to start this off im m and the formatting probably sucks because im on my phone so i apologize in advance im just trying to tell my story in hopes it will connect with someone and they can share their similar situations ill start it off when i was i was a quite niave lad young and dumb i suppose but one day my life had changed forever i was in the basement of my grandmothers house me and my mom lived there most of my childhood i heard a bunch of noises coming from upstairs so i ran up there i didnt really know what to expect when i got to the top of the stairs my uncle and my grandmother were sitting at the dinner table crying my uncle ran and picked me up once he seen me and held me in the arms he pulled me close to him and said im so sorry op your mother passed away i was shocked but for some reason i didnt cry i just held all of my emotions back and i felt nothing still today i dont know why maybe because i didnt fully comprehend what was happening later on in my life i found out that she had killed herself i always had a thought in the back of my head that it was me and it kinda never left me anyways fast forward a couple years to when im i had been staying with my grandmother my dad wasnt around most of my life she had gotten to quite an old age and her mind was slowing fading my dad came in from wherever probably the third time i had ever seen him and decided to stay with us he noticed my grandmothers behavior and said it wasnt normal her waking me up at am saying it was time for school my dad took me out of the house and i moved in with his sister his sister was a straight up b my grandmother had saved  dollars for me from my ssi money and was saving it to get me a car when she got her greedy ass hands on it she bought herself a new car it wasnt till i was that i understood what was going on they had sold my playstation while i was gone and said they had no idea where it was once i seen how greedy they were i left and went to go back and live with my grandmother her alzheimers disease has tremendously increased since i was she cried every night after i left which ultimately sent her farther and farther down into the disease when i got back to her house she did not even recognize me i was so depressed because i felt like it was all my fault from where i left i still do no i got back though my other aunt was living with her taking care of her she passed away in the later years she was bedridden from a stroke and slowly drifted away i was depressed for a long time over this and still am today i always think that if i would have stayed i would have prevented her downfall i stayed with my aunt till i was i thought she was different but she wasnt she said she was saving up my ssi for when i moved out little did i know she was using it for hair extensions and what not well i met this girl when i was she was absolutely stunning she was weird funny smart and such a

fought alot after that everyday it was heated discussions about my girlfriend and me so i left i packed my shit and i left i went and lived with my girlfriends parents for months and they were more of a family to me than my own now im here im living with my fiance aka that weird funny and beautiful girl from the story and we have a dog and cats i love my life now for awhile i wanted to kill myself but i put my family in the past and started worrying about me and later on down the road i will have a child and i will show him the affection i never got sorry for the long post i just had to get it off my chest ,pre,male,story of my miserable life so to start this off im m and the formatting probably sucks because im on my phone so i apologize in advance im just trying to tell my story in hopes it will connect with someone and they can share their similar situations ill start it off when i was i was a quite niave lad young and dumb i suppose but one day my life had changed forever i was in the basement of my grandmothers house me and my mom lived there most of my childhood i heard a bunch of noises coming from upstairs so i ran up there i didnt really know what to expect when i got to the top of the stairs my uncle and my grandmother were sitting at the dinner table crying my uncle ran and picked me up once he seen me and held me in the arms he pulled me close to him and said im so sorry op your mother passed away i was shocked but for some reason i didnt cry i just held all of my emotions back and i felt nothing still today i dont know why maybe because i didnt fully comprehend what was happening later on in my life i found out that she had killed herself i always had a thought in the back of my head that it was me and it kinda never left me anyways fast forward a couple years to when im i had been staying with my grandmother my dad wasnt around most of my life she had gotten to quite an old age and her mind was slowing fading my dad came in from wherever probably the third time i had ever seen him and decided to stay with us he noticed my grandmothers behavior and said it wasnt normal her waking me up at am saying it was time for school my dad took me out of the house and i moved in with his sister his sister was a straight up b my grandmother had saved  dollars for me from my ssi money and was saving it to get me a car when she got her greedy ass hands on it she bought herself a new car it wasnt till i was that i understood what was going on they had sold my playstation while i was gone and said they had no idea where it was once i seen how greedy they were i left and went to go back and live with my grandmother her alzheimers disease has tremendously increased since i was she cried every night after i left which ultimately sent her farther and farther down into the disease when i got back to her house she did not even recognize me i was so depressed because i felt like it was all my fault from where i left i still do no i got back though my other aunt was living with her taking care of her she passed away in the later years she was bedridden from a stroke and slowly drifted away i was depressed for a long time over this and still am today i always think that if i would have stayed i would have prevented her downfall i stayed with my aunt till i was i thought she was different but she wasnt she said she was saving up my ssi for when i moved out little did i know she was using it for hair extensions and what not well i met this girl when i was she was absolutely stunning she was weird funny smart and such a philosophical

day we met he always had that gloomy sad vibe to him but you know i just found it mysterious and interesting weve been dating for a few months everything was awesome hanging out everyday having awesome sex life best friends in general as the time went by he was opening more and more about his past very abusive childhood was left alone at the very early age money struggles etc and he admitted to suffer from depression he has been diagnosed by a professional but not taking any medication or going to therapies i noticed that he had some pretty bad days sometimes when he would close himself in his apartment and wouldnt answer my calls messages or door rings few days later he would just appear out of nowhere like nothing happened and we would go on with our lives i always tried to talk to him about it but he always refused he would even go home from our meeting if i was too pushy but it was happening about once in two months and after that we could function normally i guessed he just needed some time alone sometimes to clear his head and relax after a year or so those periods become more frequent like twice a month our relationship was still the same love birds but had sex only once in a month tried to talk to him but refused and blamed it on stress things were getting worse but he stopped closing himself in and instead just started telling me he feels bad or very bad i tried to take most of his daily tasks off of his back like cooking making appointments paying bills etc so he would feel less stressed about daily life now after years since we met we barely talk about anything about him only about movies reddit events people we know etc when were not together we dont talk at all not responding to my messages calls or anything just an occasional i feel very bad last time we had sex was months ago and before that we had sex times last year not that its the most important thing but you know i noticed it for months now ive been trying to gently guide him

113,depression,2019-08-26,need some advice so to begin i have mild depression and anxiety i think but basically it was really really bad last year but this year it has gotten way better but its definitely still there i take some meds which help tremendously but recently it seems the depression is starting to spike back up again i think its starting back up for various reasons first of all im m now and i still dont think i really look like an adult or close too one reason being i think im too short for one even though my height is actually ok its so not bad and i may be still growing and also i always thought my hair and clothes looked bad so i decided to learn how to match clothes better and properly style hair i workout more and it helps but for some reason i still think no matter what i look just too young and not good enough even though deep down i think i actually look pretty good but my head is much louder then my heart because of this i always have the urge to look in the mirror all the time which wastes time and impacts my grades but when i look at the mirror im determined i still look bad and waste even more time in there i find myself comparing me to other guys and such which ive tried to end i get very anxious but its weird because sometimes i dont feel anything and i can talk and such fine and other times i fell awkward and not good enough my conditions are very random and some days i may never be upset until someone says one little bad thing or does something bad to me what also sucks is ive never actually had a gf which i long for and i feel like none of my friends actually are that close to me to begin with i cant really explain it but i just feel very alone and when i think about what to do after high school i get sadder because i think i may be even more alone i dont really have a plan for college and a job yet and i dont even drive which makes me stress and kinda freakout earlier this year i felt much better because of the meds and felt like no matter what i looked awesome and im amazing no matter what and that things will workout and all will be fine issue being the depression has seemed to spike up again as previously mentioned i do have a best friend who i love very much i have known her for years and we were so close and i always looked forward to seeing her so i think shes pretty cute and kind and such so i eventually fell in love with her last year and told her my feelings though i found out she liked someone else ever since then i was upset but it got better and we just kept fighting and argued im not even sure why but i was upset at some choice she would make and would get pissed and wouldnt want to see her for some time though i think that broke our relationship as we are not as close as best friends anymore for various reasons i have paid attention too i can just feel our relationship is basically no more she wants to hang with other friends more we dont take about personal stuff we dont test anymore she gets mad if i ask about her personal life and she basically dosent seem to be excited to see me but is around others when i confronted her about this she said she dosent feel like anything is wrong but i know for a fact it is and it hurts tremendously she also used to say nice things about my appearance and it was really uplifting but now i see her say my guy friends are cute whenever im with them but she never says anything about me anymore she dosent give me hugs and shows affection anymore sometimes i wish she would just hug me and say something nice like your hair looks good today or something but that seems like its over and the final issue is i have been wrestling for years ever since my dad forced me into it in rd grade presently i cant stand wrestling anymore and cant even stand going into a gym during a tournament im so burnt out and such i just dotn find it fun and i want some more free time as i feel like i always have so much to do though i feel like i cant leave because my parents say i have too and cant leave and that ill regret it if i leave my final year but honestly i dont think so as im just really depressed and alone feeling sometimes i only look forward to sleeping anyway that was all i wanted to say thanks to anyone for reading through this i mostly just wanted to get this out but if you can give any advice on anything i would absolutely

since years and help since i know her its not really about me instead more about nikol but i would appreciate everyones advice and support also im not sure if this is the right community and honestly really dont know where to start the story because its way too bizarre to understand or believe it but ill try anyway nikol was born with cancer is allergic to the sun has bad luck in life and is innocent since always because her parents have never loved or cared about her all they ever did was abuse mentally physically and talk bad for no reason her father is actually not really her father

141,depression,2020-01-03,the difference between situational depression adjustment disorder and the idea that depression follows you everywhere i am writing this post because of what i am currently experiencing quick stats m in college working part time at a machine shop live with family life is great from an outsiders viewpoint and it should be great i do well in college without trying too hard i love my apprenticeship i have some really cool hobbies and own some really nice things everybody tells me that ill amount to something great i tend to think in a different way than most people can elaborate on that not bragging sometimes its a disadvantage if you didnt guess already i was a gifted kid maybe thats what screwed me up it seems that neither myself nor anyone i speak to can prove anything as the culprit but my life isnt great about of the day goes by relatively ok but starting about a year ago december  i lost the ability to have hope and to deal with the other my hobbies working on my old truck shooting shotguns collecting things geocaching etc have become much less enjoyable ill save the rest of the symptoms list unfortunately you guys know all about them but the main ones have been losing interest in good things thinking about death way too much but no plans for an early demise and anticipating that my future life will be shit that is the part of the day where i encounter hardships and worry about my current and future life i went to several therapists who did not seem to believe that i have clinical major depression theres nothing to suggest it two of them believe that i could be labeled under adjustment disorder which to my understanding roughly translates to situational depression in my situation its situational as hell thats for sure heres a basic version of what happens ill use an analogy which has actually happened over two dozen times in the last six months i am working on a project in the garage an expensive part or operation is somehow damaged or otherwise fails to work successfully i rightfully recognize that the damage will cost  which is two weeks pay thats two weeks of extra work two weeks of grinding two weeks without my prized truck i start thinking instantly about how badly i screwed up about how i cant even complete a simple task about how big of a deal this is then i realize that its my own fault i chose to bow down to my parents and go to college adding stress to my life i chose to only be able to work part time i chose to have limited funds and free time and at that point i see life as boring futile and in some cases not worth living and thats a stupid example too it can be anything a screwup at work a hard day at school a traffic jam which results in missing something important to me family reinforcing the idea that my life will suck in the future etc basically something triggers it always a failure or delay or hardship of some sore i think way too much and spiral into a depressed state and i stay there anywhere from an hour to almost the whole day but its not there  only when i feel unable to do something important whether or not im at fault situational and i hope that it improves when i was in high school it was even worse i had much less money and time the things i do now were only dreams i had so much hope for my future i thought i would skip college work for a few years save up buy a few acres and build my ideal life literally by hand if you cant tell im a bit of a redneck i like working with my hands and building fixing things it can make and save you a lot of money it could get me to where i want to be i chose to live at home go to college not make enough money to fuel my needs and desires and i cant get out for two more years i have a lot of hope though that after i am free from my shackles that i will have an easier and more enjoyable life at this point you can choose to ignore everything above and instead focus on my question ask me things about my situation or offer advice im mainly here for option a but i thought id explain myself first i can post some writings ive done that explain my situation and thought processes in greater detail hell maybe i dont even belong here maybe im a normal person who cant get a grip on simple things id still like to know obviously situational depression is just that situational in theory it subsides once the problem is over i also hear this advice commonly echoed  wont fix you  is usually travel dating sex drugs rightfully so a new job a new city wherever you go there you are depression follows you you cant run from it forever do these saying have any meaning to a situation like mine whats the difference between having hope an end in sight a goal which ends the perceived source of your problems and wanting to

ways to better myself and relieve myself of some of the pain i deal with but to no avail i have am in a ltr with my wonderful and successful girlfriend whos on her way to having the world in her hands i have my own apartment a job that i hate but pays the bills at the end of the day even though i work an inhumane amount of hours and i can pay my bills and have been able to afford a car i take of my finances very well and have high credit and all of the other snazzy things i also see a therapist and psychiatrist which has diagnosed me with clinical depression and anxiety and am currently on my third bout of meds with bupropion mg and buspar mg though they do nothing i exercise sort of regularly with the little free time i have and always try to remain efficient and maximize my free time taking part time classes online and handling my responsibilities as a young adult now despite that i hate myself i hate looking at myself havent looked in a mirror in months i dont know who i am and i spend the day driving myself crazy internally nothing seems to work for me and im tired of initiating paths and goals for them to fail and collapse in front of me i took classes at a university nearby this past fall while working and got into a car accident because i was just frankly doing way too much but i just wanted to feel like i was doing something for myself i try to eat a healthy diet and follow proper regimes but i cant seem to get the results i want and have wasted a lot of money throughout the process and i honestly just dont know what to do i dont know where i am where im going and whats going to happen to me i dont have many friends and many do not know of me and my personal battles and struggles i speak to my leadership for advice but it just doesnt click i feel alone and fading and i dont have much to build off of in this new year to sum it up im just asking for assistance and advice in what i can do what routes to take to get better and maybe function and be content with my life one day any help is appreciated and if youve read all this i thank you tldr high functioning depressed young male proactive and willing to do the work to get better but nothing has worked

found out when someone there told her and my depression has only got worse im not numb anymore i just feel guilty and psyically sick but what makes me feel worse is the way i process that guilt i know its messed up and unhealthy but its the only way it works i deserved to be broken up with i cheated and im an asshole i know that i was never a good boyfriend even before this so we broke up but a few days letter she messaged me that she forgives me and we should stay friends even though she said she forgives me i dont think i deserve her forgiveness and her saying that just made me feel even more guilty because i know i hurt a kind person i was brought up by pretty aggressive people where when you upset angered betrayed someone you got hurt even if it wasnt always deserved now i think i

182,depression,2020-01-15,i guess i just need to let some stuff out sorry if this kind of goes all over the place or is confusing i guess ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for the better part of or so years most of it i think ends up revolving around school ive never been diagnosed or anything and i always felt it got better eventually so i never really reached out to a therapist or doctor or anything i m just entered my last semester of college i was ecstatic i graduated high school in and have been struggling to finish balancing working full time and school every semester around the beginning mostly but several times throughout i start to get a lot of anxiety and i get really sad about everything the work seems overwhelming and i cant help but think of all the time i have to dedicate to do well and how i wont have time for myself really i end up working all day doing homework when i get home walk my dog and play with him a little because i feel bad neglecting him but he is my best friend and then usually watch some tv before bed my off days from work are filled with school and classes so it feels like i never get a break this time when i started the semester on monday i was welcomed with a ton of work for the semester and a ton of work for the first assignment i would say maybe weeks of work and research due in week not to mention i still have other classes that start on thursday i was really really hoping for an easy last semester with maybe one class that requires a lot of work but now it seems like this semester will be the hardest yet i should mention i go to school for digital media lots of design work and branding and marketing especially marketing and branding ourselves lots of projects and research i know its not the end of the world lots of people have a ton of work for college there are harder degrees out there but for some reason this really really affected me i had a panic attack after class and sobbed in my car for some reason not sure if this has anything to do with anything but i also slammed my finger in my car door last thursday and its been healing slowly doctors basically just tell me that you just have to let it heal on its own but its been giving me a lot of anxiety anyways after monday i just felt worse than i ever have before ive been so depressed its been hard to do anything at work im quiet and keep to myself once i get home im tired and just wanna lay down and nap yesterday instead of working on homework when i got home i just felt so exhausted i fell asleep on the couch i had to force myself up to walk and feed my dog i havent had any appetite and have been forcing myself to eat because i know i need to eat something ive hardly been eating anything though parts of sandwiches some fries maybe and then i feel full or nauseous and cant finish it this is worse than ive ever felt and i cant seem to shake it i just want to feel normal again and i dont want to be sad and tired all the time my fiancee f has been very supportive but we are in a long distance relationship until this summer shes been away for over a year now and i proposed back in october she tries to talk to me as much as she can but throughout the day she is at work and of course gets busy i totally understand that but i really look forward to getting her messages because it makes me feel just a little better im really hoping that after this week or so things start going back to normal i keep telling myself its only more months and ill be done and all my hard work will have paid off but i just cant seem to feel better i cry in the morning on my lunch break on my way home from work and once i get home i just wish there was a way to make this just go away again sorry if this was all over the place or hard to understand i just felt like i needed to get it off my chest as i dont really have many people to express these feelings to and i dont want to overwhelm my fiancee because she isnt a therapist she

on monday i was welcomed with a ton of work for the semester and a ton of work for the first assignment i would say maybe weeks of work and research due in week not to mention i still have other classes that start on thursday i was really really hoping for an easy last semester with maybe one class that requires a lot of work but now it seems like this semester will be the hardest yet i should mention i go to school for digital media lots of design work and branding and marketing especially marketing and branding ourselves lots of projects and research i know its not the end of the world lots of people have a ton of work for college there are harder degrees out there but for some reason this really really affected me i had a panic attack after class and sobbed in my car for some reason not sure if this has anything to do with anything but i also slammed my finger in my car door last thursday and its been healing slowly doctors basically just tell me that you just have to let it heal on its own but its been giving me a lot of anxiety anyways after monday i just felt worse than i ever have before ive been so depressed its been hard to do anything at work im quiet and keep to myself once i get home im tired and just wanna lay down and nap yesterday instead of working on homework when i got home i just felt so exhausted i fell asleep on the couch i had to force myself up to walk and feed my dog i havent had any appetite and have been forcing myself to eat because i know i need to eat something ive hardly been eating anything though parts of sandwiches some fries maybe and then i feel full or nauseous and cant finish it this is worse than ive ever felt and i cant seem to shake it i just want to feel normal again and i dont want to be sad and tired all the time my fiancee f has been very supportive but we are in a long distance relationship until this summer shes been away for over a year now and i proposed back in october she tries to talk to me as much as she can but throughout the day she is at work and of course gets busy i totally understand that but i really look forward to getting her messages because it makes me feel just a little better im really hoping that after this week or so things start going back to normal i keep telling myself its only more months and ill be done and all my hard work will have paid off but i just cant seem to feel better i cry in the morning on my lunch break on my way home from work and once i get home i just wish there was a way to make this just go away again sorry if this was all over the place or hard to understand i just felt like i needed to get it off my chest as i dont really have many people to express these feelings to and i dont want to overwhelm my fiancee because she isnt a therapist she doesnt deserve to bear the weight of her stress and also mine anyways thanks for reading i guess and thanks for having this place available,post,male,i guess i just need to let some stuff out sorry if this kind of goes all over the place or is confusing i guess ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for the better part of or so years most of it i think ends up revolving around school ive never been diagnosed or anything and i always felt it got better eventually so i never really reached out to a therapist or doctor or anything i m just entered my last semester of college i was ecstatic i graduated high school in and have been struggling to finish balancing working full time and school every semester around the beginning mostly but several times throughout i start to get a lot of anxiety and i get really sad about everything the work seems overwhelming and i cant help but think of all the time i have to dedicate to do well and how i wont have time for myself really i end up working all day doing homework when i get home walk my dog and play with him a little because i feel bad neglecting him but he is my best friend and then usually watch some tv before bed my off

weed well out of moderation while i have never been diagnosed i feel that i suffer from depression and anxiety on friday my fianc called me out on my porn addiction at some point she went through my phone and saw my alternate reddit account specifically for nsfw stuff i also subscribed to personal adds and hook up based reddits i never planned on responding to them i just found something appealing about seeing the posts my jaw dropped when she was telling me about her discoveries i always silently judged myself and hated myself for this addiction i even told her as we were talking about it that i have never talked about it with anyone or expressed these feelings in any way she was cheated on before and she said this felt like a worse betrayal that she felt i would rather jerk off than be with her i told her this simply isnt true the two reasons i feel i do it are when its late and i cant sleep or when im alone depressed and need to feel something i told her i dont want to wake her up at am for a lazy fuck i told her the last thing i wanted to do was make her feel insecure and that i only had myself to blame for all this i needed this wake up call and started making changes our communication hasnt been good lately and i asked her to help me be a better communicator as i would be trying to better myself i got rid of all my porn files all the stuff i had easily accessible i unsubscribed to a lot of the reddits on my nsfw account and hope to be rid of the account some day i recently got my license to do life insurance and am starting with a new company we spent all weekend being lovers and it has been nice but all that loving threw my back out for the last couple days so i wasnt able to perform then this morning i woke up at around am she usually sleeps in i woke up and had the urge i thought it would have been selfish to wake her up to ask for a blowjob and my back was still completely out of the game i started taking care of myself in the living room and eventually she came out and knew what i was doing i tried to quickly explain myself and said im sorry my back is still fucked and i didnt want to wake you again i thought it would be selfish to wake her and request anything of her especially when i couldnt reciprocate she sent me a lengthy text and told me she is considering couples therapy which i am absolutely for i love her to

189,depression,2020-01-17,been able to successfully keep myself out of bouts of deep depression for years but a recent demotion at work has deflated me any advice or reassurance that anybody whos been in the same boat might be able to offer i m work at a decently big car repair shop and have for about three years i was promoted about four or five months back into my first real position after doing the equivalent of car shop grunt work for two and a half years hooray and was initially very excited for my first employee review this week having had troubles with emotional imbalance and bouts of severe depression in the past ive been thinking recently about how much ive improved since i started this position all my new coworkers at the new building love me and tell me im doing an amazing job i made friends i can actually talk to about shared interests during lunch for the first time in years i could see plenty of room to grow in the company ahead of me all seemed to be going great but i was called into my boss office today for evaluation and was told the worst thing they could have told me besides firing me outright they would not be reexamining my pay which i wasnt too concerned about a little raise would have been nice but i would have understood and id be required to go back to the grunt work position i had before if i wanted to keep my job this is due to company restructuring and not my personal performance supposedly but being blindsided by this hit me like a ton of bricks and i had my first bad anxiety attack in years to the point where i was hyperventilating like crazy and almost passed out a few times my now former i guess boss was very understanding thankfully about me kind of breaking down in his office and said he would push for advancement opportunities for me in the future but after almost three years of busting ass and doing my best to make my way up even just a little bit in this company it feels like all ive put in has been for nothing and it brought all my old anxiety symptoms rushing back i dont want to make myself miserable for potentially years until a new opportunity at the company opens up for me and considering how i havent even done anything wrong to deserve this demotion its really taken the wind out of my sails as far as my general work ethic is concerned i feel like ive put in all this energy just to get booted back to where i was but with a slightly better paycheck i dont know i just needed to spiel because ive been beating myself up over this for hours i dont know whether to quit and look for a place that has a better chance of treating my work ethic right or just stick it out in my old shitty job im kind of thankful i still have a job at all but the fact that its the position i crawled my way out of with a ton of effort and perseverance so i would have a more fulfilling role in the company it just feels like a real kick in the teeth i might need advice or i might just need some moral support im really conflicted as to how to process all of this right now and what i should do from here ,post,male,been able to successfully keep myself out of bouts of deep depression for

have told me besides firing me outright they would not be reexamining my pay which i wasnt too concerned about a little raise would have been nice but i would have understood and id be required to go back to the grunt work position i had before if i wanted to keep my job this is due to company restructuring and not my personal performance supposedly but being blindsided by this hit me like a ton of bricks and i had my first bad anxiety attack in years to the point where i was hyperventilating like crazy and almost passed out a few times my now former i guess boss was very understanding thankfully about me kind of breaking down in his office and said he would push for advancement opportunities for me in the future but after almost three years of busting ass and doing my best to make my way up even just a little bit in this company it feels like all ive put in has been for nothing and it brought all my old anxiety symptoms rushing back i dont want to make myself miserable for potentially years until a new opportunity at the company opens up for me and considering how i havent even done anything wrong to deserve this demotion its really taken the wind out of my sails as far as my general work ethic is concerned i feel like ive put in all this energy just to get booted back to where i was but with a slightly better paycheck i dont know i just needed to spiel because ive been beating myself up over this for hours i dont know whether to quit and look for a place that has a better chance of treating my work ethic right or just stick it out in my old shitty job im kind of thankful i still have a job at all but the fact that its the position i crawled my way out of with a ton of effort and perseverance so i would have a more fulfilling role in the company it just feels like a real kick in the teeth i might need advice or i might just need some moral support im really conflicted as to how to process all of this right now and what i should do from here

190,depression,2020-01-17,deepest ive ever been its time to get something off my chest the entire story no softening i really hope this wont get drowned under new posts and wont get seen this is a very long post filled with sadness dont read if you dont feel like it no tldrs here my apologies for swearing im years old and please dont take this in an arrogant way because i dont know how else to word it highly intelligent my entire life be it school uni work gaming whatever im just good at whatever i do usually one of the best yet i am as insecure as can be i dont like the way i look mainly the face i say stupid shit to friends and then regret it even though i know they probably forgot it the moment i walk through the door i think about freaking everything around when i was i was fucking up my school and started to dwindle down into sadness this got worse and worse to the point of depression and meetings with a psychologist this gave me some newfound strength and i pulled myself together and cleaned my room it was a freaking mess floor had multiple layers of trash maggots walking around plain fucking disgusting but i did it and it felt so good i had all the standard symptoms not able to get out of bed eating badly neglecting relationships with friends but worst of all lack of discipline and hygiene so for the past years i have barely brushed my teeth i cannot get myself to do it its such a stupid minor thing youd think its no problem but it is when i was my teeth were basically rotting away huge brown gap between my front teeth and many many more problems and the pain man the weirdest thing was that none of my friends or family ever said anything about it didnt they notice were they just being nice i was so insecure and ashamed of myself couldnt bare to look in the mirror then an aunt of mine with plenty money decided to jump in and offered to pay for the entire dentist plan to get everything fixed even though i am terrified of that fucking tooth doctor i was going to do this years of countless treatments around unimaginable pain teeth removed molars luckily and about k further i had the balls to laugh with teeth again it wasnt perfect it was yellow and it was a whole lot of clay but it was a set of teeth that people were allowed to see so all you have to do is just pick up the fucking toothbrush and maintain it right yeah now my teeth are quickly degrading to the same point as before and fuck man i hate myself back to the spiral of hating myself gt not getting out of bed gt hating myself more gt fucking everything up for the past year the depression has been at its worst its ever been committing suicide has become a daily thought when im laying in bed and summing up all the things im fucking up and all the shit ive said to people and regret i enter a very very dark hole then the morning comes and i go to work again i have talked about this with my best friends and family they support me with so much love but they cant fix me nor do i believe another psychologist can fix me i dont want be dependent on medication the funny thing is that except for my teeth for an outsider i would probably be described as someone who has his shit together some have even told me they look up to me and that i am special i have run my own software company for the past years with my best friends we have recently recruited our first employees we are moving into a new office space this saturday a whole floor for us and i currently earn an acceptable pay of k net with the outlook of growing hard i have a couple of beautiful friends who i can share everything with i love them to the moon and back i even have a few great hobbies everyone tells me how much they like me as a person and how they love it when im there but shit i just cant get a grip on it every day is another wave of sadness im just sticking around because people would fucking miss me oh and my mom i dont want to do that to you the thoughts are becoming more than just thoughts why live on this earth if i struggle with simple shit like brushing my teeth and just living in despair why keep dealing with it man i dont know anymore i might just freaking do it shit man i kinda wish i wasnt this intelligent even with all the cool perks you get learning analyzing fast logic manipulating a few pointers which might help understanding my fucked upness better i smoke a few joints about days a week been doing this since every now and then at parties i use some cocaine or mmc never out of line once every few months i had a very troubled youth my father was a heroin addict and my mother divorced him when i was since then my childhood has been a wishwash of moving times multiple schools and arguing parents i have always believed that my childhood has not affected my

of the relationship but she found out and tried to kill herself i then stayed in the relationship i felt chained up i started loving her again then she broke up with me two months later and she cut herself for braking up with me i was very confused and conflicted i then had to move schools due to me being threatened at the school being bashed and stabbed and all that i lost many people o considered brothers and sisters i then moved to the school im at and i found someone else to date we dated for a year and a half and through our that whole relationship she manipulated and made me feel wrong there was a time because i kept getting hard whilst spooning and i told her i didnt wanna do anything but she kept saying thats not right theres something wrong with you whats wrong with you it got that bad i had to go to the doctors about it she didnt care enough in the relationship to read articles i found to describe my anxiety and made me feel worthless we ended the relationship about two months ago and i tried to kill myself because i was having an existential life crisis and tried to control how i died and i just wanted the mental pain to end i had to restart my friends again because she made me push them away i had to go to the emergency ward twice because i nearly killed myself i hate that i still love her when she was horrible to me and i offered her the world and it sucks that my family doesnt understand me and my uncle said to me that i was trying to draw pity on myself and these where the reasons i closed up and when me and my ex broke up she told me she

people who dont go to my school i get along so well with all of these friends that when i think about my in school friends there are really only about or i enjoy being around those school friends are all ones i really dont talk to as much i dont know why i love being around them so much more than with others i have also recently taken a step back with my girlfriend due to her not wanting a full relationship right now which i didnt really mind but not all the way back to just friends as she put it  i have basically given up on trying anything and have just accepted the friend zone and begun to space myself a little bit so i dont feel too attached if she never comes back to me specifically she told me i was the right person at the wrong time i have a post up on r relationship advice if you want to read the specifics it is a little bit outdated now but it gives most of the context i am also going to try and separate from a couple friends in which are creating un needed worry stress in my life so i can focus on the last two years of school im from australia at school i feel happy i think like i really dont know i enjoy my time at lunch and recess with friends but it doesnt really feel like properly happy when i am playing games with my online friends i really do feel happy i enjoy my time we talk about whatever when queuing for another match or when deciding what game to play or after we have played and wanna just chill all of my good gamer friends follow me on instagram none of them are pedos which was relieving and we post pictures either for the hell of it or for whatever the reason be the friends that i play games with always like and leave funny or kind comments as well as a few of my out of school friends this makes me feel good about myself whether they

213,depression,2020-01-29, m losing hope suicidal thoughts emerging hey im just a random sophomore male in college living in the united states so what is my problem i feel like i wasted my entire life i know that might sound dramatic but here is why i grew up in a suburban middle class evangelical christian family to oversimplify things we were and still are the present time neither that particularly rich or poor you get the general picture i guess pretty sheltered from the world as well but i was too socially incompetent to have done anything regardless my time in public middle and high school can be generally characterized as a total waste teachers would always remark about how bright and lucid i was but i could never grasp the nuances of social interaction i have aspergers and thus spent the overwhelming majority of my time alone and away from others video games books and other forms of entertainment almost entirely consumed my time i ended up with mediocre grades from anxiety and transferred into community college i always knew that my social isolation from others was atypical but the full extent of my problems didnt hit until i realized awhile ago that the overwhelming majority of my peers are no longer virgins partied have developed stable social networks and are much more mentally advanced socially than i am i feel like a year old trapped in the body of someone far older people my age want to go to parties ive never even had a single true close friend in my life people want sex i just want someone to cuddle me etc im not even on the same level its left me all so insecure about myself i cringe at the realization that ive spent my entire life nearly friendless never in a relationship totally alienated from my generation and it feels like no one will never understand my problems im also deeply insecure about my own physical appearance or to put it more accurately how people react to it i get a strong sense of disgust every time i gaze upon my own reflection in the mirror its a topic that has caused me a great amount of self hatred i hate my appearance a casual glance at a site like snapchat or instagram shows how attractive men and women get adoration reverence and praise from just merely existing and me ive never been complimented on my appearance by a woman in my entire life it causes me to feel disgusting about myself like ill never be viewed as attractive it makes me feel ontologically inferior to them in some way or that reality is just playing a sick joke upon us all i cant help but feel a disgusted mix of sadness envy and repressed anger towards the world it all feels so random so meaningless ive dwelt on it to the point of being cynical about whether love truly exists theyll say that no one deserves love which only makes me hate myself anymore my social skills are non existent i never learned how to communicate with others impress women etc and the suggested help ive seen online from armchair commentators is even worse alone having trouble with the girls friends in general theyll urge you to go after the hollowest meaningless and hedonistic things in existence i see it now someone in the comments is ready to recommend visiting a strip club hiring a prostitute or watching pornography on your computer its absolutely ridiculous they just want you to shut up keep repeating crap about how the world will ultimately work out for you and wait for you to disappear from the face of it i still dont know how people easily obtain friendships etc the notion of someone other than family particularly caring about me honestly seems totally surreal like a dream youd come up to relieve yourself of sadness then cry as you realize that it is nothing more than such i just want someone to cuddle up next me i want to be loved i want friends and all of this seems forever out of my reach im also a kissless virgin who has never been in a relationship but im not necessarily depressed about it for the reasons that might be typical among my peers its less about the sex than the idea of a women finding me desirable important to her and i feel like the world is implicitly telling me that im too ugly insecure and meaningless to be loved im not unintelligent from an academic book knowledge mperspective i turned my grades around once i got motivated in college im currently riding with a gpa as a sophomore but it feels like elite schools like harvard yale etc are now impossible for me to reach regardless of my efforts any chance of that perished with my miserable years in high school my cc allows me to transfer to a top public university in our state but the whole notion still kind of stings me yeah cry me a river and all of that i always wanted to make music as a dream career i can create epic songs in my head etc i want to good at syntheizers think synthwave but i dont know if ill have the time now to ever become close to perficient ivd barely picked up an instrument before now so i dont even really know where to begin im uncertain what my career path in life will be after college im still taking prereqs now i felt forced to go to college by my parents still dont have a job still dont have a drivers license i dont even know if there is a good place for me to start off at i feel undesired unwanted and abandoned in a world that is either vindictive or uncaring about my entire existence being white male autistic socially awkward and a virgin all together at once carries a lot of negative connotations in modern day society so im afraid of what people would wrongly presume about me if i told anyone this in real life that im sexist dangerous etc i feel like the gap will make me inevitably disconnected from my peers i have no idea what a year old is supposed to have done by now do most people have friends do they go to parties im utterly disconnected from experiences that all of my peers have already done a lot of things that you are supposed to do as a teenager i utterly missed i just sat cried and got bored in my room every day how the freakin heck are you supposed to fix this in a relatively short period of time ill graduate in years it feels like ive missed the boat entirely ive never really had any close relations with my peers ever can you even fix your past im constantly overcome with the feeling of being unwanted and alone that my chance of accel at my goals is now past and that i should just lay over rot and die maybe ill survive maybe ill get a decent job but id just be a wageslaving for the next years all alone i just want to do something substantive in my life to experience the world to accomplish things to be the most moral and outstanding person i can be but i just fear that all of this has already passed am i wrong any tips any recommendations i feel like the days are going by and im doing nothing with them feel free to ask me anything about this ill respond relatively quickly im afraid of dying a cynical bitter man who wasted their entire life im already th of my way through my th year of life and i have no idea how to talk to people my childhood and adolescence is pretty much completely over and i learned nothing from it if im and things dont get better im tempted to find a legal way to kill myself somewhere i cant live like this ,post,male, m losing hope suicidal thoughts emerging hey im just a random

evangelical christian family to oversimplify things we were and still are the present time neither that particularly rich or poor you get the general picture i guess pretty sheltered from the world as well but i was too socially incompetent to have done anything regardless my time in public middle and high school can be generally characterized as a total waste teachers would always remark about how bright and lucid i was but i could never grasp the nuances of social interaction i have aspergers and thus spent the overwhelming majority of my time alone and away from others video games books and other forms of entertainment almost entirely consumed my time i ended up with mediocre grades from anxiety and transferred into community college i always knew that my social isolation from others was atypical but the full extent of my problems didnt hit until i realized awhile ago that the overwhelming majority of my peers are no longer virgins partied have developed stable social networks and are much more mentally advanced socially than i am i feel like a year old trapped in the body of someone far older people my age want to go to parties ive never even had a single true close friend in my life people want sex i just want someone to cuddle me etc im not even on the same level its left me all so insecure about myself i cringe at the realization that ive spent my entire life nearly friendless never in a relationship totally alienated from my generation and it feels like no one will never understand my problems im also deeply insecure about my own physical appearance or to put it more accurately how people react to it i get a strong sense of disgust every time i gaze upon my own reflection in the mirror its a topic that has caused me a great amount of self hatred i hate my appearance a casual glance at a site like snapchat or instagram shows how attractive men and women get adoration reverence and praise from just merely existing and me ive never been complimented on my appearance by a woman in my entire life it causes me to feel disgusting about myself like ill never be viewed as attractive it makes me feel ontologically inferior to them in some way or that reality is just playing a sick joke upon us all i cant help but feel a disgusted mix of sadness envy and repressed anger towards the world it all feels so random so meaningless ive dwelt on it to the point of being cynical about whether love truly exists theyll say that no one deserves love which only makes me hate myself anymore my social skills are non existent i never learned how to communicate with others impress women etc and the suggested help ive seen online from armchair commentators is even worse alone having trouble with the girls friends in general theyll urge you to go after the hollowest meaningless and hedonistic things in existence i see it now someone in the comments is ready to recommend visiting a strip club hiring a prostitute or watching pornography on your computer its absolutely ridiculous they just want you to shut up keep repeating crap about how the world will ultimately work out for you and wait for you to disappear from the face of it i still dont know how people easily obtain friendships etc the notion of someone other than family particularly caring about me honestly seems totally surreal like a dream youd come up to relieve yourself of sadness then cry as you realize that it is nothing more than such i just want someone to cuddle up next me i want to be loved i want friends and all of this seems forever out of my reach im also a kissless virgin who has never been in a relationship but im not necessarily depressed about it for the reasons that might be typical among my peers its less about the sex than the idea of a women finding me desirable important to her and i feel like the world is implicitly telling me that im too ugly insecure and meaningless to be loved im not unintelligent from an academic book knowledge mperspective i turned my grades around once i got motivated in college im currently riding with a gpa as a sophomore but it feels like elite schools like harvard yale etc are now impossible for me to reach regardless of my efforts any chance of that perished with my miserable years in high school my cc allows me to transfer to a top public university in our state but the whole notion still kind of stings me yeah cry me a river and all of that i always wanted to make music as a dream career i can create epic songs in my head etc i want to good at syntheizers think synthwave but i dont know if ill have the time now to ever become close to perficient ivd barely picked up an instrument before now so i dont even really know where to begin im uncertain what my career path in life will be after college im still taking prereqs now i felt forced to go to college by my parents still dont have a job still dont have a drivers license i dont even know if there is a good place for me to start off at i feel undesired unwanted and abandoned in a world that is either vindictive or uncaring about my entire existence being white male autistic socially awkward and a virgin all together at once carries a lot of negative connotations in modern day society so im afraid of what people would wrongly presume about me if i told anyone this in real life that im sexist dangerous etc i feel like the gap will make me inevitably disconnected from my peers i have no idea what a year old is supposed to have done by now do most people have friends do they go to parties im utterly disconnected from experiences that all of my peers have already done a lot of things that you are supposed to do as a teenager i utterly missed i just sat cried and got bored in my room every day how the freakin heck are you supposed to fix this in a relatively short period of time ill graduate in years it feels like ive missed the boat entirely ive never really had any close relations with my peers ever can you even fix your past im constantly overcome with the feeling of being unwanted and alone that my chance of accel at my goals is now past and that i should just lay over rot and die maybe ill survive maybe ill get a decent job but id just be a wageslaving for the next years all alone i just want to do something substantive in my life to experience the world to accomplish things to be the most moral and outstanding person i can be but i just fear that all of this has already passed am i wrong any tips any recommendations i feel like the days are going by and im doing nothing with them feel free to ask me anything about this ill respond relatively quickly im afraid of dying a cynical bitter man who wasted their entire life im already th of my way through my th year of life and i have no idea how to talk to people my childhood and adolescence is pretty much completely over and i learned nothing from it if im and things dont get better im tempted to find a legal way to kill myself somewhere i cant live like this ,disgust,anger,fear,"[0.7688100934028625, 0.0908840149641037, 0.07602763175964355]"

come back obviously idk what her love life will be like amp i know i sound like a controlling amp paranoid bf but im wondering if i should move on to another girl amp hope we can be back together once i return months is so fucking long i dont want to lose what i have because my happiness has never been this high before i dont want to live in the past thats why i moved far away to college being with a girl who will wake up early in the morning to drive through a blizzard just to buy you cough medicine is something i truly cherish because ive never met one whod do that i asked her why she did it she says i care about you more than you care about your health was i in a dream theres actually someone who loves me like this this is so rare that i dont want to leave her once i broke the news to her she starting bawling her eyes like a faucet telling me that she wont ever find a guy like me again and ill never find a girl as good as her i dont know it now but my depression is going to hit me like a bus within a week i feel like my identity amp life have truly been revoked to be honest ive never felt such a genuine connection with any girl in my life last night i was with her and we partied our asses off we got hammered and it was just her and i on the dance floor the whole bar of people were watching us dance like aarp members she looked me in the eyes and drunkly said any girl would be lucky to have you babe dont fucking forget me okay i dont want you to leave because i still really love you then she started crying again i cant believe i have to leave the very people who care for me the most lifes too good for this to change i can really be myself for once finally i had just gotten to know her other nepali friends wed go partying and cook dinner together they enjoy my company amp treat me like family being around people who actually give a shit about you is something that i hardly experienced in the past i always had to act a certain way to make friends but these people make me feel human for once i make them laugh amp they pull a few pranks on me too for once in my life i have finally reached a state of happiness that has been gone for so unbelievably long seeing her smile when i wake up in the morning gives me reason to enjoy life again i dont want to drive away from my new life i love my school campus pride and friends i dont want to be a forgotten memory to them being with her and spending time with her friends makes me feel alive now i have to leave it all behind without getting to truly bond and make more memories with them in h s i was

232,depression,2020-02-03,how i m turned my life upside down long hey guys not sure if this is the right sub but ive been eating myself alive and just need to get this off my plate i guess it starts back in when i met my now ex f today girlfriend we were perfect for eachother we shared the same hobbies music tastes world views etc we had a great relationship for the most part eventually her depression and anxiety started acting up more and more this led to little to no intimate encounters between us for quite some time i was patient because i knew she was struggling but i also craved affection and intimacy this was one of our big problems she didnt have the confidence to initiate anything physical so i was always the one starting things unsure of whether she was even interested or not eventually this took a toll on my self esteem and i wondered if i was good enough or if i was the wrong type of guy etc this was happening after about years for a time referance looking back i couldve been more secure about the whole thing but i was younger and less secure myself my exs mental health kept getting worse and worse until the doctors figured she may have bi polar she tried a ton of different meds and nothing was working some things made it worse actually she started self harming again and began drinking copious amounts of vodka thats when the alcohol started she lived with her parents and would down a of vodka in her room by herself she would go through at least a couple per week thats a lot of alcohol for a  lb body to handle naturally this took a huge mental toll on me why wasnt i good enough to stop this from happening i tried my hardest to make her happy and comfortable it never felt like it worked and i always beat myself up for it this continued for a few more years eventually the doctors thought maybe she has bpd and not bipolar the guessing game and the changing medicine changes continued throughout all of this i felt so focused on her problems rather than the stress and my needing to be loved that eventually i lost the spark i wasnt getting the affection and love i so desperately craved i know its selfish because she was going through so much but you have to imagine how that effected me to watch the woman i love crash and burn and turn into an empty vessel that brings us to around christmas time year ago from now she had a little too much to drink one night even though i tried telling her not to drink at all and she basicly had a psychotic episode she was crying running away trying to walk around the city alone at night almost getting picked up by some random dude until my brother found her i started talking to her trying to find out what was going on through the mumbles and crying i found out she thought i was upset with her and then she told me a secret from when she was a kid that i had never heard in our years together she said there was some dark history between her babysitter and herself this was huge to me obviously i was upset and wished i could find this guy i just comforted her and we went to bed it hurt to not know about this after being together for so long but i understand that would be a hard topic to bring up a few months before that christmas season i had taken a liking to a coworker f at the time she was very kind outgoing and loving person basicly everything i didnt have at the time and was desperate for i started having feelings for her and i knew it was wrong so i avoided her at all costs and hoped that stupid crush would fade i just wanted to see my ex get better but after years of this i was exhausted and broken down eventually i decided i couldnt be with my ex anymore i wanted it to work but it wasnt going anywhere and i have to worry about myself too plus it wasnt fair to be emotionally cheating so i ended the relationship around january  i then perused my coworker almost immediately in hindsight this wasnt a good idea at all because i had plenty of healing to do whether i knew it or not so me and the co worker end up together not even a week later and things seem fine a little different guilty and weird but fine in april i got an email from an old employer offering me a job about hours drive from my hometown i decided to take the job and my new girlfriend decided she would move with me we are in love and it was a very bold move on her part to move to a new area with me after being together only months things are going pretty good over the summer but theres a few days where i really start to wonder what the hell ive done to my life i start to miss my ex and feel awful for abandoning her i look back at how fast i moved from an year relationship into a new one and it scares me me and my new girlfriend and great together but it still scares me the thoughts get more and more frequent until the point im almost sending my ex an apology text not in hopes of trying to rekindle our relationship just to genuinely apologize and tell her i feel like shit and she didnt deserve to be abandoned etc then the dreams start i have dreams of my ex a few times per week and it always ruins my day after i feel like i have un healed trauma and i dont know what to do to make matters worse i can tell my family gets along with my new gf much better than my old one she is already close with my mother i feel like the bad guy in this situation so im not looking for sympathy i just had to let this all out its not the most organized post but i hope someone can read this and give me some advice thanks a lot for taking the time to read this far tl dr

objectively all is good and well i eat well have plenty of friends and hobbies live communally with wonderful people and have a relatively comfortable academic research job in well being and sustainability ironically im currently on holiday for weeks running up mountains ffs so here is my dilemma having been so close to taking my own life and knowing that im still quite indifferent about my future i think theres a significant chance that i will end up seriously trying to end my life again in the future and so ive pretty much closed myself off to romance and am perhaps a little guarded more broadly despite craving intimacy deeply because it seems unfair to bring anyone else into that situation and that sucks for me too honestly i dont know how this will change how could i ever be sure that i wont end up that seriously suicidal again and if thats true how can i ever commit to someone as fully as they would like yet closing myself off this way means im missing out on some of lifes more meaningful experiences which of course leaves me more likely to sink very deeply into depression again it seems an insolvable dilemma unless of course a find someone with almost the same history and outlook as me such that we understood each other well enough to let whatever happens happen without shouldering the blame can anyone else relate im afraid i cant think of a more specific question tl dr for people that have seriously attempted suicide before can you be totally sure you wont go to that place again and if not how can you fully commit to relationships particularly of the

271,depression,2020-02-18, m i needed to get some things off my chest tl dr dumb man in his mid s destroys his own life comes to reddit to complain amp x b hi im not used to write anything on social media much less things related to depression so im not sure if this will fit here as it may be a long post with some background to clear things up from the begginning this is my main account im spanish mentioning this because as things here in europe particularly economically wise are different they may have been a contributing factor to my depression maybe even if there are similarities mine could be very similar and yet very different than yours if you live in the usa or any other country aaaand this is me https imgur com a s mvwfa https imgur com a s mvwfa i wanted to share this to address something you all already know guess what yep thats my instagram profile photo notice the smile everything in that photo is staged i hadnt slept at all for two days did not want to smile and i took nearly photos until i got one which made me look less shitty ive already had several people telling me that my eyes scream sadness other than that ive recently started noticing the area directly under the eyelids to be darker and darker anyway i dont want this post to be read like a teen vampire romance book so ill try to be pragmatic my problem started when i was following my first breakup summer between my third and fourth hs year youd think that id be stuck thinking about my ex gf for more than a decade but no as even though i really loved her that issue would eventually stop hurting however i dont know if by that age i was already starting to develop depression as i was in hs which means i got to be around friends maybe look for other girls which i eventually did etc still i remember that by my fourth year of hs i had started to skip classes by the end of said fourth year i had a total sum of a full month of absences hours a day hours worth of learning lost it wasnt like i was skipping classes to go party i just slept or waited for hours alone sitting down thinking to clarify my parents are not the problem theyre along with our dog the best thing that could ever happen to me so it was even worse when i started coming home with worse and worse grades i went from being one of the three best students in our class to the guy who girls ask hey didnt you like drop from school my friend list was getting emptier and emptier by the months but i somehow managed to get to college spoiler it ended up badly people were not a problem but me doing nothing for the whole year or sitting in class for hour and then leaving to go hide at home when thoughts started coming to mind and couldnt manage the anxiety and sadness definitely were i couldnt take it anymore so i talked to my dad and told him that i wanted to go back home and work get my own money and pay for my shit this was back when i was if im not mistaken i was mad at myself for wasting my parents money and after several tries i managed to convince them and here is when things get fun i mentioned europe economy situation and here is when it comes into play nobody wants to hire me nobody needs anyone

dissertation lol im sorry i never talk about my own things i guess i had to vent a little thanks for reading d please excuse any mistakes ive tried to write properly but im honestly too tired to do another check,post,male, m i needed to get some things off my chest tl dr dumb man in his mid s destroys his own life comes to reddit to complain amp x b hi im not used to write anything on social media much less things related to depression so im not sure if this will fit here as it may be a long post with some background to clear things up from the begginning this is my main account im spanish mentioning this because as things here in europe particularly economically wise are different they may have been a contributing factor to my depression maybe even if there are similarities mine could be very similar and yet very different than yours if you live in the usa or any other country aaaand this is me https imgur com a s mvwfa https imgur com a s mvwfa i wanted to share this to address something you all already know guess what yep thats my instagram profile photo notice the smile everything in that photo is staged i hadnt slept at all for two days did not want to smile and i took nearly photos until i got one which made me look less shitty ive already had several people telling me that my eyes scream sadness other than that ive recently started noticing the area directly under the eyelids to be darker and darker anyway i dont want this post to be read like a teen vampire romance book so ill try to be pragmatic my problem started when i was following my first breakup summer between my third and fourth hs year youd think that id be stuck thinking about my ex gf for more than a decade but no as even though i really loved her that issue would eventually stop hurting however i dont know if by that age i was already starting to develop depression as i was in hs which means i got to be around friends maybe look for other girls which i eventually did etc still i remember that by my fourth year of hs i had started to skip classes by the end of said fourth year i had a total sum of a full month of absences hours a day hours worth of learning lost it wasnt like i was skipping classes to go party i just slept or waited for hours alone sitting down thinking to clarify my parents are not the problem theyre along with our dog the best thing that could ever happen to me so it was even worse when i started coming home with worse and worse grades i went from being one of the three best students in our class to the guy who girls ask hey didnt you like drop from school my friend list was getting emptier and emptier by the months but i somehow managed to get to college spoiler it ended up badly people were not a problem but me doing nothing for the whole year or sitting in class for hour and then leaving to go hide at home when thoughts started coming to mind and couldnt manage the anxiety and sadness definitely were i couldnt take it anymore so i talked to my dad and told him that i wanted to go back home and work get my own money and pay for my shit this was back when i was if im not mistaken i was mad at myself for wasting my parents money and after several tries i managed to convince them and here is when things get fun i mentioned europe economy situation and here is when it comes into play nobody wants to hire me nobody needs anyone

286,depression,2020-02-24,i m feel empty and lonely even though i have friends and gf ive been in rl for about years i could say im outgoing every weekend i would go out to a party know a lot of people talk to them occasionally i have my regular spot where i hang out and know everyone from the owner to bartenders and frequent guests every once in a two weeks or so i would catch up with my best friend we would hang out and talk about deep topics i would say i have good relationship with my goth big tittdy gf we see each other every second day or so our sex life is awesome we really enjoy spending time together but i feel unaccomplished and stuck the main reason is that i got this corpo job which pays alright and can be dull without big intensity but it gives me to be independent and in the same time it ties me down where i dont have mental power to start something on my own or even go to the gym i see it as i dont have time for it even tough i have plenty time job and min commute should give me a lot of time to explore new things right ive tried for months or so to hit the gym with my gf but when i became overwhelmed with job and she had to travel i dropped out thinking to get back again occasionally i would have this clingy moment where i really question is everything normal i would be mad or more precisely said disappointed that i dont interact with my gf or share some stupid memes feel isolated and alone without anyone around me i try to think of a way to burn this feeling with fire or to find something that fulfills me and motivates me i would like to find more mental energy for ideas that i have i get motivated with some ideas like build some gadgets where i ordered half of parts already try to continue with my online store which has some orders but i just lose the will im currently living day by day without plans for the future and that causes overwhelming anxiety in me since i think im average loser without anything accomplished in my life is this some kind of depression or apathy deep down im struggling with this emptiness even tough if you look from the outside you would say i got my shit together and everything is fine how to find some supporting community and snap out of it i see how it is ruining my life and relationship because i cant keep my frame as a stable well round male that can maintain good relationships i would

290,depression,2020-02-25,any advice any fuck making a throwaway ill just write my thoughts and see what happens m mandatory community service im doing it at a library i believe it was the only place left in my hometown right now to do it so in a lot of ways i could say im lucky didnt have to move anywhere didnt have to even change my gym membership or anything but the library is destroying my fucking head its me either doing overly easy tasks that have gotten pretty goddamn boring after months of being there or its me having nothing to do because it often feels like they dont really even need me but i still cant fill this time with something else like being on my phone or reading books or whatever because the staff still wants me to do something even if theres nothing to do you know the kind of people that just make no goddamn sense like how dare you just wait for more work do that thing again then even if theres no need to i tried talking about this immediately with family etc but theyre just ignoring it first they gave a pretty good point saying that it takes a couple weeks to a month for something to become a routine so just keep going but now its been months of just endless slow boring mind numbingly fucking frustrating days and im so tired of it and of course now when i try talking about it its just ignored its that instant stop complaining thing i read how its about attitude often and doing it just to be able to enjoy other things but this library is in my fucking way constantly cant relax and enjoy movies music shows or games because the librarys in my head constantly if the two months had gone fast more wouldnt sound so bad but theyve been so slow sooooooo slow more sounds awful hitting a wall or screaming doesnt help the only thing so far relieving some of the anger is hitting myself in the head and slapping myself hard thats the only thing that lets some pressure and frustration out hitting objects doesnt help because its me trying to find an alternative to real pain and violence and those things are in my mind a lot at the moment over a year ago a childhood friend of mine killed himself because of bad depression and ignorant people around him just ignoring his dreams and not being supportive in any way or helping with his mental health he was always a super ambitious and smart person im not suicidal at the moment but the

hours days a week i dont have any friends i used to but as i get older the depression gets worse my self esteem is wrecked i have incredible social anxiety thats also gotten worse as i get older the

love them too they are everything i wanted in my family as a kid i regularly see a therapist and a psychologist and am on medication two things have triggered my downward spiral the loss of a written prescription of my antidepressants which has caused me to be off them for about a month but i have since found and been back on them but only for about days and this is also my fault and im kicking myself for this and the severing of my relationship with my mother she had me young and we have had a super insane relationship with no boundaries at all whatsoever she is my absolute best friend in the whole world but also the cause of my depression and anxiety regularly verbally and emotionally manipulating and abusing me since i hit puberty because of all of this i am incredibly depressed and anxious and its getting worse with each passing day something new happens with my mother almost every day where she has been cold to me but on top of this i have been physically sick with the flu

love them too they are everything i wanted in my family as a kid i regularly see a therapist and a psychologist and am on medication two things have triggered my downward spiral the loss of a written prescription of my antidepressants which has caused me to be off them for about a month but i have since found and been back on them but only for about days and this is also my fault and im kicking myself for this and the severing of my relationship with my mother she had me young and we have had a super insane relationship with no boundaries at all whatsoever she is my absolute best friend in the whole world but also the cause of my depression and anxiety regularly verbally and emotionally manipulating and abusing me since i hit puberty because of all of this i am incredibly depressed and anxious and its getting worse with each passing day something new happens with my mother almost every day where she has been cold to me but on top of this i have been physically sick with the flu which is going around in my area amp it has caused me to miss my class last week it is days a week for hours but i am able to work at home because we use our laptops to run the program we work on so i have been keeping up with schoolwork last friday was our midway presentation on our final projects i graduate this may and i ended up having a full on panic attack because i didnt have enough money to print my presentation out on my university account and i left my wallet at home because my boyfriend drove me to school it was already past time the class had started so i ran outside to try to calm down but everything had built up and i couldnt stop crying needless to say i didnt go to class i emailed my professor an embarrassingly cringey email about what happened and he hasnt responded attendance is important in this class this past weekend was mardi gras which i did not participate in because it turns out i have a sinus infection right after getting the flu i have a dr note for this i relapsed on my antibiotics and had to go back today to get a stronger prescription mardi gras classes resumed today at  my class starts at  i got a drs note because i obviously still feel bad coughing up mucus sneezing constantly blowing my gross snotty nose every seconds deep mucusy cough every seconds its not pretty and the class is freaking hours long and i dont want to subject anyone else to that either the classroom is tiny so i sent him it i said i can present when i come back this friday he has yet to respond to that too im terrified im going to fail and not graduate i have to graduate because i have an amazing job lined up for me afterwards tldr it feels like bad thing after bad thing keeps happening to me and i really want to just give up but i have so much pressure to

302,depression,2020-02-27,not even sad anymore just feel nothing always ive m come to an odd place in my depression that kinda has made it worse for me throughout my life ive aways been somewhat hyper aware of my own emotional state as my emotions have always been something which ive felt incredibly intensely when i was younger  i was very lonely and had a hard time connecting with others this grew into something i came to recognized as situation depression i had always believed i would feel truly better if i made those important social connections in my life eventually i did i found myself in a strong circle of friends working towards my life goals and in love for the first time in my life with an amazing girl this truly made me content my depression went away and for the first time in my adult life i knew what it was like to be happy and proud of myself this lasted about years  and made me believe that it was possible to live a happy life slowly and one by one i began to lose the things that were important to me my family moved across the country while i was in school and our relationships soured my girlfriend moved away we tried long distance but it wasnt what she wanted she ghosting me and started a new life my best friends slowly started to move away change for the worse lots of drugs and alcohol involved or leave one of my best friends passed away and i started to fail out of school all of this put me into the darkest hole ive ever been in and to be honest im not sure if ive ever fully recovered  i can remember the most intense and excruciating sadness of my life physically it felt like this vast aching hollowness inside of my chest and stomach that would never ever go away like the deepest blackest pit i could imagine had replaced the spot where my heart used to be amp x b over the next two years  things began to turn around and my life improved i turned my grades around after about horrible wasted semesters i started a new relationship met some new people who became my friends and i started working again after a long break but truthfully i never felt content the way i used to and im still not the same i dont truly connect with friends anymore and feel distant to everyone around me ive now graduated from school finally with my ba after years and moved back to my hometown i dont keep in touch with my newer friends and only really talk to my girlfriend who ive been with for years now were doing long distance now and its hard sometimes i honestly dont feel the capacity to love someone anymore and it puts an incredibly heavy strain on my relationship with her i feel she deserves better than that and she always have but the truth is i dont feel anything anymore its just blank numbness every single day and night of my life im trying to get past it im trying to better and love what i still have and what ive made for myself but i still feel so utterly empty and void of emotion its almost like thats the best emotionally i can do for myself and ive just come to except it im about to turn now im looking for full time jobs staying active with exercise i am sober since the new year and trying my best in my relationship but still feel

women ive liked rejected me or ignored me the only time women liked me they were morbidly obese and extremely unattractive but then i would be told to give them a chance thats your league anyways at least theyre nice girls being told to take an l with a smile isnt a great life especially if you compare her to the women who rejected me their husbands and boyfriends who i loathe see that im with a woman much less unattractive after being rejected by them gives them a whole lot of leverage over me and thats absolutely humiliating for me like haha my girl rejected you and youre stuck with an ugly woman sucks to suck loser that is humiliation defined and everybody wants me to embrace this happening and its not fair ill be happy when a woman hotter than the women who rejected me loves me until then all i ever got was fucked over no lube or spit and then people tell me be happy for the people i hate to just lie down and take it and thats fucking bullshit,disgust,anger,anticipation,"[0.3432869613170624, 0.31469327211380005, 0.15426552295684814]"

doing support i have extremely mixed feelings about it this is not only due to support kinda sucking but also the business aspects that are unrewarding to me all i really know about me is what i wrote below i have no fucking clue which job title i am meant to pick based on this info i grew up with an aptitude for computers very early on i would just screw around with them reinstall the os and learn the hardware i probably understood this by age or or so dont know exactly i never became much of a programmer i know the basics of python and java android but while i enjoyed the projects at the time i didnt go on spending my time on loads of programming projects and stuff i just started a course on ios development which i like but i am not hyperfocused on it i do like it tho but i need a little push i am very good with hardware overclocking etc i learn concepts that interest me very quickly i have done every out of the box thing out there i have done hackintosh but also much more out there kind of stuff i fucked around with software defined radio just first thing that jumped in my head i successfully on first attempt delided a ps cpu and gpu with a scalpel but the list is endless just little projects i get super interested in and then poof completed it so no more interest i am good mechanically i can fix almost all things on bicycles and probably some simple stuff on cars fix loads of shit around the house i can solder and do simple repairs on electronics spent quite a bit of time on rc cars and other rc stuff and can do all of it all self taught i love doing shit like this i have a bachelor degree but dont give a fuck about it i never really enjoyed studying i was mostly interested in my little side projects i would come up with rather than study also love cars and love

318,depression,2020-03-02,i m am starting to feel depressed again after years on mobile sorry for long post and bad formatting the past few weeks have been shit context i was bullied in primary school by people who used to be my friends i was depressed and often thought about suicide once the bullying stopped in year  years ago and i went to highschool i thought that i had overcome my depression as i was happier and wasnt having anymore suicidal thoughts although i had severe social anxiety i have not been a christian since year because of the bullying and had been struggling with that until a few months ago when i was finally able to admit it to my parents my parents are christian and have been together since they were in highschool my dad had cancer when i was and has chronic back pain as a result and has been basically an absent father my entire life as when he isnt working he is on his phone or sleeping my mum is the mission leader for our church last month i went on a mission trip with my mum and brother to indonesia and someone from indonesia came with us to bali for a holiday at the end of the trip before we returned home i went on the trip because my mum had said to everyone at church that i was going before i had told her whether or not i wanted to go and didnt want to embarrass her by not going even though i didnt want to the person who had come with us has been in contact with my mum for years and they constantly talk to each other and there is an age difference of years what happened when we came back from the mission trip my mum said that my dad and her were getting a divorce because of some of the things my dad has done and she has been silently dealing with the fact that she doesnt love my dad anymore she says she has been dealing with this for the last year and that she finally came to terms with having to get a divorce we found out the same day as our dad the next day i went to a friends place and that night i got the most drunk i have ever gotten and hated myself for it my dad kept coming over and actually started to make an effort in being a part of our lives while also subtlety hinting that part of the reason they were getting divorced was our fault without realizing he was doing it after a week of processing the divorce i found out that my mum had actually slept with the person who came with us for the holiday and that they want to pursue a relationship together i found out this from my dad who had to actively ask what happened and why the apparent suddenness of it all today my dad vented and yelled at us and i had a minor panic attack and realised that i am starting to feel depressed again before all this i was really excited to start going to a university that is much closer than the one i went to last year and has a much better course reputation and employability after graduating from there now im finding it difficult to have the effort to do anything let alone go to university i want to go to a therapist but am

321,depression,2020-03-04,i m feel like im reaching a breaking point ive been feeling depressed af the last few months it sort of feels like a relapse after about months of a reasonably healthy mental state basically i feel physically drained of energy all day i have zero motivation to study or try in any way whatsoever in college im doing a notoriously tough course and barely passed my christmas exams i come home exhausted but when i go to bed i just become really agitated and irritated my heart starts pounding and i struggle to breathe i cant get comfortable and even if go to bed exhausted at pm i wouldnt get to sleep until am however in the mornings i struggle so much to get out of bed i feel like theres almost zero point getting up anyway as i wouldnt even miss out on anything i end up missing so many of my lectures simply becuase i cannot bring myself to get out of bed i still live at home going to college but if i lived by myself without parents i could see myself just staying in bed my room for days at a time every day passes by in a sort of blur for me i feel like i almost have a depersonalization disorder as i just operate in autopilot i feel like a shell its almost like im just empty inside i dont feel emotions everything just feels monotonous and numb honestly i really just dont give a fuck about anything anymore i used to have passions like playing music sport reading films etc but nothing excites me anymore i feel like i dont really have an emotional outlet its like im just existing day to day without actually living since i find close to zero pleasure in general life i self medicate with weed i guess its just a coping mechanism in order to feel something other than numb i also think i have memory loss as the last couple months have really blurred i honestly dont know where the time has gone or what ive been doing in that time i also have really really bad eating habits i dont generally eat breakfast and then could go the day without eating however when i come home i often would binge until i struggle to breathe i also feel socially exhausted every day i have to go into college pretending to be someone im not is mentally draining as i feel like im putting on a fake persona just to mask the numbness when all i wanna do is just go to bed get high this is probably part of the reason i avoid going to lectures this all eventually caused me to go to the student couseling services in my college sometime last week however i feel like i wasnt as honest as i should have been regarding my situation i was definitely making it out to be less severe than it actually is they set me up with counselling sessions that start in weeks however i feel like my ability to function has been severely impaired in the last few days tonight i felt the urge to self harm for the first time and honestly if i had clean razors i would already have done so i dont think i can wait weeks for my counselling appointment i feel like i should go to a gp psychiatrist and see what they think i feel like i just want someone to tell me exactly what i have im sure its depression and perhaps symptomatic insomnia a binge eating disorder i guess part of me still denies its depression despite me knowing that it almost certainly is and i feel like i need a medical professional to tell me how it is in order for me to be able to work on getting better i guess i also want to see if they think that medication could help too ultimately i just want treatment as soon as possible something concrete i can show to myself to tell me that im taking steps to improve myself as atm i feel so lost in life and i feel like a breakingpoint might come soon unless i change things i really dont know where to go from here i guess this post is just a reflection

and i feel so so empty those all happened in chronological order while my past friends have all moved on in their lives through university or work theyve made new friends met new people and found some sort of a happy place in their lives as a solopreneur who doesnt go to university or work in a traditional environment i havent gained these friendships as a result all my friends have moved on and im left being that guy asking everyone to outings when everyone is busy with their new friendships ive always been the type of person to delve in the past and think about all the good times that happened this is why im always trying so hard to bring those good times back that apparently no one else wants this was the beginning of my downwards spiral so to say and leads to what happened next being the super sentimental is that the right word person that i am i really wanted to rekindle the past relationships i had and not lose touch i have connected with several friends that i had previously lost touch with but i also decided to reach out to an ex as you might have see from the title yes i do have girlfriend at the moment however for some unknown reason to me i really really want to reconnect with this ex girlfriend and form a friendship i thought that i had a lot in common with her and that we connected very well this sort of connection might be something that i feel i lacking in my current relationship but after reaching out i received no reply i have no idea if she read my message or if shes changed her number or what while i do see her around every once in a while its such a rare occurrence and its always from afar plus im pretty shy so its hard to muster up the courage to speak to her if i see her unexpectedly this happening in addition to how i feel about losing all my friends its killing me i feel like im in a hole that i cant get out of i try to bury myself in more work starting new activities and exercising more i still feel like absolute shit my assumption was

that i wouldnt be able to reach her reddit what do i do where did it all go wrong plus would it be wrong for me to send a follow up message to my ex again or through a different medium i used already

help my friends we are all supposed to be best mates we are supposed to care about eachother but i cant help but feel like i have been left in the dark they all say they are there for me they know my history but yet they seem to still ignore my feelings i dont think i have ever recieved a message asking how me or the family is going when i ask them all the time they know im still trying to find my real self again but they wont even help me in anyway we talk everyday and there would be times where i wouldnt reply or talk to them for days due to just feeling low amp they wouldnt even fucking message me to see if i was alright i have genuinely explained my situation mood swings being on edge amp angry at times for minor issues amp that i am seeking help to get me back on track but they will still have a go at me amp argue with me amp talk shit about me when they said they understood my situation sometimes i wish their dad would fucking die at so they could see what its fucking like im fucking confused how do i approach this i dont want to lose my friends but i cant keep taking this shit from them i dont want to bring it up with them because i dont fucking know how maybe i should just completely ignore them until one of them asks me finally or notices something is completely wrong so i can let them know everything sorry if i cant type properly i just cant think straight thanks

381,depression,2020-04-02,i f need advice on how to help my boyfriend m get through his depression i myself am a sufferer of mental health issues though i feel as though i cope as best i can i remind myself of how lucky i am whilst also not dismissing how i feel i take necessary days off to in the long term aid my mental health i have routines and resources to look forward to i also have outlets to vent to in times of despair ive dealt with depression long enough to over come it for the most part whilst still suffering my brother attempted suicide when i was and from that point onwards it was the beginning of my mental health issues though going through that i know suicide is an option i will never consider whilst even feeling suicidal the lasting damage is too painful on those you love and ive learned how precious life is through this in conclusion ive come to terms with my depression being apart of me and ive tried my best to adapt im glad im growing up in a period of time where mental health for the most part is normalised if not i dont think i would cope as well as i do though my boyfriend on the other hand struggles to see the light and struggles to get through the day with his underlying depressive thoughts these depressive thoughts have become darker he doesnt put the pressure of suicide on our relationship though he has made it clear he has suicidal thoughts and finds it hard to see past these thoughts with everything going on right now and for him to not have his usual resources of happiness that help him through the day he is getting worse also me not being there in person to comfort him is hurting him a lot i feel myself getting overwhelmed by everything also but im still coping and believe this is temporary and it will all be okay if i didnt think this way i also would be cracking up alike him but he cant seem to take on this it will be okay mindset which is important right now but it would be ignorant of me to get annoyed that he doesnt think this way because thats an element of depression which he has negative thoughts and feelings of despair i have voiced that i think he needs professional help as have his friends he got the courage to openly discuss his mental health to his friends and have they also in return hes aware it isnt fair to put this stress over us by opening up about how he feels regarding his suicidal thoughts though he cant come to terms with getting to the point of talking to his parents that would be the first step in getting towards professional help i cant help put feel overwhelmed when the topic comes up i dont know how to react im not a professional my advice to him is to realise how he currently feels is only temporary and that i myself go through bouts of depression i get out of them im okay for a while i fall back he has never experienced depression up until years ago i have experienced depression for the past years hence my reasoning for my development of coping mechanisms he cant come to terms with why he isnt like his old self why he isnt happy all the time we all have our breaking point i believe when childhood happiness just fades though he often thinks back to when he didnt feel this way but i dont know how to help that with my experiences and relatability to how he feels in ways still doesnt help i never turn things on myself i simply resonate im aware of how annoying it is when your upset and someone ignorantly makes it about them i give advice as to how i deal how i think he should approach things that will help him but i cant help him i dont know how to help him but all i want to do is to help and be there i believe he is only going to get worse as this goes on and i dont know where else to go for advice i myself will probably only worsen too i feel we all will but how do we keep

depressed dealing with different doctors everyday my daughters developmentally delayed with a seizure disorder so it was a little more difficult for her to fight off this common viral pneumonia kids her age tend to get ive been in the hospital since march nd with our daughter who turned on the march st everything was going okay so far her dad was coming over every night after work and being all the great things bc otherwise id be pissed at him for not being here for us weve had this fight one too many times but he stepped it up this time i told him i was so happy and proud that we were doing okay and he was here for us but then covid hit us and suddenly shit got really real for us they kicked out my mom one week and limited to visitors to only mom and dad at bedside a week later dad got kicked out now its only me allowed at bedside its been super rough going through all of this alone to say the least then things really started to get emotionally draining for me her dad started being irresponsible pulling rent money from our savings to buy weed smoking way too much spending long amounts of hours on the game he stopped texting me back i would get upset because i needed him here for me still and wanted to talk to him i dont have anyone to talk to hes supposed to be my person we fought over that for a few days i didnt talk to him for two days his facebook was logged in on his laptop that was left here for me to watch tv on i got curious he was liking this one girls post at in the morning more on that later he also unblocked one of his exes apparently he felt compelled to check up on them and see how theyre doing at am instead of thinking about us and checking to see how were doing over here which really sucked i questioned him i asked him why he unblocked her he just was curious and wanted to see how shes doing apparently the girl who cheated on him with her best friend i questioned him about the other girl the one that he was liking her post he said he had no idea who she was and it just popped up on his timeline we eventually sort of get over our fighting but i wasnt over it honestly i was just tired of fighting tired of having to dumb things down for him and explain why his behavior is inappropriate and why it was hurtful for him to be a certain ways towards me regardless of how irritated he is things seemed kind of steady and okay hes texting me often calling me once hes out of work bringing me food everyday again all the great things telling me how he cant wait for us to be home so he can hold us and his arms all the great things he shouldve been doing all along then i find out that hes been messaging the one girl that he denied knowing through snapchat hes been consistently talking to her he met her through his coworker he lied to me about knowing her he was planning to meet up with her tomorrow to hang out and smoke after telling him all of this and i knew the truth about it all he admitted it to me finally he didnt really seem apologetic didnt apologize kept saying he doesnt know what to say or how to fix it he also said that hes not displaying any sympathy because hes half awake and super sleepy i feel so shitty ive been crying non stop i wanted to stay with him despite all of this to work this out for the sake of our daughter he says he wants us to be a family and wont talk to her anymore but i dont trust him im already going crazy thinking about what hes going to do tomorrow and if hes going to lie to me and still hang out with her its already over hopefully well be getting discharged within the next week or so and i have no idea where were going to go i dont want to go home to our apartment thats not a home anymore my daughter is special needs and i havent been able to work after graduating school

depressed dealing with different doctors everyday my daughters developmentally delayed with a seizure disorder so it was a little more difficult for her to fight off this common viral pneumonia kids her age tend to get ive been in the hospital since march nd with our daughter who turned on the march st everything was going okay so far her dad was coming over every night after work and being all the great things bc otherwise id be pissed at him for not being here for us weve had this fight one too many times but he stepped it up this time i told him i was so happy and proud that we were doing okay and he was here for us but then covid hit us and suddenly shit got really real for us they kicked out my mom one week and limited to visitors to only mom and dad at bedside a week later dad got kicked out now its only me allowed at bedside its been super rough going through all of this alone to say the least then things really started to get emotionally draining for me her dad started being irresponsible pulling rent money from our savings to buy weed smoking way too much spending long amounts of hours on the game he stopped texting me back i would get upset because i needed him here for me still and wanted to talk to him i dont have anyone to talk to hes supposed to be my person we fought over that for a few days i didnt talk to him for two days his facebook was logged in on his laptop that was left here for me to watch tv on i got curious he was liking this one girls post at in the morning more on that later he also unblocked one of his exes apparently he felt compelled to check up on them and see how theyre doing at am instead of thinking about us and checking to see how were doing over here which really sucked i questioned him i asked him why he unblocked her he just was curious and wanted to see how shes doing apparently the girl who cheated on him with her best friend i questioned him about the other girl the one that he was liking her post he said he had no idea who she was and it just popped up on his timeline we eventually sort of get over our fighting but i wasnt over it honestly i was just tired of fighting tired of having to dumb things down for him and explain why his behavior is inappropriate and why it was hurtful for him to be a certain ways towards me regardless of how irritated he is things seemed kind of steady and okay hes texting me often calling me once hes out of work bringing me food everyday again all the great things telling me how he cant wait for us to be home so he can hold us and his arms all the great things he shouldve been doing all along then i find out that hes been messaging the one girl that he denied knowing through snapchat hes been consistently talking to her he met her through his coworker he lied to me about knowing her he was planning to meet up with her tomorrow to hang out and smoke after telling him all of this and i knew the truth about it all he admitted it to me finally he didnt really seem apologetic didnt apologize kept saying he doesnt know what to say or how to fix it he also said that hes not displaying any sympathy because hes half awake and super sleepy i feel so shitty ive been

depressed never had a clue because i never let too much of it show although ive been pushed over my limit a few times recently when my problems first started it was entirely a loneliness thing and i think at the time getting into a decent relationship might have helped but as i said its grown into a much more general problem ive swung up and down a lot but recently the lows have gotten lower and lower a few months ago something pushed me to cut myself and i did it quite a bit for about a month thankfully i managed to lift myself out of that and overall my mood was improving due to some various things looking up for me however corona totally stalled all of that by closing off college since then ive started to plummet again things got bad enough that i decided i should get some help and i opened up slightly to my mom about my issues this is where i struggle i can barely talk to people about this stuff even just saying im depressed without going into the details is hard for me she still doesnt know how awful its gotten over the last few months because im incapable of telling her even when the opportunities show themselves because of this shes reacted to me like i dont have any real problems its just hormones etc you guys know the drill she did agree to try and help me talk to a therapist but her idea was kinda skewed as to what that would look like she thinks the therapist would explain to me what real problems are id see how miniscule my own are and then wed all be happy go lucky and id get over my stuff of course thats bs but i dont have the strength to tell her that

413,depression,2020-04-17,dealing with a depressed dad hi guys this is probably a rant but i dont know what else to do i am f and my dad m is depressed and emotionally unstable immature a couple years ago he revealed to us at home that he grew up in an abusive home his dad was an alcoholic and physically abusive possibly sexually abusive prior to telling us this he used to idolize his father in an almost obsessive way i am a girl but he named me after his father and gave me a male name as my middle name this childhood abuse makes sense because he has always been emotionally immature and irresponsible i am years old and i have never depended on my dad he is terrible with money and always in between jobs he also worked in many different countries when i was growing up and so we have never had such a close relationship my dad is a very traditional indian hindu he does not believe in going to a doctor for his depression but has attempted suicide multiple times instead he goes to gurus and yogis to help him and has an obsession with yoga i do not believe this helps him because he is still depressed and searching for meaning in life because of this he is obsessed with helping the poor this isnt a bad thing i know but he does it to the extent that he runs us into debt to give to others and steals things from our home to donate to others so he can feel good about himself while putting his own family through duress it has caused a huge rift in our family as my mother is the only person who provides for my siblings and i and he puts a financial strain on our lives with his desperate attempt to find purpose but i feel bad for him because i know he is a very sad person on the inside when my siblings and i started working he started asking us for money all the time so he could donate it or build yoga studios for his gurus i am not trying to offend anyone but i do believe some of these gurus are scam artists and some of these yoga groups are like cults i am not a religious person and i dont think any religion is beyond reproach i think he gets taken advantage of by these gurus who use him for his money his siblings also take advantage of him by constantly asking him for money many people take advantage of him for money and he gives it to them because he needs to feel fulfilled then he comes to us and takes our money because he has none as an aside after high school i was accepted to every college i applied to and one was my dream school to study aerospace engineering i was unable to go because my dad said he had no money a couple years later when one of my cousins wanted to study at her dream school he offered to sell some of his real estate to pay for her education as a donation so he could feel good about himself i have never forgiven him for this he goes out of his way to provide for others and does nothing for my siblings mom and i no one in my family can tell my dad anything about his terrible money habits because he gets depressed and threatens to kill himself so we just have to let him do him for all these years now that covid is happening were supposed to stay in our houses to avoid being sick my dad has recently had a surgery and is diabetic so he is at risk for covid my older sister is a covid doctor on the frontline treating patients and isolated at the hospital she has called and told my dad repeatedly to stay at home because things are bad he refuses to stay at home and goes out everyday to build his yoga studio and make donations he has taken my credit card and spent thousands on this studio and these donations in the past few weeks when i am currently out of a job due to covid and need to save my money as i am migrating to canada to start a new life soon this has been my breaking point so today i finally told him about his spending habits and the fact that none of his children feel like they can rely on him as a parent it was a bad fight and he has not been talking to me since and seems upset now i am worried he might do something to hurt himself or that i may have made him more depressed which wasnt my intention but i just lost it today after years of dealing with his behavior i have also dealt with an cocaine addicted cousin and i still feel like my fathers behavior has been more stressful to deal with i dont know what to do now so maybe someone can help me it is not my intention to cause pain to anyone but how do you balance this must i always let him take advantage of me because he is depressed i feel like his depression has ruined my life in many ways but i dont want him to kill himself over things i try to address in his behavior should i just let him do as he pleases and then maybe i can go to therapy to help deal with the stress he causes me rather than try to address it directly with him seeing as he is not emotionally mature enough to handle criticism someone please help me ,post,male,dealing with a depressed dad hi guys this is probably a rant but

413,depression,2020-04-17,dealing with a depressed dad hi guys this is probably a rant but i dont know what else to do i am f and my dad m is depressed and emotionally unstable immature a couple years ago he revealed to us at home that he grew up in an abusive home his dad was an alcoholic and physically abusive possibly sexually abusive prior to telling us this he used to idolize his father in an almost obsessive way i am a girl but he named me after his father and gave me a male name as my middle name this childhood abuse makes sense because he has always been emotionally immature and irresponsible i am years old and i have never depended on my dad he is terrible with money and always in between jobs he also worked in many different countries when i was growing up and so we have never had such a close relationship my dad is a very traditional indian hindu he does not believe in going to a doctor for his depression but has attempted suicide multiple times instead he goes to gurus and yogis to help him and has an obsession with yoga i do not believe this helps him because he is still depressed and searching for meaning in life because of this he is obsessed with helping the poor this isnt a bad thing i know but he does it to the extent that he runs us into debt to give to others and steals things from our home to donate to others so he can feel good about himself while putting his own family through duress it has caused a huge rift in our family as my mother is the only person who provides for my siblings and i and he puts a financial strain on our lives with his desperate attempt to find purpose but i feel bad for him because i know he is a very sad person on the inside when my siblings and i started working he started asking us for money all the time so he could donate it or build yoga studios for his gurus i am not trying to offend anyone but i do believe some of these gurus are scam artists and some of these yoga groups are like cults i am not a religious person and i dont think any religion is beyond reproach i think he gets taken advantage of by these gurus who use him for his money his siblings also take advantage of him by constantly asking him for money many people take advantage of him for money and he gives it to them because he needs to feel fulfilled then he comes to us and takes our money because he has none as an aside after high school i was accepted to every college i applied to and one was my dream school to study aerospace engineering i was unable to go because my dad said he had no money a couple years later when one of my cousins wanted to study at her dream school he offered to sell some of his real estate to pay for her education as a donation so he could feel good about himself i have never forgiven him for this he goes out of his way to provide for others and does nothing for my siblings mom and i no one in my family can tell my dad anything about his terrible money habits because he gets depressed and threatens to kill himself so we just have to let him do him for all these years now that covid is happening were supposed to stay in our houses to avoid being sick my dad has recently had a surgery and is diabetic so he is at risk for covid my older sister is a covid doctor on the frontline treating patients and isolated at the hospital she has called and told my dad repeatedly to stay at home because things are bad he refuses to stay at home and goes out everyday to build his yoga studio and make donations he has taken my credit card and spent thousands on this studio and these donations in the past few weeks when i am currently out of a job due to covid and need to save my money as i am migrating to canada to start a new life soon this has been my breaking point so today i finally told him about his spending habits and the fact that none of his children feel like they can rely on him as a parent it was a bad fight and he has not been talking to me since and seems upset now i am worried he might do something to hurt himself or that i may have made him more depressed which wasnt my intention but i just lost it today after years of dealing with his behavior i have also dealt with an cocaine addicted cousin and i still feel like my fathers behavior has been more stressful to deal with i dont know what to do now so maybe someone can help me it is not my intention to cause pain to anyone but how do you balance this must i always let him take advantage of me because he is depressed i feel like his depression has ruined my life in many ways but i dont want him to kill himself over things i try to address in his behavior should i just let him do as he pleases and then maybe i can go to therapy to help deal with the stress he causes me rather than try to address it directly with him seeing as he is not emotionally mature enough to handle criticism someone please help me ,post,male,dealing with a depressed dad hi guys this is probably a rant but

414,depression,2020-04-17,im depressed and i think my mother is the reason so to begin with since im m years old i have started to think about suicide in my life theory life is pointless so the only reason to live for me is to enjoy life since about years though i have had shorter but also longer periods of time where nothing was fun anymore thats when i started to think about taking my life this came to a peak about weeks ago since then until now absolutely nothing has given me joy anymore and that was kind of new for me because in past times when i was on a low i always found something to get my mood back up but with this situation i came to a realisation if nothing brings joy into my life nothing really matters nothing i do can change the situation so it doesnt matter anymore only one thing matters when will i end it and thats how the past few weeks looked like for me i just wake up at pm eat think about death and fall asleep again now yesterday i was thinking about it why now why the last few weeks and not earlier so i was starting to think about the situation and when it all really started what the cause of all this was then i had the conclusion to all of this my mom so to make things easier to understand you have to know some things about me and my mother i was always a person who had the desire of freedom independency and privacy this stood and still stands in direct conflict with how my mother treats me she always needs to know what im doing there is no privacy i have the feeling in order for her to feel that im safe she has to be in control of everything quick reminder im also she always things that her way of life is the best and she thinks she knows what the best way of life for others is now of course she would never admit this but she really lets it hang out most of the time those two characteristics lead to a deadly mixture when it comes to me i always feel supervisioned by my mother if i want to have privacy i need to go somewhere she isnt if i tell her what i have planned or what i might want to do and she thinks it doesnt suit me shell let me know but not in a way of giving me her opinion about it more like the more often she tells me maybe itll change me it begins with the coffee in the morning and ends with my choice of what i study since years every time i put a fucking sugar cube in my coffee shell let me know that she doesnt like that every morning morning like in groundhog day basically what that causes is that i slowly stopped caring about my moms opinion it dont care if shes right or wrong anymore it doesnt matter because when she tells me her opinion she doesnt try to help me she forces her opinion of the imaginary perfect way of life on me my dad sort of feels the same way and tries to support me he talked about how i should figure out my own life and shouldnt be pressured by my mom to life a life i dont want to at first i thought he was wrong about my mom but now i think what he said became reality now when puberty started for me i could never understand kids that would rage at their parents telling them their opinion rebel and so on i was always trying to be nice and chill but in order for that to work i could tell my mom anything in order to have no conflict and thereby neither my dad which worked out but that meant that i could not show my personality so when i got my first pc with years that was where my life was when i was at home i had a couple of really close friends where i could go to but when i was at home my pc was the only place i could be at feeling free rds of my time i didnt live the life i wanted i just said and did things to avoid conflict mainly with my mother  so to bring this into the context of why i feel depressed this is probably the first reason why i never really had any conflict with my mom the past years the trade of is that i feel kind of empty i dont really feel that i have a personality every part of my personality since i was y o was just a show to fit in another cause of my depression is that i started to let my mom know that i dont trust her and that i dont want to hear her opinion i know that i hurt her by reacting abherent which made me feel that i dont deserve her affection regardless of the stuff she still loves me in an article ive read that one reason of a depression can be that the person thinks he doesnt deserve affection and love this is where i started to think that im depressive with that said my only hope for things to change is that i move out but there are some problems with that problem n its not gonna happen in the next couple of weeks unless i move to my dad he offered me to move in and i think im going to do that the next week or so problem n my mom will still have this negative kind of influence on me because we would still have close contact i dont want my life to be negatively impacted by her on the other hand if i give her a cold shoulder it could possibly worsen my depressive feelings i cant just tell my mom the situation im in she would be in denial and tell me that im creating all those problems by myself my questions are should i move to my dads house should i tell her about it should i tell my dad about it is it helpful to get help through a psychotherapist ,post,male,im depressed and i think my mother is the reason so to begin with since im m years old i have started to think about suicide

417,depression,2020-04-18,i m have had lifelong depression and isolation is destroying me im years old and have had a history of depression diagnosed at paired with extreme anxiety my depression has mainly manifested in two big waves the second of which im lost in currently when i was younger it was what i would call an impersonal depression it wasnt me depressed with my actions but was more or less cause by multiple family deaths within months the triggers for the first wave were far from invisible i was blind sided and it hurt me for a couple years fast forward to about a year ago it started to creep back during a job that i had where the boss was a slave drive and who actively yelled at an berated daily the constant day to day negativity was draining and i finally quit the job after months of it not that it was a super long time for a job there was a massive weight lifted but it already did its damage now over the last months my depression has slowly but surely kicked into turbo mode and the current global situation has far from helped ive been in a vicious cycle of self hate recently stemming mainly from my weight but formed entirely of how i see myself not only do i hate the weight i hate the look i hate the voice i hate the personality my therapist asked me what i do like about myself and i honestly could not answer her this then joins up with his asshole buddy loneliness and they make a great tag team of youre ugly and youll will always be alone i had finally really come to the conclusion of my depression and was about to try to meet new people or join new groups to learn new skills i was going to go to the gym again and now this well im not running around screaming like were all going to die but the idea of maybe being stuck like this for up to a year is terrifying at best my school year is over well technically it isnt but my mind shut down the instant in person classes were cancelled i cant go to any bar or join any university club to meet people and now i cant even work out to at least tackle one aspect that i dislike about me i play video games all day because i cant find anything else to do when i am not supposed to leave this is beating down on me as everything is repetitive and i just cant have a proper conversation to the same level as face to face every day is blurring into the next while i would imagine the fogginess of days to be pretty universal right now all the blurred days are painful and exhausting for me i guess what im trying to say is im horrendously alone with extreme depression and just need some support as well as maybe suggestions for things to do to cope with this whole situation tl dr im so blue i dont know what to do that blueberry bitch from veggie tales ,post,male,i m have had lifelong depression and

technically it isnt but my mind shut down the instant in person classes were cancelled i cant go to any bar or join any university club to meet people and now i cant even work out to at least tackle

425,depression,2023-07-28,hi i dont know how this subreddit works but here i am m a nerd a software engineer a cricket coffee and trekking fan a social introvert the guy youd casually ignore or just keep in your contact list as a good to have tried to summarise it as much as i could checkpoint when i was i was basically abandoned by all or any friends i had to this day i have no idea i just show up to school one day and no ones talking to me it was perhaps one of the worst years of my life i would show up to school everyday and just cry my eyes out and literally no one bothered to ask no one checkpoint i had my first girlfriend at we both dated for an year before she left me for her best friend at the time they both dated for years after that checkpoint i had this small group guys including me and girls of friends in my last year of undergrad college i felt really comfortable in that group for months they hadnt told me that the other guy supposedly my closest friend in college and one of the girls sort of dated but split and hence even the group split silently but they never told me and kept pretending slowly the group calls messages meetings died and i was always under the

or any friends i had to this day i have no idea i just show up to school one day and no ones talking to me it was perhaps one of the worst years of my life i would show up to school everyday and just cry my eyes out and literally no one bothered to ask no one checkpoint i had my first girlfriend at we both dated for an year before she left me for her best friend at the time they both dated for years after that checkpoint i had this small group guys including me and girls of friends in my last year of undergrad college i felt really comfortable in that group for months they hadnt told me that the other guy supposedly my closest friend in college and one of the girls sort of dated but split and hence even the group split silently but they never told me and kept pretending slowly the

total up to treatments luckily i started to notice some positive effects of the bilateral treatments after the first few which is why we kept going my depression started to relieve somewhat bringing my suicidal tendencies down and making me more approachable and somewhat happier this really helped me gain the confidence we were moving in the right direction and hopefully nearing the end of the

erectile dysfunction for a couple of years now and he never once thought to make the connection or talk to me about it and at one point to try and help our sex life i had suggested that he read me something dirty that turns him on as i knew he enjoyed reading porn and he enjoys reading his favourite novels to me but he completely dismissed it and made it seem like he no longer read any porn ive become an absolute wreck i thought i knew everything about him i thought we were close enough that he could of come to me about anything and i wouldve been able to be there for him with very little judgement and im still somewhat understanding im empathetic to what hes probably going through right now after hes been caught out and the breakdown of our relationship but he has hit so many triggering things for me at first it was just the hurt and betrayal of trust and rejection sensitivity feeling like im not enough like im not good enough and thats then triggered a major depressive episode for me ive only been able to sleep once i get so drunk and stoned i can barely function ive self harmed again and hes given me space like ive asked for but in the middle of a depressive
