depression,2019/08/28,"It feels like someone else lived my life for me. (17M) Looking back at my life it all seems like a blurry mess. I do have some good memories but they all feel so distant, like someone else experienced them and then told me about them. I remember my childhood before depression, but the last 5 years went by without me noticing and here i find myself, depressed and thinking about the simpler times with my elementary school mates, my middle school bestfriend and girlfriend, whom i broke up with just because I was so fucking immature. I want all that back. I want her back. I want happyness back, no wait...I want to go back in time and punch my stupid younger self in the face and tell him to treasure my friends and not leave them because I felt different and superior, to keep my girlfriend close, because i would never find another special person like her. She was my opportunity and I blew it. These were my fucking teen years and I wasted them playing videogames and listening to alternative music just to feel different and hence superior to others. Instead I now know I've become a failure, I treated badly most of the people I came in contact with and I deserve how I'm feeling now. Just do everyone a favor and go fuck yourself, my stupid self centered younger self.

Just needed to vent, sorry

My only desire is to punch my past self in the fucking face omfg, I fucking hate him!"
depression,2019/08/28,My Parents Don’t Understand I don’t know who else feels this way but it’s like my parents don’t understand and it makes it seem like they don’t care. But I know they love me. I just can’t get over it. They tried therapy with me but it’s almost impossible to tell the therapist what’s going on because I keep crying and shaking and barely thinking about what I’m going to say makes it worse. My parents probably won’t let me take antidepressants because they think I won’t be me anymore. At this point I’m not even sure who I am at this point. Everyone else thinks I’m rude or just don’t care but I do I just can’t feel it. I’m just lost... at this point I want to self harm. What makes everything worse is that when I have to do something for someone they never appreciate it. I used to enjoy helping out with stuff but at this point I just can’t mentally. But my parents force me to and they think I just don’t want to help out people with anything and I’m selfish. They want me to be an example to other people but I just want a simple life. I’ve been in the bathroom crying for ages. I’m also going to a new school now so it is kind of stressful. I’m not sure if everything makes sense or if anyone can even follow it but someone just help me please. Btw I’m 16M

I'm 18M, and I just constantly feel like I'm doing everything wrong, and that everyone else is better than me.  
I've always been very introverted, and would prefer to spend time alone on youtube, rather than going out to clubs etc, but I've started to realise more and more that it is just a distraction from whats really going on inside my head. Things that I enjoy (games, programming etc) are just distractions from thinking. If I stop to think, then I'll usually end up crying in bed. I think I have some sort of dissociative identity disorder, or something of that ilk, and if I stop, I can't help but start spiralling down into ""what is real"" sort of thoughts. Even writing this out, I can feel them starting to come on.

I feel like everything was going decently until the end of (British) college, as I had a close friend that would always be around if I wanted a hug, or just to talk shit, but I've moved away from her, and ever since I've never been able to hold on to friends. I always feel like I'm annoying them, and that if I open up to them, they will inevitably stop talking to me, so I'm always too scared too, because if they are close enough that I would consider opening up, they are close enough that I want to keep being friends with them.

I feel that I am undeserving of proper relationships, that that literally every guy on the planet would be better than me, and if I see a pretty girl, then she will inevitably already be taken, by a more deserving guy that also thinks she is pretty. 

I constantly feel like I just want to stop existing. I dont want to die, I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself, but I feel like Im a complete waste of the limited amount of humans there will ever be. I sleep to get away from people, and in my dreams I end up doing the impossible, like talking normally to strangers, or the most recent one I can remember, where I rescued a girl from the side of the road in pouring rain, and carried her in my arms, and ended up hugging her in some shelter.

I'm also pissed at the world in general, how life is just ""learn to make money for other people, make money for other people, die"", and the fact that instead of ending disagreements with diplomatic discussion, we try to end them with an ""I've got a bigger one that you"" fight.

I am really sorry if this doesnt belong here, or I'm being insensitive, and I am happy to take it down, or edit as necessary"
depression,2019/10/08,"work to live/live to work... am i a bad person for rejecting this? 24M, living with my parents. i have things i'm good at and interested in but nothing that's viable or that i'd ever be comfortable having as a lifelong career. i definitely don't want suicide. i am so tired of weighing on my family. i gaze into the future and see myself homeless on the streets addicted to drugs. sometimes i feel like that's the right path for me... better than dissolving my relations with my family for being a mooch. they are too kind to kick me out. i've been waiting for years but it hasn't happened. i've absolutely tried to change and in some ways i have... but not enough.

i can't imagine working a warehouse job for the rest of my life and paying 400USD in rent for a place filled with cockroaches and a broken water heater. i can't even picture working a part time job even if it were to hypothetically earn me a hefty living (which of course it wouldn't). i just can't imagine routine work. call me a lazy ass, but the reward system in my brain just doesn't see it as a viable way of living. there's something about my brain that convinces me that a downward spiral is the better route, even though i know it clearly isn't.

instead of working to barely survive on my own, i isolate myself in their guest room with my computer near all the things that give me ultimate warmth and comfort. i would be fine with this existence if it didn't put a strain on my family

i have a good heart... i think"
depression,2019/10/08,"Zoloft: Either night terrors or wet dreams, but always sweaty I (27M) have been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) for about 8 months now and and have been at 100mg for about 6 months. I have been having night terrors every single night, extremely vivid, to the point that I wake up horrified and unable to go back to sleep. Sometimes I can’t even tell what is a dream and what is reality. It is discombobulating to say the least, and the disconnection with reality is not helping my depression. Sometimes, I even have wet dreams. Like full orgasm in my dreams. It feels great, but the extreme one-or-the-other style lucid dreaming is draining me. Is there a cure to this besides stop taking the medication or switching? I’m also pretty sick of the night sweats. Sometimes i can’t even tell if it’s sweat, or if I pissed my bed. I’m starting to think it’s not worth it, but don’t want to go back to life bare-bones depressed like I was. Sometimes I feel like this all is just worse. Just a little rant...."
depression,2019/10/08,"Do I (24M) have depression? I’ve been dealing with POTS(Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) and the resulting comorbidities (insomnia, muscle pain, nausea, etc..) for 3 years. It forced me to drop out of school and has kept me from dating again. 

Over the last year, I’ve been experiencing this feeling of impending doom and immense sadness. I feel like something is about to crush me, but that nobody can hear me. It’s so damn crushing. This horrible feeling that nothing will ever be ok, and that everyone I know and love will be dead soon and that I will spend my life alone. I have no reasoning behind it aside from my poor physical health. I have a good family. Decent friends. An ok job. I just have this horrible feeling in my gut that won’t leave.

depression,2019/07/29,"Living with me is like dealing with a middle schooler. I (33M) have clinical depression. Due to an insurance mistake I made, my medication has been tricky this year. I have a high cost deductible this year, which means until I spend $2,300 in medical costs, I have no coverage.

This has made getting my appointments and medications tricky. Recently, I am starting to run out and have to figure out a way to pay for a $300 doctor visit or I won't be allowed any more refills.

I've been depressed and moody lately. Saturday, my girlfriend (31F) asked me to do some things around the house. I didn't say anything, but I guess she sensed I was irritatible about it. Today, she told me I had been acting like a middle schooler.

I know I'm in the wrong here. But it hurts. I've been depressed about a few things lately... We went to a friend's to watch a movie, grill, and swim, and I forgot to tell her about the pool and she was really upset. I apologized four times. She reminded me that I knew how much she liked pools and wouldn't forgive me until the next day (not that I necessarily deserved it). One of our friends told her that I have a pool attention to detail.

Two of my coworkers/friends went to a baseball game and sort of hid it from me. We normally do a trivia thing on Thursdays and they said they weren't able to go, but didn't mention they were hanging out together and didn't invite me.

The thing in common here is me. I'm not enjoyable to be around for my friends, so they aren't inviting me out. I'm not enjoyable to be around with my girlfriend, so she tells me living with me is like working with a middle schooler.

I want so much just to withdraw into myself and save all of these people from dealing with me. I'm garbage. They'd be better off without me."
depression,2019/07/29,"Helping myself and boyfriend cope with depression? My boyfriend (22M) and myself (22F) dated for 3 years, broke up for 2, and are now back together for 2 months currently. When we got back together he said he hasn’t been feeling like himself and after his grandma passed, he has definitely gotten more depressed. He said he feels numb, emotionally unavailable, and doesn’t know how to feel. 
Over the past month he’s become much less engaged with me as in less affectionate and “boyfriend-like”, but always takes time to see me multiple times a week and talk to me through the day on text. I know we love each other very much but this is very draining to our relationship. He plans to contact a counselor this week to go and talk to which I’m very happy about. I’m looking for advice on how to cope with the changes to our relationship, support him, and not make myself unhappy in the process? I haven’t been feeling very happy lately because of how different our relationship has become and how uninterested in simple things like cuddling (for examples) he seems to be. I’ve brought this up to him and he says he just isn’t in the mood to do all of those “lovey-dovey” things and doesn’t want them to come across forced. I’m having trouble not connecting the change to me, even though it’s the depression. I love this boy with my whole heart and want to be there for him through this time."
depression,2018/12/02,"25M, depressed, secluding myself for 4 years, currently in a bad place - Help? Hi,

I just need to get this off my chest so I thought I would make a post. I'm 25, graduated college 2 years ago with a good degree (Mechanical Engineering), but life hasn't been working out how I wanted the last couple of years. I got a DUI earlier this year and am currently on monitored probation. It has made me get sober (poly-drug abuser for the last 7 years, been sober for 5 months) and has made me face some of my mental health problems I've been avoiding for years now. I realize, now that I'm sober, that I've been secluding myself for 4 years and trying to deal with my anxiety/depression with substances. These last 5 months have been hell on earth for me. I barely make it day to day right now. I'm constantly battling feelings of extreme low-self worth. I'm working a shitty job that I hate for $12/hr because I can't get a job in my field. Half the reason is because I can't even get the motivation to apply to jobs. I have an extreme fear for failure and generally sleep away my weekends because I can't get out of bed. I moved to a new state last year (Live in CO, north of Denver) and have made no friends. I sit at home all the time either playing video games or sleeping. I'm trying to face my problems but they seem impossible. I don't know how to make new friends because I have no hobbies other than gaming, which I don't even enjoy anymore. I'm on probation so I can't drink/smoke and don't want to be around people who do. I don't have money to throw around on new hobbies because I'm drowning in student loan debt, probation fees and day-to-day living expenses. And I'm so lonely that it hurts to be alive. I feel like I've been in a depressed/drug-enhanced hole for 4 years now and I have no idea how to crawl out of it. I want to make new friends but I have social anxiety and extremely low self-worth so its hard to open myself to people. I also have nothing to talk about since I don't keep up on current events or watch TV. The only real positive thing I've done is start working out regularly. It helps me not want to cry myself to sleep but not much other than that. 

How do you dig yourself out of a hole of seclusion of 4 years? What do I do for my career? I need advice please."
depression,2018/12/02,"Lonely desperate people WhatsApp group? Hey, I find it really comforting to read your posts and to respond. I feel like you guys are the only ones who get it, who are exactly in my spot, and see through the same clouds which became reality.

What do you think about opening a WhatsApp group for support and ranting? Do you think it will be effective? I'm not sure myself, but want to hear your thoughts.

Btw I'm 37M suffering from an existence sadness and depression, regretting about the past constantly, ans seeing no future as all of the people around me are happy and getting their shit sorted out  (yes, jealousy is an emotion that finds me in every corner.

depression,2018/12/02,"Does anyone else feel pressure to be in a relationship I feel so much pressure at this age to be a relationship. 23M whose mostly been a lone for my entire life. I’ve had a few meaningless hookups, have a well paying job, live in a major metro area with tons of single women. 

My friends are mostly in relationships, starting to move in together and get engaged and here I am on the sideline wondering if my (very) unattractive self will ever find someone that fits with me. 

But then I look at that, and I think, not everyone in life finds someone. That’s the hollowing truth. 

The pressure continues to make me more depressed. Seeing what’s happening around me and the joy and happiness my friends are getting to experience is really ticking me off the last few days. "

My bosses, co workers, family, friends, everyone and that talks to me says they think I’m always mad and that I’m not approachable. Had a job for 2 years where they told me that, and I just started a new job 2 weeks ago and someone has already asked me why I’m mad. 

I’m really not mad. I’m “fine” all the time. I guess I have bad resting piss face? I don’t know... I just don’t know what to do to at least look normal..,

depression,2019/03/19,"Cognitvely dysfunctional teen(16M). Feeling physically and emotionall messed up. Have no motivation or reason to do anything This condition I have had been affecting every aspect of my life. I cannot go in life happy with what's going on with me. I'm thinking I have brain damage, but unfortunately doctors disagree and claim it's some bullshit psycho-related thing going on. I'm extremely confused. I'm constantly feeling brain dead and it's preventing from doing anything enjoyable for me

My biggest issue is motivation. It's hard feeling motivated when you're practically living as vegetable.  I can't function at school, can't talk to people, can't understand the most basic things, can't even masturbate(haven't orgasmed in over a year), confused with existentialism, feeling suicidal, feeling restless all the time, overall just horrible

In my shoes, I don't what to do. I really want to enjoy my life, but I feel like I can't.  Regardless of what I do, I can't feel happy. Meds, drugs, or anything don't help. I even eat healthy and exercise constantly(bodybuilding). I don't know what I should do"
depression,2019/03/19,"My life is and has been a disaster. Advice needed. 20M year old failure. After five years of failure and doing nothing it's time I get my life together. Due to poverty and my fathers declining health I didn't go to high school. But three years ago we finally got the insurance my father was promised for if he ever got sick. Two years, Irrefutable evidence and threatening a lawsuit later and we have money. We're living fairly comfortably now, but unfortunately our lifestyle has largely stayed the same. I don't get out and I've developed so many bad habits and what now feel like addictions. I compulsively eat, masturbate up to three times a day and play video games. It's manifested into major depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I don't enjoy my hobbies anymore the spark is gone. I'm unhappy and it's killing me inside and literally.

After a failed relationship with someone who lied to me and broke my heart and many fake ""friends"" later I can't keep doing this. Unfortunately the environment I'm in only reinforces this lifestyle. That's not to say I'm shifting the blame onto anyone else, I'm to blame for giving into this life. Nothing feels the same anymore everything just makes me depressed half my day is spent laying in bed feeling miserable. My body is horrible I've let myself go in more ways than you could imagine. I'm 300 pounds. My skin is horrible, I'm pale white, moderate acne, I have sores and ingrown hairs on my arms and back. I have virtually no self confidence and bad social anxiety. 

I had a horrible childhood I was an outcast and a loner and we always moved around a lot I never had the opportunity to settle in and find my place. I have many mental scars. People have hurt me, used me and lied to me. I have trust and jealousy issues. I have basically no family that aren't either dead or don't want anything to do with me. My Mother died when I was young and my Father is in very poor health. I still live with him not by choice, but they're many circumstances as to why things didn't pan out I won't go into them here, but basically I'm stuck with him for awhile. We're moving yet again soon to a different state and I want to all this pain and regret behind me in California. This is the last chance I'm giving myself to turn it all around. I know it won't be easy, but if I keep living like I won't even make it to 25. If this doesn't work out I plan on killing myself. I'll have nothing to live for if this doesn't change. Is there any advice someone could give to a trainwreck like me? What is the first step to get out of this five year long slump I've found myself in? 

Tl;dr - I have depression, social anxiety and my life is total mess. I've let myself go and am having trouble getting out of this five year long hiatus from a normal life. Any advice would be appreciated. "
depression,2019/03/19,"Broke up[23M] with possibly depressed GF[22] For the past year,in the city of Chicago, I was with the best gf I have ever had in my entire life. We had so much fun and expressed our feelings multiple times while having only polite arguments about what troubled us regarding our relationship.

During this time, she has told me multiple times that she feels I am the only one who can provide her with the sentiment of safety and calmness but she cannot do that as well, while always feeling bad about it as well as herself ,and worthless regarding how she deals with her life and university studies as a nurse. She also drinks a lot, and in one or two cases 4-5 times a week getting almost always drunk while her appetite was extremely low, something I always encouraged her to fix. As background information, she had lost her mother out of nowhere some years ago, and I deduced that she started drinking after that when in the past she never did, but not like an alcoholic. 

Recently, I noticed that she was beginning to isolate herself from me out of the blue. When I adressed this issue, she responded by telling me she is not feeling very well recently not due to something that I did, but she is thinking about the problems of her life and that leads her to being isolated from me. After not contacting her for about two days, she says she wants to meet in order to talk. When that happened, she told me that she still loves me and doesn't want to be with anyone else right now apart from me but she needs time in order to sort her life out and create priorities, telling me she doesn't want to be a burden to me and waste my time with her problems. She then started kissing and hugging me and mentioned something about us being together in the future as well as she doesn't want me to see her as a friend.Also, she wants me to contact her whenever I want to, without her doing so during this time, and I at first rejected this telling her to contact me whenever she felt like it. I didn't push her or try to change her mind when she announced her decision   and told her that even if I don't like it, I respect her decision completely.

Being devastated and heartbroken since I was having the time of my life I really do not know how to approach this problem. I genuinely care about her being alright but after reading so much about depression related behaviours I am starting to think she is going through with something like this. She has never visited a therapist (or at least I dont know about that). Does she really want me to contact her often? Did she say she still loves me just for me to not get hurt? How can I help her during this time in the hopes of us being together again or at least her getting well?

She looked very sad and was crying that she had to do this to me and I really want her to get well soon. But I cannot stand the thought of the possibility of her telling me she doesn't feel the same for me anymore after a few weeks. If anyone has had a same experience please share your thoughts and ways of dealing with it and most importantly how can I help someone with such an issue, even if that means that I will be a friend to her right now."

depression,2019/04/21,"I can’t let go and it’s killing me. Around 3 years ago I (30M) made the biggest mistake of my life. I was bored with the way my stagnant life and boring marriage. Along with a list of selfish and ridiculous reasons, I had an affair. I told my wife about it within a week, said I was unhappy and wanted out. I almost felt like someone was screaming at me in the back of my head to beg for forgiveness and stop being such a fucker. But I dragged that good woman through the dirt. Had my new girlfriend over while she was away... just behaved extremely trashy and unbecoming. I’m appalled at my actions and cringe in embarrassment when I think back at it all. I’ve hated myself since the day I fucked that other woman. I regretted it since the beginning but I thought this is what I needed. I found out fast that it wasn’t, but I was too embarrassed to turn back. Too much pride to admit those around me the mistake I had made. After 3 years, I still love my ex wife. I never stopped... I’ve begged and begged for forgiveness but know that isn’t possible. I wouldn’t forgive me. No fucking way. Could I even respect her if she forgave me??? How could I look her family in the eye again? Haha I’m such a fucking pile of shit to even ask for her pity. It’s a case of the “don’t know what you got till it’s gone” bullshit. It’s not that I miss the idea of her or the idea of a fully functional family. Because, I have that. I’ve since met someone new, who for about a few weeks made me feel normal again. It’s been a year and half,
We have a 7 month old baby as well. He’s super awesome and makes my world shine. 
Honestly, I’m thankful to have her and my 7 mo old son here because if it weren’t for them, I’d have killed myself already. I miss my ex wife so much. Every time I see her, it makes me remember how big of a asshole I am and how I want nothing more than to hold her. To hear her say she loves me. Every morning, she’s the first thought in my head, I wish I was waking up next
To her still. My girlfriend is really great tho... she’s really wonderful. I make pretty good money, so she stays home with the baby and takes care of the house. I feel terrible for her, being caught in the middle of my manufactured emotional crisis. 
I think about killing myself on a daily basis. How I could do it, who would miss me, how long would it take for them to get over me, would it cause any long lasting psychological damage-can I avoid hurting anyone in the process, what if I disappeared or had an “accident”, etc. It’s bad enough that I will sometimes put my pistol to my head and pull the trigger. Then I’ll imagine that I had died and what happens next. They find my body, but who, and how do they react. How messy would it be? Would I even feel the gun recoil against my head? Would it hurt? 

I’m on a dangerous path and I have no desire to talk to anyone besides frantically typing this out while I’m alone in the bathroom. I needed to get this out there. On some type of platform. I never felt like this before losing my ex wife. But this feeling of hopelessness and hatred has been consistent for about 3 years now. I can’t forget her, I still love her and would literally give anything to have another chance. 

Sorry for errors and whatnot, I’m on a phone. 

TLDR: I hate myself for the choices I made. I put myself in a situation of self loathing and self-hatred with no way out, other than moving on from my ex wife. Which for some fucking reason, I can’t do. I don’t know how much longer I can talk myself out of ending it all."
depression,2019/04/21,"Should I check myself into a mental hospital? 17M in the states

Speaking generally, when should I consider voluntarily checking into a psychiatric hospital?

I don't want it to cost my family a shiton of money. And I don't want to worry them terribly.

I've been having severe suicidal episodes. Panic attacks. Near self harm relapses. Over the past few weeks and I don't know what to do about it. I don't feel like I can function by myself. I don't feel like myself. And I can't trust the person that's in the driver's seat right now, if you know what I mean :/

Am I just getting way over my head with this idea? Maybe I'm just being manic right now. Not sure.

Thank you to anybody that reads this."
depression,2019/04/21,"Told parents and best friend about my depression/anxiety, need some advice I’m a 28M, live away from parents in another state. Today I told them about it because I felt like they deserved to know. They took it as well as any parent who loves their kid could.

I also told my best friend of 14 years as well. His reaction is what I’m most hung up on, tbh. He replied with “I dealt with a lot of the same issues last year” and then (and I don’t fault him for this), went on to more-or-less about how he has his shit together now.

Look, I’m not trying to gatekeep some exclusive “club” that is depression, none of us want to be in the club anyway, but I really feel like he didn’t GET it, you know? I tried to convey that it’s more of a deepset issue, not something that I can fix with life changes, but I wasn’t getting through.

He then mentioned that it seemed like most of our generation is depressed as well. That might be true, but I feel like it’s just a hollow way of trying to comfort me. 

I just wish I could make the people I care about most (parents, friends, gf) understand this shit. I know they’re all desperately trying to reach out and figure out how they can relate to my situation but it really feels like I’m not conveying something properly.

I just wish I could make people understand. I feel like the people on this sub, and my therapist are the only ones that really get it.

Any advice?"

depression,2019/03/08,"Am I asexual or has depression ruined my sex drive? 18M in college, struggling with depression, have never masturbated, never kissed a girl and I’m a virgin. 

Have been depressed on and off for a solid 6-8 years due to personal issues in the past, always had a low self esteem in elementary/ high school, partially because of my failures to date/ interact with girls (embarrassing stories, etc) 

Anyway, here I am in college, having never felt the urge to masturbate before, and struggling heavily to do so much as talk to girls here.  I feel like I don’t even care / have the urge to do anything related to sex, and at this point, I’ve just started ignoring girls as a whole, minding my own business in class and such.  

It’s super hard to put into words but, despite finding girls attractive, I have zero desire to do anything with them, and almost get angry at the thought of it because of how laughably unprepared and inexperienced I am. I’m beginning to think that I’m straight up asexual, just wondering if anyone else has felt this way. "

I'm wiser, smarter now but I've fell so far behind my old friends etc that I just feel I've completely wasted my life.

I have a huge 10 year gap in my CV now where I haven't had an 'official' job that I can put down, haven't had a GF for 10 years because I didn't want to be around any human while I was a mess and ended up putting on some weight in the process. I'm not huge but I feel like I don't have the energy to exercise anymore.

I just have no idea where to even begin fixing these issues. I want the kind of high level job I should have but it's going to be too hard with such a gap in CV, I want to regain my fitness but feel energyless and I miss having a GF but feel so inadequate in my position in life that I can't even begin to try and find one.

For all the wisdom and knowledge I've gained from overcoming a drug addiction, I'm still held in the trap of the problems it's caused me and how far behind its left me from my peers.

So I am a recent graduate of chemistry from university, but its almost a year after graduation and I am yet to find a job that will sustain me. I live with my parents and I feel trapped in my life. I've gotten rejection after rejection from companies and to add to all of this the weekend I got a rejection from a company I though I was for sure going to get a position at the girl I had been seeing for the past couple of months ended things with me and choose another guy over me, almost instantly I felt as though I was not good enough for anyone. I feel like I am not good enough for her or that I don't make enough money or that the past couple of months had just been for nothing with her. I know she did not do anything wrong, technically, but it just hurts you know? I feel like I was lead on and had a chance, I also feel like I fucked it all up. I feel like a failure.

I currently work instructing kids and I am starting to feel like I am losing my control of my job, I was known for being a cheery and upbeat coach at work for the past couple of years but now I feel unfulfilled and just overall down about my current situation in a job where I am not making enough money.

The only thing I feel like I had control over in my life is my body and what I put into it, I go to the gym around 4-6 days a week and they say that exercise makes you feel better but I honestly feel shitty about my life. I honest to god feel like the only reason I am not depressed beyond hope is that I lift a lot of weights and have been losing weight but the joy I get from weightlifting is slowly fading away.

When I speak to him he always complains about not being about to sleep properly (we don’t live together) but I know he puts his laptop on to try to help him fall asleep. He complains about a lot of things, especially work. Should I be worried this is a sign of depression? Or just a sign he hates his job?"
depression,2019/08/04,"“You’re just looking for a reason to be upset.” It’s been a dark couple of months; I just can’t seem to shake the depression that has me in its grip. I’ve been struggling for the past year, even with medication. I keep wondering when the sun will shine on me again, if it ever will. 

Our family (me, 36F, and my husband, 38M, and our 5 children) recently moved to a new house. It was a difficult move with a lot of stress, but things have smoothed out. We left a busy suburban area and moved to a rural area with a beautiful view from each window. Even in my dark times, staring out the window seems to help connect me to the life going on around me. Watching the birds hopping around the yard, and the expanse of lush green grass... it’s not much but it calms me. It reels me back in. I don’t know why. 

I recently came home to a large RV (recreational vehicle) parked at our house. It turns out our friends were in a bind and needed somewhere to park it for awhile. My husband agreed to let them park it at our house, with no real timeline established about when it would be moved. I adore our friends and don’t have a problem with helping them out - except that I was dismayed to find out that the views from the windows inside my house are now obstructed by the RV. No more birds to be seen, no more butterflies or bees buzzing around the yard. No more yard, just a big ugly RV. It’s disheartening, but temporary, I guess. 

I asked my husband if our friends could move the RV to a different spot, somewhere in the yard that didn’t obstruct the view. He thinks I’m making a big deal about nothing. I’m certainly not trying to make anything a big deal. But looking out the window was one of the “safe” things I could rely on while being inside the house. I still yearn to be able to watch nature happening outside while I’m busy inside with chores. Instead of being sensitive or understanding, my husband accused me of using the RV issue as a reason to be upset. As if I WANT to be upset about something. For a guy who has lived with me for almost 20 years, I didn’t think it was possible to understand me any less. 

“I don’t even see you looking out any windows, ever,” he said. “You NEVER look out the windows. You’re just looking for a reason to be upset.”

So now I’m upset. And feeling worse because of this stupid depression that won’t go away. I just wanted to watch the birds outside the windows. I guess it’s a “big deal” to move the RV because there has to be a special truck to move it and who knows what else. I don’t want to be the asshole to bring it up to my friends to move their RV. I will try to hang in there. I completely withdrew myself today, slammed the baby food down and ran crying to my room. Why the hell would any depressed person MAKE UP an ADDITIONAL reason to be upset? Aren’t we already upset about things? The obstruction of my view outside the window is a very real thing to me. It means a lot to me, to be able to see out the window, and I guess I am crazy for being upset about it but what’s new. Now I’m back in a dark place inside myself, just wishing I had the strength to pull myself out of this. Tomorrow I’ll go outside and be with the birds in person. Tomorrow I’ll try harder."

depression,2019/04/28,"Dumb ADHD general life rant Hey guys, first time poster, 20M college student. (Sorry for profanity). Here are some of my incoherent ramblings for the length of an essay, if you read this whole thing, Why? 

Depression hit me with the start of college and I didn't get diagnosed officially until last October, the peak of my issues. I was also diagnosed with ADHD at the same time which I had suspected for a while. Been on Zoloft and Adderall XR since and it's definitely helped me out a good deal. I felt incredible starting off with Adderall, productivity increased so much, I did pretty well last semester. However last few days I just feel like it isn't working like it used to. 2 days in a row now I've done nothing all day besides occasional breaks to eat or (feel shitty for saying this) jerking off. 2 days ago I decided to get high all alone, but I was actually pretty happy, today was gonna be productive. I'd finally start studying for exams. It took me until 1 to wake up tho, took meds, thought I'd feel better, fucking nothing. I took an extra one , thinking it would help as it did once earlier when I grinded out a project with an all nighter, still nothing.

I'm kinda just venting and just realized that losing  the schedule of classes I had to these study days before the exam made me sorta lose some efficiency, but I feel less productive and way more depressed than before. Am I too dependent on this shit? Parents were hesitant on getting it for me initially and I days I don't take it I'm absolutely fucking miserable. 

It's fucking 2 AM and you're reading my dumbass ADHD depression self pity rant, that's for that. Ugh, I'm just so fucking frustrated guys.

I have people who care about me, I'm a good human being goddamnit. Why can't I do some basic fucking studying. Parents worked their asses off to get me here and I can't even get out of bed. It's just one more week, I was doing so good, why now ugh. I slept during the day and can't now, just continuing to fuck myself over

Also I'm just constantly thinking about girls now, glad the Zoloft is fucking over my sex drive. But yeah I feel like I think about it too much, I feel like I should have gone through this back in high school, why now. Is jerking off like 6 times today gonna fuck me over in the long run. It's not even just that I'm.horny I want to feel.desired for once in my damn life. Never had a girlfriend but I'm not a fucking incel who thinks I deserve to have one by default. Girls like confident and motivated guys with personality, not r/niceguys got it. I worked on that and it's helped, like watching charisma on command vids, working out more, developing a fashion sense. I lost 15 pounds but the weight is slowly coming back now. I'm not ugly or fat, 6' 175. Just can't deal with some fucking acne and maybe the fact that I'm Indian. Like I get it, I don't find all girls attractive so they all won't find me attractive either, but I guess tinder failures and porn are fucking over my world view. 

I'm not entitled to anything, but damn it'd be nice for someone that isn't my mom or family friend say I'm attractive. I think most girls might not find Indian guys attractive and fuck it I don't blame them, culture always pens us as asexual fucking nerds. I don't want to ask for compliments cause I feel like a dick doing that, but one of the few friends I have has even said I kinda subconsciously do that, by like bringing up shit I'm proud of. Like last semester i dropped 2 classes and got a c and a d in the remaining ones, but I played a bunch of daily fantasy football and over a few weeks made $1000. Bought some clothes, bought parents and myself $100 watches for Christmas and matched the amount on myself to give to a charity called CRY. When I surprised my parents with all that I was so fucking happy, happiest I've been in a long time. I genuinely want to help people, not just get recognition, but fuck maybe just a little would be nice. I feel.like a dick constantly even though I know I'm not. 

I'll.just end this post here, thanks for reading if you guys did, I really needed to vent and I think this helped at least a little. Yes I have/had a therapist but she's back home and I'm in college so I can't really see her often and the university general therapists are just bad honestly. 

Sincerely thanks for giving enough of fuck to read this far, comments would be nice, just want to talk to someone that isn't my parents repeating the same few points over and over. They love me and care and I love them too but sometimes I just want to talk to anybody but them. Just constantly feel like a burden on people, a couple friends tell me I'm not, I still feel that way tho.

I feel like I'm too self sacrificing sometimes and am gonna be taking advantage of sometime. I kinda am obsessed with Captain America, I think I kinda subconsciously want to incorporate his morals into me, always my favorite avenger. But by just internalizing all.my shitty feelings I may feel like I'm ""saving"" someone else from having to listen to my pain, but over time that's just been damaging myself. I seek the approval.of others so much and I just don't know how to stop ugh

Actually ending it now, thanks for the 5000th time."

depression,2019/10/09,"I feel worthless and unwanted This may be somewhat incoherent I apologise :P I'm hoping to engage with some comments to explore suggestions and clarify my ramblings.

I'm [26M] currently in my 1st year of a new degree at University and struggling hard to fit in. I feel like I'm always the odd one out at gatherings - like everyone else has close friends and I'm just there alone.

I'm hopless with dating/flirting as I think my lack of self worth must be coming out in how I present myself.

For context I'm over 6ft tall, muscular, apparently attractive and in spite of everyone's comments (such as: ""you're tall/good-looking you must have it great with the ladies"") I seem to repell girls with my insecurity. I've even had 2 girls reject me explicitly for being a virgin (they are in friend circles where that sort of thing is known - it's not like I'm introducing myself like that of course).

The biggest problem for me has always been a sense of worthlessness ingrained in me since childhood. As such I find it hard to sell myself whether it's as a friend or partner since I can't really see why anyone would want to be with me. From the rational standpoint I know I have a lot to offer, but the feelings of unworthiness are overwhelming me right now. Even though I’m putting myself out there it doesn’t seem to achieve much. 

It's difficult now too since people can easily play into my insecurities in various ways. Such as no one ever asks why I'm in 1st year or a virgin at 26, but they often do scoff or mock. 

I was abused as a kid and then at age 20 I lost 3 family members and my best friend in quick succesion and it destroyed me (I'm still not sure how I made it this long to be honest...). I never mention these details as justification since I feel like it would be oversharing or a burden, but since I don't say anything people seem to assume the worst (that I'm just a reject/lazy)

Right now I really want to feel wanted, even though I feel I don't deserve it."

&amp;#x200B;

Truth is I (25M) am suicidal. I have been so since 5 years old and for a good while I thought I have it under control. Problem is I am going through emotional hardship, which made me put a date on my calendar when I am going to hang myself. As someone who has worked in field of mental health I know that this is more serious than my usual state of mind and thoughts of suicide. The main reason why I am writing this is that current emotional pain is unbearable and I still need to last until the day on the calendar comes (roughly 4 weeks).

I do understand that I need help, but I am unable to talk with anyone about it as I am afraid they would try to intervene, Reddit full of strangers is the only place where I feel safe to share about what is going on. There are many people who care about me and I know it is going to hurt them a lot, but reality is I simply cannot go on anymore.

I have 2 FWB's who I have sex regularly with but first it was fun to have sex, it is still fun now but something is diff. I dont get all that excited for sex as I used to. I go on dates, mostly make out with girls and feel better about myself but that's the only plus point I have. It's just my physical appearance, I have no degree, no job and I change my personality according to my date. Sometimes I play as a submissive type of guy with 1 girl or sometimes as dominating guy with another one. I do like the female  attention but there is nothing after it. We fuck and they leave but I am there all alone after that.

depression,2019/05/16,So depressed I am so tired of having a pity party but feel like I am having a psychological break down. I am a 37M and just moved back from CA to DC to be with my father who is dying. I feel like my depression is more of a burden on my parents and I do not want to have my Dad die seeing me sleep in bed all day. I came off Cymbalta a week ago and can't even think straight. I told my parents that my sister (an alcoholic) was drinking Vodka in the mornings and we got in a gigantic screaming fight in front of my dying father. I got an Airbnb in the middle of nowhere Virginia just to remove myself from the situation. I used to get really drunk (not so much anymore because I have been depressed and only isolate now). I'm considering going to inpatient rehab for some support. Being at my parents place is worsening my depression. I have a room at a friends place in LA but he is an erratic alcoholic and addicted to cocaine. My car is also in LA.  I'm so lost and wish I could just toughen up. I want to escape.

depression,2019/04/29,"Friend is struggling, how can I help him? Hello r/depression. I've been looking for help for this issue for a long time and I need some advice.

My best friend (20M) since middle school has been struggling with depression for a long time. His anxiety and depression have been bad since High School started, but it's only gotten worse. His anxiety has impacted many areas of his life, including his schooling, social life, learning to drive, etc. He has told me his family members have their own issues to worry about, so he often feels he has nobody to talk to. I've tried recommending a counselor, but a few negative experiences he's had with therapists makes him feel like it wouldn't help at all. I feel helpless and don't know what to do.

What could I do to help my friend?"
depression,2019/04/29,"Never experienced this myself I (23F) consider myself a happy, laidback person. There are a lot of people around me with depression/mental illness. My long term boyfriend (24M), my younger sister, my younger brother, my older sister, my stepdad. So I’ve seen what it can do and how differently it can affect people, so I thought when it happened to me I would notice right away!

Well I didn’t. Seemingly out of nowhere, I feel like I was just weighed down so badly. I didn’t even really notice until my bf pointed out to me how I hadn’t done homework, laundry, or dishes in over a month. (I know that makes him sound bad, but typically I do majority housework because I have more free time. He picked up the slack while I was in this state). Anyways, I honestly felt like I was half of me...just a shell pretty much. I had no appetite, no desire to pull myself off the couch and do something, and I wasn’t really sad so much as I just wasn’t there. But there were moments of overwhelming sadness where all I wanted to do was cry. 

I guess I’m just hoping to get any and all info/advice from anyone?

Part of the reason I think that this is going on is that I’ve had some health problems recently, so I have bills piling up and since I have class 3 days a week I’m only working 2 twelve hour shifts a week and whatever I can get on the weekends, but that = no money. I also withdrew mentally from school and classes are harder and harder to make myself go to, so being behind is making things worse. 

Some of my health issues include a really fast heart rate that we’re trying to figure out...they put me on beta blockers to try and lower it + anxiety levels. They also put me on a vitamin d supplement since my levels were extremely low. I’m also seeing a neurologist for frequent headaches. He has me on a medicine that’s an antidepressant but is also used to treat headaches. 

Before I was put on the beta blocker, I was on cymbalta for anxiety (I didn’t think cymbalta was used to treat anxiety but I’m not a dr). That stuff really made everything worse for me. I honestly felt like I was drowning and there was no way out. That was the worst of it. The beta blocker has lifted me out of that funk but now after using the blocker for a couple of months, I feel like I’m slipping back into that state. I’m randomly so overwhelmed that I feel like all I can do is curl up in a ball and cry myself to sleep. But other times I’m in a really, really good mood! I will feel good about myself and my body and I’ll legit feel like “I can tackle school and my bills!! I will make it out of this no problem!” That’s how the old me would feel majority of the time. And I love feeling that way. But it lasts maybe for a couple hours and then I go back to normal or back to feeling a bit down. 

I’m exhausted going back and forth between these emotions. I don’t know what to do, I’m scared to keep putting all of these medications in me because I’m wondering if they’re the problem (maybe they’re interacting badly or my body doesn’t like them) I just want to feel like me again. I want to have fun and not be surrounded by this dark cloud. I want to be the person who helps lift people out of their funk again instead of being the person who is in it. I’m sorry if I offend anyone by anything I said I just am new to feeling things like this so it’s all very different to me. 

Please, feel free to tell me your stories or anything you found that helps/helped you.

TLDR: I’m looking for advice on how to deal with depression/feel like myself again."
depression,2019/04/29,"Please help I (19M) have been struggling with depression sence the junior year of high school. I stopped taking my meds due to the fact that they make me sick and jittery. My girlfriend of 5 years (19F) recently came out as polyamorous, and said she was already texting another guy. She told me it would never work and that absolutely crushed me. For the first time in over a year my suicidal thoughts re-emerged. I'm scared and dont know if I can make it. How did you guys get through it?"
depression,2019/04/29,"Depression is making me MENTAL First of all, I'm fairly new to Reddit,

I (23M) feel that my depression is pressing towards mental issues that I haven't experienced. I am pretty much scared and built so much nervousness around me. I feel so much pressure that I can't bare to take it no more. I am stuck in a situation whereas if these mental issues increase then I would be more depressed. I am an introvert and you probably guess its qualities, but it is up to this point where I don't have the energy to talk to people. College is already bumming me out since there is two weeks left in the semester. This is my story y'all. I'd love to chat to anyone with open arms with help and comfort!"
depression,2019/04/29,"Parents make me wanna kill myself My mom is a borderline alcoholic power tripping bitch who grounds me to constantly show she's in power. 17M btw my stepdad is a stone cold asshole who only talks to me when I've done something wrong or when he wants to make fun of me. I'm 17 I deserve some freedom and being secluded from my PC and friends makes me feel worse and dwell on things I shouldn't. Though I'm making progress my parents can make me borderline suicidal in a moments notice. Thanks for the vent, any advice or stories are helpful :)"
depression,2019/05/14,"I don't know where to turn... This is my first post on reddit so apologies if I'm doing this wrong. Right now my head is all over the place, and I suspect this post will be too. So to start, I'm 30M, and about 8 or 9 years ago I suffered from really bad depression, I self harmed a lot and was close to suicide several times, but the only thing that stopped me was the fear of failure. I ended up involved in drink, drugs, crime. But I managed to beat that, and turn my life around. I still enjoy the odd drink these days, but I've not touched drugs or committed an offence since. I'm working in a job I love, I'm going on holidays I could only dream about, I'm learning to drive and doing pretty great at it. Life is better than it's ever been, although it's still far from perfect. But my biggest fear is returning back to that dark place. Lately, I'm a completely different person. Normally, I'm so laid back and don't really let shit get to me, but recently I'm getting stressed out at the smallest, irrelevant shit, stuff I wouldn't even notice before, let alone stress about. Every little thing is getting to me. I don't even know why it's getting to me, I'm losing control of the way I feel, I feel helpless because I can't figure out what's causing me to feel like this so I can't work on changing it. I feel like I'm about to either break down in tears, or snap into a rage. I'm seeing similarities to the way I felt when I was suffering from depression, and this is terrifying the fucking shit out of me. I feel like I'm my own worst enemy right now, the more I think about this shit in my head the worse I feel, and the worse I feel the more I think about it and it's one big circle. How can I be feeling like this when life is going so great?! I don't have too many friends, so I don't really have anyone to talk to about this, which I guess is why I'm posting this to a bunch of strangers on the internet."
depression,2019/05/14,"help Well, hi. Im a 15M who has lost his Mother 6 months ago and im not blaming that for everything but im in a tough situation. I didnt grieve because i wanted to be strong for my brother and my dad and now i feel like it fell all on top of me at once. 

I go to a technical school 10hs a Day, (fair to say i never wanted to go to a technic school but my father shoved me there nevertheless, so im not doing very good there). This is giving me quite a shitty Day-to-Day life in wich i basically live there studying something i dont even remotely like Just to have to go to college like everyone, so. 

I also go the gym where i can have a little peace and then back to my house where its back to fighting my father for stupid and non-stupid stuff.
I know he doesn't really mean it, i think, but it makes me feel really bad that my dad says that im a big part of all of his probems.

I recently tried to start a buisness with him but it didnt go so well so now because of my stupid fault he has some debt.

And finally, everybody says that they're there for me, that i can rely on them but thats bs, its Just some made up phrases to say to someone who lost a loved one.

I Just wanted to hear from someone other than my dad telling me to suck it up and deal with it."
depression,2019/08/11,"Depressed Girlfriend Advice Needed My girlfriend(30F)and I(29M)have been dating for 2 years. She battles depression and anxiety. Recently we got in an argument about how come I haven’t proposed yet. She wanting to be married and have children right this instance while she’s working and in school. I want to marry her but I don’t think we are financially ready and that make her upset when I try and breakdown the financials. A child is a lot of responsibility and I don’t want to bring something into this world if I can’t provide the baby with everything I had growing up. She is so upset with me right now she has mentioned that she was to go out of town to be by herself for a night.

I don’t know how I feel about this. I want her to be happy, but I’m also worried on why she needs to leave me and be alone. A part of me is like if she goes and does this our relationship is done. I’m not sure what to feel and it upsets me. Any advice?"
depression,2019/08/11,"Literally I have no friends Before I write anything, the only thing I want to set is my English won't be correct for sure, also I am writing this in the middle of the night. I am 25M, and things started to happen from this year. In the span of 7 months I have lost like 95% of my friends and chat buddies. After a while they just ghosted or blocked me but neither of them gave an acceptable reason for it.

Long story in short, I prefer to talk with females, but I am trying to be nice, and also listen to the other person, but yeah these all still ends the same as always.

Basically I have 1 friend now, but she always claimed she doesn't have time to meet, so we only talk several lines a week or so.

Was trying to find new girls around me to find friends and maybe more, but even if they claim they want to talk with me, it still ends with ghosting or blocking. I just do not get it at all, and right now I am totally outof my comfort zone. Lately I can not sleep well and get up several times at night.

Ps:I am lurking a profile of a girl, she is beautiful but now I am totally not in the right mood to start something, and since first impression matters I should fix my problem somehow."

I already know I’m about to fall back into depression soon .... Fuck! The suicide thoughts are already surfacing. WHAT IS MY TALENT LORD SEND ME A SIGN PLEASEEEEEE
depression,2019/08/11,"Feeling very meaningless Lately I'm (20M) feeling really depressed, I can't find joy in a lot of things that I used to really enjoy doing. I'm starting to get more and more social anxiety.

I'm feeling very empty, meaningless and numb

The thought of ending it all keeps getting in the back of my head, I know I won't do it because that will destroy my parents lives. But I just can't see anything bright in the future.

I came out of a really toxic relationship where I lost myself, luckily I ended it (she was mentally abusing me). Despite her being so toxic I missed her ever since, and I'm just starting to cry when I think about it. 

Sometimes I feel really good, that feeling holds on for like 2/3 days and after that my mind just completely turns in reverse and the thought of ending it all comes back creeping in. It's a rollercoaster where I just can't get out.

I'm just feeling so unsure about my whole life and everything, and I just do not know what to do anymore..

Thank you for reading my post, it means a lot to me!"
depression,2019/07/17,"I’ve dropped off my friends’ invite lists. Sooo. 39M.  Over the past few years, my social life has gone from seeing friends at least once a week, to once a month, to irregularly at cookouts or holiday parties. My friends have gotten busier with kids and work as we’ve gotten older, as have I, but when I see them, we get along and have good rapport- it doesn’t feel like anything has changed. But the invites have gotten progressively less frequent, and the last 2 times I attempted to arrange a get-together in the past 6 months, I received 2 polite declines and radio silence from everyone else. I haven’t been to a social event where I wasn’t a +1 to my wife in 2019."
depression,2019/07/17,"How can I prevent what I feel like an end?    I(15M) feel like everything is going farther from me. My best friend went to France for the whole summer break, and I don't really leave my house.We had a school camp (which in my country lasts a week) and I socialized a lot with new pepole. I made new friends and realized I had the time of my life. 
   As I said earlier, I don't really leave my house. I think I should add that I'm the principle's son. I have been in contact with a lot of pepole over the last years, but it's been a habit not to leave my house and to refuse any outdoor meeting activity with pepole. As I got older I realized that I went through changes and I became more mature. My parents are worried because I sit in house reading books all day, but at this point, after more than 5 years of friends asking me to hang out with them, I feel like going out with friends is an impossile mission. As I said, I was in contact with a lot of personalities as a child, especially bad ones, that gave me a general fear of pepole that I feel like I cannot overcome, no matter how much I feel like I should.
    Also, lately I've been feeling at my lowest and every activity ends with a bad feeling and a hope for some sort of socialization. I am not a hated person in the little society of my town, just that one guy that everyone kinda knows but no one really hangs out with him.


tldr; i did not go out with friends when it was the time, and now i feel sad all the time(i do not want to call it depression, thank God I am far from that stage). also i feel afraid of new pepole and i am scared of their personalities, especially if they are generally lowd or vulgar."
depression,2019/07/17,"It's been 5Months of my Grandmother's passing, and I can't move on. Long story short: She was suffering from Breast Cancer, dying slowly then died by accident.

    My mom and dad split up when I was 6 and I lived with my father. Since my father doesn't always have time for me because he needs to go abroad, my grandmother, and her 3 sisters took care of me. Because of that, I grew up introverted. (I have lots of best friends but I don't open up to any of them.)

     I am spoiled by my Grandmothers. But only one truely cared for me like a real mother, she pretty much does everything for me. (Ironing, washing clothes, cooking, chores, and groceries) and was in her care until she got diagnosed with Stage 3 Breast Cancer and gout last year, January 2018.
    
     It's a very tough year. Cancer is painful the doctors said, gout is even worse. She is in agony for a year. She cries very loudly like a child and sometimes yells “I can't do this anymore” , “Lord take me please”, and “Mom, please take me with you.” and I was there hearing it all.
While in pain, she still does everything, washing, cooking, etc. but there was one time that she could not stand up anymore.
    
      We did everything to ease her pain, but none worked.
A year of her, crying in agony really hurt me since I have no one to talk to about it.

     Because of her, I always go out and drink alcohol with friends, as an attempt to relieve myself.

     A year of has passed, January 2019. The doctors successfully removed the tumor in her breast, but there was nothing they could do with her gout. She was in the hospital for a week. So that's enough free time for me to drink actually almost forget what's happening.

    I came back home and she was there, with all 3 sisters. Half of her face was drooping, and tube wires everywhere in the house. She struggled to smile at me. I ran away, crying outside and cried myself in a dark place. After that I went home when everyone is asleep. I went to bed and keep telling myself “That is not her.” but I had no choice and continued to isolate myself.

        3 weeks later, January 29, 2019
   A small stitch in her breast wound opened up and we didn't know. She pooped something very black, and that's when we knew she was internally bleeding. She was sent to a hospital via ambulance but it's a dead on arrival. Cause of death is she ran out of blood.

    I was prepared for her peaceful death but not in a sudden one, and that's why I was devastated.

I suffered like normal people would, but I'm actually not getting better.


Anyways, thanks for reading."
depression,2019/08/31,"My brother is having a bipolar schizophrenic episode (vent/advice needed) My brother (32M) is in a pyschic ward for two days since he threaten to kill my mom with a knife. He obeyed her to clean the bathroom while he was threatening to kill her. He has been very aggressive and we feel unsafe around him. It could be that he is using drugs. Worsening the mental illness. I didnt want to call the police at first, but I had no choice anymore. I never seen him like this, his face is skinny, he doesnt take care of himself, his hair is balding, his behaviour is unpredictable, I wish I could do anything to help him, but I cant do anything. And it does makes me sad that i cant help. Im lost at the moment and I cant talk to anyone about it. I feel sad and alone, its hard to cope. 

6 months ago I adviced him to go on vacation for a while to ease his depressive mind, but something happened over there, he came back 1,5 weeks over due and lost his mind. The last 6 months he made up a manipulative story to quit treatment and medication. Since then it has been heavy on our minds. His therapist sucks, we have been warning him many times that he is having a manic episode. but he said it was better then laying in bed all day. I dont want to blame anyone but sometimes I feel even they are letting us down. 

My brother was/is a smart guy, but something snapped and now he cant even have a normal conversation. He will tell me im a good person and another second he says he hates me and tell me to fuck off. My patience is running out, I dont want this anymore but theres no one else that will take care for him. My family is done with him, and to be honest so am I. Im strangled in a decision, I feel I cant give up on him. But, it will ruin my life. My quality of life. This situation  reminds me of a qoute in a movie called “Beautiful boy” after her daughter overdosed on drugs: 

“So I guess I’m in mourning, but I realized something else. I’ve actually been in mourning for years. Because even when she was alive, she wasn’t there. When you mourn the living, that’s a hard way to live. And so, in a way, it’s better, I guess”


My brother is still alive, but I feel he isnt there. But a entity taken over him. 

I dont know what to do. I need to rest and find a way to take of myself and him."

depression,2019/04/08,"Not suicidal thoughts, but are they still an issue? Background:

34M. I have trouble sleeping, then try and sleep through the day. Avoid friends, family and society in general. Don't eat. Then suddenly over-eat. I hate going out. I don't do what I love doing..never seem to have the energy or the attention anymore. All my life I've done the best I possibly can to be a good person.. but life is..kinda poop. I live 14 hours away ( by airplane ) from home. I used to be super social a decade ago. I have to interact with people at work (just lost my job so I'm freelancing), and smiling makes me tired. I'm exhausted..., Well I feel exhausted..., pysically and mentally 

I don't think about killing myself. My mom would be hurt. A lot of people would I guess. I sometimes find myself thinking about (maybe fantasizing) about getting hit by a car..., or shot, or being in a house fire. Is this something I should seek help for?

I have not gone to seek help. Financial reasons prevent me from doing so. So Im not even sure if I should be posting here. If not, tell me this shit is going to pass and that I'm being paranoid or idiotic or something.

Thank you."
depression,2019/08/19,"How do I convince my doctor to prescribe Vyvanse for Depression? One of my co-workers has a prescription to 30MG Vyvanse and I recently took one. It made me feel like a normal happy human being for the first time in years. I didn't feel crazy wired or anything of the sort, I just felt normal. Currently I take 125mg of Zoloft for depression and 5mg of Xanax for my anxiety. Neither of these help much, if at all, and always end up making feel drowsy or out of it. I have made a doctors appointment for later today, and I wanted to know if it was okay for me to tell the Doctor exactly that, or if he would say no, since I took it without being prescribed.

depression,2019/06/01,"I(15M) wrote a rap song about my depression. (Not Suicidal) [For context on my experiences, this is my post about them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/b9hg3e/i_dont_know_what_to_think/)

This is going to get lost in new, but I don't care I just wanted to share it. Obviously I can't perform it, I'm not a rapper or a lyricist, nor do I have what I need to perform it. Let me know what you think, I'm not a lyricist so it's probably not that good. I've posted this to r/teenagers too.  

I know that you love me, you know that I love you

I want to tell you about the things that I’ve been put through

I only wish that you as my mom knew, and my dad too

How you make me feel when you berate me for minor things

I know that you’re trying to make me a finer man, so I can bring

Pride, knowing that you raised me as a fine person

But I might worsen, with sadness lurking, as you make me feel like a bad person

For not contributing enough, or being lazy and stupid, my mind is hazy and lucid

At the same time, and I am trying, but I’m struggling to prove it, ‘cause I’ve lost motivation

Due to my depression, this is my confession, I feel worthless

I know you won’t believe me, and telling you would prove fruitless

I seem like a happy kid but I beat myself down

You tell me that I’m smart, you tell me that I’m cool, but really

I feel dumb, like a fool, but I shouldn’t be, in theory

My life is good, my parents are involved, but my mood revolves

From happy to gloomy, in different times of day

I never feel either side all the way, except for my gloom, in actuality

In reality, I never really feel happy, only okay to no, wait-

What am I saying, it doesn’t really matter,

You aren’t going to hear it, so love me or not I often feel the latter

Even though in my heart I know it’s the former, but rather

Tough or harsh or misguided love, and even if I don’t believe in God

If he’s up there I hope that he can see from abroad

That I need something that I don’t get right now, and that is appreciation

But every time you yell at me all I feel is depreciation

I know you’re just trying to prepare me for the real world

But I feel burdened, or maybe I should feel that way

Either way my true feelings are furled and curled up

Into a ball and thrown deep into the caves of my brain

Don’t know why I’m feeling this way, maybe I am lazy, maybe I am stupid

Or maybe these problems are more deeply rooted

Whatever the answer I’m doubting myself

But deep inside I’m thinking, “why help thyself?”

I can’t, and I have no one to turn to

I wish I was happy, I wish that were true

I’m not perfect, so maybe I can learn too

But I hope that someone understands me

Then, someone can listen empathetically

As I let out my emotions, pathetically

This is nearing the end so to everyone listening, I hope that this suffices

Just know that I’d never harbor vices

To the people that made me and raised me as who I am today

But when I feel truly happy again then that’d be the day

That I have finally, finally broken out of my gloomy daze"
depression,2019/06/01,"Need advice on how to deal with my(29F) parents(60M,60F) grief/depression from brothers(30M) recent suicide   

Hey guys, I’m new to reddit but I hope to get some advice on how to deal with some rocky family dynamics. If this isn’t the right subreddit for this please point me in the right direction. 

Two years ago my brother died of suicide after 12 years of struggling with his bipolar and addictions (cocaine, alcohol, meth, pain killers, probably more). Him and I had a very poor relationship the 3 years before he died, with me trying my best to cut him and his drama out of my life. My parents had always been very enabling of his addictions and very poor life choices, so when I decided to cut him out of my life, they did not see it my way. In fact the last time he relapsed, my parents started treating me poorly and chose him over me for family events (as I was the one who was being unreasonable). When he passed away I obviously was devastated, I always held onto hope that he would get back on his meds and stop self medicating with illegal drugs. My parents (and extended family) were crushed by his death, my parents always hid his addictions and mental illness from family and friends so I was left being the one explaining to family how bad things were and how he was a bipolar addict. Yes we tried numerous times to get him help, 100k worth of private rehab later he just became better at manipulating people.

I held it together as best I could since my parents were destroyed by his passing. It took me about a year to get back into my life routine and accept he was gone. Part of why it took a year is because my parents guilted me into doing so many things with them during that year. I live 4 hours away from them, but it was always expected I’d drive up for anything remotely family related. This really impacted my job/life. So after a year, I decided no more, and started telling them no. Now it’s been 2 years since his passing, but whenever I see my parents its like it only happened a month ago. I started to dread seeing them because they try to pull me down into their vortex of grief and sadness. It would take me a few days after seeing them to get back to my usual happiness level and shake off their depression. I’m not sure if seeing me just reminds them that he’s gone? Or maybe they’re always this way now? Either way I can’t continue like this. I love my parents and want to see them but it’s too much. How can I navigate this situation? Should I be upfront and just tell them that their negative attitude every time I see them affects me strongly and that’s why I’m avoiding them? Or should I continue to just ignore it and blame being busy with work for why I only see them every few months now? 

TL,DR: Parents are devastated by my brothers death, their grief is still so strong 2 years later it’s negatively impacting my life/mental health every time I see them. Should I point out that they’re projecting their grief onto me and that’s why I’m avoiding them now? Or just ignore it and hope they don’t get more upset that I’m absent from family things?"

depression,2019/08/20,"After 2 years of finally feeling happy, I'm again thinking of trying to kill myself... About a month ago, I lost everything that took me great effort to achieve during the past 2 years. On a single unexpected moment it just all went down the hill. Now I see no value in my life again, and after this, I don't I will ever find value in it again.


I (20M) struggled with depression throught my entire teenage years, to the point in which I actually tried tl kill myself and ended up in the hospital because of it (I was 16 at the time). 


When I started college (I was 17), I was doing very poorly. However, one year later (now 18) I met some very good friends. Through them, I was able to get better mentally and academically. This is important because I was never good at making friends, at all. I'm really introverted and reserved. 


Then, another year after that (now 19) I started my relationship (first ever) with someone that I eventually thought would be my partner forever. For a whole year my relationship with her was almost close to perfection. She was even the first one to say that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, so naturally I got hooked on that beautiful thought. 


The problem was, I got so hooked on it that I basically ignored all her red flags. Through our relationship, she didnt want me to hang out with my friends unless she was coming with me too.....  but she never wanted to hang out with them. So, little by little I lost all the friends that took me great effort to make because I never hung out with them again. However, I didnt think much of it because I was under the believe that my relationship was going to last forever, and to me she was the only person I needed in my life. Even if it was only me and her, I felt fulfilled.


It all went down the hill this year when she enrolled in this international academics program. Long story short, in May this year she went away for it, and barely a month after she left she abruptly ended our relationship. No real explanation given, only what sounded like a cheap excuse: ""I don't feel like you fulfil me"". I asked in what sense and she never gave me an answer. 


Along with that, my grades in college immediately tanked in the summer term. 


So now I'm all alone again. Lost my friends, my partner, my grades, and all my motivation and will to live along with it."
depression,2019/08/20,"Suicidal tendencies can be relationship destroyers. I (23F) was hospitalized in January and nothing has been the same between my fiancé(24M) and I since. I regret attempting to take my own life more than anything, nothing would’ve been more selfish if I would have completed. So I can understand why he can’t look at me the same for the past 7 months. For the first time since we started dating 6 years ago, I feel stuck in a world where I can’t tell anyone how I truly feel. 

My therapist is a nice lady I just need to get in the habit of being more open with her, instead of my fiancé."
depression,2019/07/22,"Struggling with lack of motivation and fear of possibly changing colleges I am 21M, diagnosed with ADHD, and studying Civil Engineering at an out of state college ranked in the top 20 for Civil Engineering. I am currently going into my 3rd year there (I plan on taking 5 years) and am enrolled in 2 online courses for this summer (having already completed a 3rd). 

&amp;#x200B;

I should also say before hand that I'm currently medicated and seeing a therapist and just need somewhere to talk.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was going fairly well until last semester (Spring 2019) where depression, which previously barely manifested itself, seemed to hit me out of no where and all of a sudden I could barely get out of my room for classes, I no longer enjoyed the things I used to, and had nearly no energy at all. Because of this my grades went down, though I managed to pass all my classes except for one which I dropped part way into the semester.

&amp;#x200B;

I love my school, though it is difficult I have found success there in the past, and I have a small but good group of friends there (though I do find it hard to socialize and often tend to be/feel alone). This summer working on my online courses I've found it even harder to get motivated and do work compared to back at college and this has led to one of my courses grades going in the toilet. The problem with this is that my parents told me that they're viewing these summer courses as sort of a trial period to see if I can get myself together enough to send me back to my college, or if I need to transfer to a more local college. The only problem is that I don't want to change colleges and just know that whatever I try to do to convince myself otherwise that if I change colleges and goo back home I will always view myself as a failure and the thought of that makes me want to break down crying even now.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what I have to do to go back, just pass my 2 remaining online courses, yet I can't seem to ever get motivated I have no drive to go forward, no energy to do my work, and I feel like an emotional wreck about to break down at any moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do to get myself motivated, my parents have told me that we all have to do work even though we lack motivation and yet it feels like theres some rope tethering me to my room and making it impossible to do work. My 1st semester freshman year I faced a similar situation with lacking motivation to work, though this was due more to me not understanding just how much work needs to be put in during college. I was failing all my classes and there were 3 weeks left before finals and the thought of failing and my poor performance up to that point pissed me off and I was angry with myself for letting things get so bad, so I directed that anger to studying I basically slept in the library devoting my all to studying for the finals to the point my friends were a bit concerned. The result of this was that I passed all my classes.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet right now I don't feel that same anger that I used to drive me forward, I don't have that fire in me which led to studying for 16 hours a day for a week straight, and all I feel now is hopelessness and anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any suggestions/questions or just want to talk and trade stories feel free I love talking and telling stories yet have nobody around to do so with."
depression,2019/06/27,"The inevitable decline of health with age has become unbearable, [23M].  

At best I have 15 years left before the decline starts to really kick in, at which point in time the constant reminder of my age becomes more frequent than the benefits I get from life. I'm currently attending University (entering my last year after the summer) and actually enjoying myself from time to time. However, this time will pass with graduation as I will lose all my my friends I have made during my time there, and the amount of free time I have will decrease dramatically. Not just that, but during the second year of University I learned that I simply don't have the passion anymore for my subject. I cannot see myself working in that area anymore, and in fact anywhere. All jobs involve endlessly running in circles until your mind becomes so numb you lose all awareness while you're there. I have no interest in forming relationships or someday having kids, in fact, I'm a virgin. I am straight but have never had enough desire to actually follow any of those urges. After University or hitting that certain age I feel like there is nothing left more me anymore. I will constantly be reminded of what once used to be and can never me regained. All my losses will serve as constant reminder. I can't stand this anymore. But I also can't work up the courage to kill myself just yet. I hate the feeling that my life will just suddenly end and everything will keep on moving endlessly without me.

It's been two days since I returned from a trip that will probably form one of my most enjoyable memories. Since I'm back I have cried everyday realizing again that I cannot be happy like that all the time, and that for every inch of joy I have pay with miles of suffering. Maybe even this would be tolerable if it wouldn't be for the constant reminder that all this will eventually will pass. These thoughts are constant and I can't escape them. I think my only goal at the moment in life at the moment is to work up the courage to end it.

Sorry for any grammar mistakes, but I simply dont have the energy to reread my words right this time."
depression,2019/06/27,"Etika's death has made me realize that I've been carrying this shit for more than I thought. 17M. Lately I've been feeling almost like the worst I've ever been. Having finished school made it worst because I used to see my ""friends"" everyday and laugh about stupid teenager things, these last 2 years of school I dealt with anxiety and sleep problems, if it wasn't for my mum I had probably dropped out of school, but thankfully I managed to finish my pre-university studies. Everyday I went to school with 2 or maybe 3 hours of sleep, when I arrived to class I looked down, sat down next to my friend and looked down to my book for the whole class, not sleeping enough really destroyed me. Some classmates asked me if there was something wrong, I always said that it was nothing and kept the days going hoping that things would get better. 
That's the thing, I didn't have close  friends until I was 16, I always said to myself ""maybe tomorrow they would ask me to hang out""  I turned on my ps3 and kept on going. 
If someone is reading this, please never give up. I'm almost crying right now, I don't know why.
I've never felt suicidal because I always thought that If i finished my studies I would be able to have time for videogames or tv series. So maybe I can say that videogames have kept me alive and at least somewhat sane, everytime I play videogames I forget about not having good friends or thinking that I'm trash as a person.
Please take care."
depression,2019/06/27,"I need a solid diagnosis, having difficulty getting back up this time...   

I’ve always been a fighter and gotten back up but I’m starting to feel like I’m going to stay down this time for a while. I’m exhausted, in every way that you can be. 

I’m 37M, married to HS sweetheart, 2 amazing little kids. I’m an RN and have a cake job by nursing standards. I have seniority and have great coworkers but I can barely pull myself out of bed to get to work and that’s the easy part. It’s like pulling teeth trying to get me to get anything done at work. I sit there, exhausted and zoning out and then work in spurts to make sure I do what I need to. 

I think about suicide constantly but have only felt legitimately scared for my safety once, a year or so ago. I’ve lost a couple of very close friends recently, one to suicide, and I think of them daily. That’s the only real tangible thing I can point to that saddens me.

I’ve struggled with what I would call depression and anxiety for about 20 years. On and off meds at times – diagnosed at different time depresson/anxiety (Zoloft (still on low dose), Lexapro (worked ok), Wellbutrin (gave me more anxiety)), rule out bipolar (lamictal (made my hair thin), trileptal (just stopped taking, saw no change), and low dose abilify (made me hypomanic for a couple weeks until I stopped taking), and ADD (Adderall XR – actually helped my mood/energy quite a bit but it would make me feel a little out of it). 

My symptoms:

\- mainly inability to sit still or concentrate most of the time unless it’s something I find particularly interesting (this started in junior high and continued through multiple degrees – I would just cram for tests/assignments and always did well), tired CONSTANTLY, and recently feeling extreme anhedonia at times. I’m extremely nostalgic and all of my memories (even happy ones) just make me sad at this point. It’s very difficult for me to listen to a lot of music as it all reminds me of the past and I get sad. 

\- I’m extremely vigilant and it causes me to always be somewhat agitated – it’s hard for me to ever totally relax and enjoy myself without substances.

\- When at work I always feel out of it/like I’m walking through a dream kind of thin

\- I’ve always been weird about senses (the way my clothes fit, touching certain textures/substances, etc.) and (for multiple reasons) my wife believes I may be somewhere on the autism spectrum. 

\- Substance abuse – long family history of alcoholism and I struggled myself before, more in control now. I have also struggled with low dose opiate (hydrocodone and tramadol) use – opiates make me extremely euphoric 

Good things I’ve done: quit smoking completely a year ago, though I was a very light smoker. My eating habits over the past few months have been great compared to how they were the last few years (mostly binging sugary foods). 

I’m kind of giving up after a handful of meds and diagnoses over the years. I guess I’m writing hoping that someone will have insight into what may be my proper diagnosis so I can really try to address it. I’m not suicidal, but I feel like I need a long break from life which obviously isn’t possible. 

Thanks if you read this whole thing or even skimmed it and I would love any insight."
depression,2019/04/07,"I don't know what to do with my life anymore, it just feels like it's over I (17M) really feel bad posting on here since I haven't helped anyone else out. I just feel so empty inside. 

I used to be a great guy who was a track captain, marching band leader, student council, 4.0 GPA and all that. I was the golden child. But on top of that, I wanted to help out other people who are less fortunate. I used to go every week to the food pantry to volunteer, I used to stay up nights with people going through what I'm going through right now, and every summer I used to go abroad to a third world nation and volunteer in medical brigades because I used to want to work with Doctors without Borders as a career. All of this is because I believed no one deserved to suffer, but I feel like I'm one of the few people in the world who believe that and that everyone wants to see ME suffer. 

That really all changed when depression hit. One girl did something that drove my best friend and me apart and then that best friend went on to alienate me from everyone. That's where it all started, from there it was just a rabbit hole of getting sadder until I wasn't able to be happy at all even when things were going right. I was hospitalized twice from suicide attempts, I seek therapy but it's not helping, yall know how it is. 

Through many of the initial stages, I had my schools' marching band to be a support group for me. I had been kicked out of a lot of the things I was in but the marching band and the summer brigades I went on felt like the only places where I really belonged. We had a groupchat we called the ""support squad"", the marching band lost some of our members to suicide and we had all agreed to help each other out, and I used to help out others on that chat but I never really sought help from them because I didn't want to be a burden, the same way I feel right now. But one day my band friends, who I trusted more than anyone, went to my band director and spread a bunch of lies and got me kicked out. The Band director believed me, but he still kicked me out cuz I was ""too negative"".

That was really it for me, even when I was positive after getting mostly cured of depression with my hospital stays, he still wouldn't take me back. No one wants me back. What's the point of even trying if I'm the only one I know who wants to get better. I feel like its a cycle of I get depressed, people make it worse, I attempt suicide, those same people cry for me and say things like ""I'm always here for you"", I get better and more positive, and then everyone shuts me out again, making me depressed, and so on. I can't go back to the hospital, I don't know what to do anymore. My parents are going to take me out of the summer brigades cuz of my dipped grades due to my lack of motivation and then I will really be good for nothing. 

I'm sorry for ranting, its been on my chest and I have no one to go to which is why I'm glad I discovered this. All I wanted to do was be a normal kid and help the world out. I wanted to go to parties and have fun with friends and do things like prom and mall runs but that was all robbed from me, I had to dip my own birthday party yesterday and go cry in my car because my friends will do anything to hurt me.  I wanted to be a guiding light for everyone, even more so now that I know what its like to suffer, but I'm just not the help and the great person I used to be and sometimes I feel like the best way to help everyone out is to just go away. There's just no purpose left for me besides existing, while all the people I helped are going on and achieving great things while shutting me out, I'm just there being a good for nothing useless piece of shit. 

If anyone does need hmu ill give you my contact and I can try to help you, I'm just not as good at helping people as I used to be.

I (22M) just realised how badly I treated my SO three years ago.

This happened when I was 19. I was going out with this amazing girl, my first GF, and everything was going great. I had just started uni, got myself a part time job and met the first girl I truly enjoyed spending time with. 
However, as time went on, about 4 months into the relationship, I started to lose interest in everything found myself not wanting to do anything. I even struggled to get an erection with my GF. I was feeling constantly exhausted and just found myself not wanting to get out of bed. Just felt completely disconnected with everyone and everything. Now after all this happening to me everything coming together somehow depression never even crossed my mind.
But I started pushing her away without even realising what I was doing. At times ghosting her for a week at a time, it wasnt just her it was all of my friends basically became a shut in. I was stressing out about uni because I wasnt doing well. I had realised I was spending more time on my job and GF than I was on my studying. I started getting filled with anxiety about fucking up uni and losing all my hard work I had put in to get where I was. Without realising it I pushed her away and we had, what should have been, a small argument about how I had been getting more distant. Instead I took offence to it because I thought she was being unreasonable, at the time. Right in the middle of my exam period to be pulling me up for being more distant when I was stressed beyond belief. I saw this fight as an escape route. But I never actually properly broke up with her. Turned out it would be the last time I would ever see her. We ended up ghosting each other, I am 99.9% sure she was waiting on me to text or call her, making me the biggest POS in existence as well creating, at this point in my life, my worst decision I have ever made. 

But that wasnt the real me! I am kind caring, and the last thing I would ever want to do is hurt someone that cares about me! I was just mentally fucked up and didnt even realise it.

For the next 2 years after all of this happened I did uni work, which stressed me out, I played competitive video games which stressed me out, and I went out every week at least twice which made me tired. So I wasnt helping myself and being unhealthy but I just wanted to be constantly busy so I wasnt left with my thoughts.
At this point I was at my lowest constantly considering of killing myself failing at uni, alone with a good group of friends and my family. Not wanting to get out of bed and just completely done with life. I was still in complete denial that I had depression. How can I have depression? I have great friends and family and I'm on the course I've always wanted to do, I get food on my plate every day, I can get clean water whenever I want. What right do i have to be depressed?
However, one day when I was having one of the worst panic attacks I've ever had. Worrying about all the uni work, my dissertation, my exams, my assignments, my groups projects. I didnt touch my phone and ghosted everyone. Much like I had done 2 years prior, which for the first time ever triggered a thought within me that something wasnt right.
I was just watching shite on YouTube, as per usual, and I saw this video with stormzy talking about how depression had gotten to him it suddenly hit me like a truck going at the speed of light, if that guy can get depressed. Someone who reached peak of music, got awards and tonnes of money is depressed, then I sure as hell can get depressed.

I suddenly realised that thinking of getting run over by a bus just so I wouldn't have to go to uni wasnt normal thinking. Thinking aww maybe if I just let it run over my legs just so I couldn't walk would mean I wouldn't have to go to uni. I realised too late in fact it was uni that had been my source of depression. Well fucking duh!

I however, stupidly, was very embarrassed that I had depression so I hid it. ""I ain't no fuckin pussy"" I remember thinking to myself. So I didnt tell anyone. Kept going on about it my final year of uni I completely fucked it up beyond belief nailed my dissertation but failed every single class that year.

I went out after my last exam, knowing I had fucked all of my exams, with my uni pals. I was in such a bad state of mind I wanted to go out get blind drunk and take every drug under the sun just so I could feel something positive for once. Looking back I think I was hoping the drugs would kill me, but thankfully they didnt. I woke up in some girls flat no idea where the actual fuck I was with her trying to pull my trousers and boxers down. I just went with it because well tbh I had no fucking clue what was going on. I kept blacking out throughout it. Turns out I had taken way too many drugs and my dick was smaller than a raisin, could have also been the depression but feel drugs were more likely for this case. She got offended that I wasnt turned on by her and she kicked me out her flat into the cold night. I would like to add that this was a rare occurrence because I hadn't been interested in anyobe sexually, other than porn, since things ended with my GF.
I Luckily still had my phone and called one of my best pals who turns out lived right around the corner from this girls flat. He rescued me and I stayed at his.

I then realised that I should get help. I told my mum and dad that I thought I was depressed and that I had been feeling suicidal and wanting to harm myself. I was so scared to tell them, now I cant think why I was scared but I was shaking out of fear. They were immediately so supportive and have been helping me through it ever since. Dad has bupa family cover so I was able to see a physiologist and I have been seeing him ever since. I now have a full time job in engineering, the field I wanted to go into.

I was starting to get back on my feet, finding interests again, wanting to learn new stuff again, just wanting to do everything! It was amazing it was like I had these weights on my shoulders just lifted off and I had been wearing dreary filter glasses all that time.

So I decided that I would be interested in dating again. Immediately, met this girl we got on really well. Cutting a long story short she broke up with me in a pretty shitty way, not nearly as bad as mine. Which then brings us to today I have just come to the realisation of how much of a piece of shit I was to my first GF, and frankly embarrassed how long it took me to realise it.

But as I said earlier I haven't been myself for 3 years without even realising it.

So here comes the questions. I wanted to reach out to her and apologise and ask to meet up so I can explain myself. But then I think I'm being selfish because she has spent the past 3 years moving on probably and I dont want to dig up her past like that. Considering how unbelievably shitty I was to her, and just heap it all back onto her. But then I feel like she deserves closure, but then is it really me that's looking for closure? Once again bringing back the am I being selfish? Is even getting back together with her a possible outcome? Would she even want me back after what I did to her? How could she trust me?

I guess what I am trying to ask is what is best for her? Not to contact her or to contact her?

Tldr: was really shitty to my GF, turned out it was because I was depressed and I'm filled with guilt and regret with how it ended. Should I try reach out and apologise?"
depression,2019/02/11,"My(20F) Girlfriend cheated on me(24M) with multiple people at school feels like a nuke went off inside me i've been a wreck since  

**ack story:** I am 24 and live and work on Long Island my now Ex-GF is 20 year old Junior who goes to school in SUNY ALBANY. My now EX GF and I have known each other for many years our families are very close with each other. She and I have been hooking up on and off for the past few years and have always liked each other. We didn’t date at first because she was still in high school and I was in college plus the age difference. I never loved anyone like this girl and couldn’t believe I could like someone so much and be under their spell. Our official relationship began over the summer near the end of July. We rarely fought and had great sex and our families were very happy we were finally together. We’ve talked for many years about getting married and having kids.

However, there were some red flags that I ignored early on because I was in such love with her. She constantly talked about her ex-boyfriends(Matt V and Garry, Matt P and Noah) she went to school with and it kinda annoyed me. If even looked at another girls snap or instagram story who was just a friend from high school she would flip out and me. She was made me not use social media around her such as Instagram(unless I posted photos with her) and delete all girls even friends off my Snapchat and phone contacts. She also made me also stop hanging out and talking with one of my best friends who was a girl who was basically my sister. I agreed to all this because I loved her and was under her spell. While I would post her on my social media such as facebook and Instagram. She did not put up a single post of me. Not to brag but She would post up pictures with my fathers nice cars and summer home but none with me ever. I asked her why she didn't post me on social media she's like i'm gonna wait to the school semi-formal to post you and no one has to know my business. She also is going through lots of difficulty with her family. Her father used to be a major lawyer but now is a struggling drug addict in and out of jail. Her mother is struggling to make ends meat to send her and her sister to school and pay her mortgage. I know this a bad situation but she would use it against me to get her way always with things and turn a blind eye to her childish behavior.

When she left for school in late August, I felt everything was fine with our relationship. We shared each other locations so I know where she was. She is president of her sorority and would go to lots of fraternity parties and mixers on weekends. Most nights her location showed she made it back home. Other nights she would sleep downtown were the parties where. I bought up my concern to her once. She said she slept at her roommates cousins Johnny's house. I joked saying did You sleep on the couch and she got mad at me saying she needed space for the rest of the day. I didn’t ask her again when she slept downtown because I didn’t wanna anger her more. Another night she posted a Snapchat story of her kissing a guy on the cheek. This upset me I told her to take it down. She told me she wanted space again and called me controlling. One night I was facetiming her late at night and one of her ex-boyfriends Matt V hits her up to have sex and come over. I tell her to tell him she is dating me and to tell him to get lost. She's like I don't wanna be that girl who tells everyone I have a boyfriend and she told me not to worry she's done with him. Later one that night I check her location because I had my suspicions and she was not at her apartment. I checked she was at a upper class-man and grad student housing complex. I then call her and she didn't answer and she freaked out on me. She made up the excuse she was visiting her little sister who was having an anxiety attack and didn't wanna be at school . But I also had her sisters location on snap maps and she was at her freshman dorm .35 miles away when I calculated the distance on google maps. My girlfriend Told me her ex boyfriend Matt V lived at another student housing complex on the other side of campus and I was acting crazy and didn't trust her. She got her sister to lie and tell me my girlfriend was visiting her at the dorm when she was really with Matt V. She wanted space from me for the next 3 days and didnt start talking to me again until I got her sister from the train on Long Island and took her home.

My girlfriend came home towards the end of September for her sisters boyfriends father party and it was clear going to back to school changed her alot. She felt like she was better and cooler than me in some way and was acting suspicious at the party. she went upstairs at one point and saw her taking selfies in the mirror. I grab her phone and saw that on her snapchat she was frequently sending snaps to this guy George who I knew she had a thing with. She made up the excuse that he was gay and she didn't speak to me for the rest of the party. We had sex later on that night and she assured to me we were exclusive and I had nothing to worry about.

Around mid October I haven’t seen her in over almost month and asked if I could visit her. She said no she didn’t want me invading her life up there. Also she gave some B.S excuse that I probably didn't want her to visit me when I was in undergrad. She began throw a huge temper tantrum like a little child saying that I was replaceable and she would break up with me if I surprised her at Albany. I should’ve broke up with her then but didn’t because I loved her for so long and was going to see her on thanksgiving. And she said she was going to let me come up to formal at the end of the semester. (ENDS UP GOING TO FORMAL in DEC WITH ANOTHER GUY IN THE DRESS I BOUGHT HER LOL!!!.) At the beginning of November her sister who goes to the same school. Spoke to me about not liking school at Albany and she didn’t wanna go to date night later. I asked if her sister was going and she said no my GF(her sister) wasn't gonna be there. I was confused because my girlfriend in the weeks leading up to the formal/date night told me it was gonna be cancelled.

Later on that I got a Snapchat from my GF in a dress and make up which she probably didn't mean to send me. I asked her why she was all dressed up and she said to me don’t worry about it. I asked her if she was going to date night and she said it was a first date themed party. I then text her later on that night saying tell me the truth you are at date night with someone and she didn't respond. Her sister even told me she saw her there at the date night party. Them next day she texts me saying he appreciate everything I do for her but wanted to take things slow with me. Her excuse was she need to focus on school work. I asked if we were still exclusive but she said I shouldn’t worry. She gave some B.S excuse that she wants to get back with me and there is no time frame when we get back together.

I lost my mind because I felt like I did and sacrificed so much for her. The next steps I took were excessive but led me to find she was cheating on me. I DMed her ex boyfriend Garry from school on instagram on a whim. I did this because I had my suspicions. He told she didn’t say ever she was dating me and they had sex a few times together during the semester. Aslo during the summer she went over his house every Thursday while she was suppose to be at work.( I didn't know because I worked in the city in the summer during the week) While she was at his house he asked her about me and said I was just her family friend that had I crush on her but she had no feelings at all for me. He said when he dated her she cheated on him a bunch. He was able to prove it with a screenshot recording of her texting him to come over on our anniversary to come over at 3am and have sex. He said he also saw her with other guys walking home some nights. He also said they she has multiple guys in every frat there that she fucks. Aslo that her other ex boyfriend Matt V lived at the housing complex I saw her on her location that night not the other one she told me and he saw her car parked there multiple times. I also can't believe Her little sister was in on the lies too but I found out she was also cheated on her boyfriend from back home too. Aslo when my girlfriend dated Garry she cheated on him with the guy George she told me was gay. When I finally confronted her about it and showed her the texts she sent Garry with the dates and times showing her number. She went crazy and denied everything saying now there was 0 chance of us getting back together in the future and how dare I reach out to Garry. I also reached out to other people at her school and they all told me she said I wasn't her boyfriend when they asked just a family friend from home and they saw her hooking up with multiple people.

When her mom called me I told her everything about her daughter cheating on me she didn’t believe it. She wanted us to meet over the winter break and talk things out and be friends for now because our families are very close. I’m just very hurt because I never loved anyone like her for so long. I still have some feelings for her because I loved her for many years. Also i'm not gonna lie she is very physically attractive and the sex was amazing(usually it is with the crazy ones lol) I dont think ill ever get and one better than her. But all my friends and close family say she is no good and I must cut her out of my life for good. Part of me wants me to go to her house and start yelling like crazy at her calling her derogatory names asky why she cheated. I'm just so upset because I Loved her for years and how could she do this to me I just want answer why she cheated on me.

**tl;dr: Girlfriend cheated on me while at school and broke up with me I feel so hurt and confused about what happened. I know her and I are done forever even as just family friends but I don't know why but I am still obsessed with her and can't move on I just wanna yell and scream at her feel like I didn't get any closure.**"
depression,2019/02/11,"I (34M) don't feel anything for my wife (34F) anymore.  We've been married 12 years in March, have 2 kids and have gone from broke college students to relatively well off. She's a full time SAHM, but stays super busy with lots of community involvement (some kid-related, some not). She is a very nice and well-intentioned person. She's kind to her friends, generous. She's a good mom, too.

I'm miserable from depression, work woes, my parents' situation, etc. Recently (in the last year) I've left our shared faith due to a number of building circumstances that have rendered me faithless. She was on the couch crying yesterday (I don't know for what reason) and I just didn't care. I didn't try to comfort her, and basically ignored it. This definitely wasn't the first time.  I'm heartless, and I don't know why. I feel repulsed when I get a tiny notion to try harder. I am not mean or nasty to her...I'm just take up space.  She craves physical attention, but I just don't want to give her that.  I feel this pulling away feeling every time it comes up.

I know I'm the asshole here, and I'm not sure what I should do. I love my kids and I pour all my energy into being a good dad--but there's really nothing left for her. We disagree on a lot of topics, our intimacy is dead, and I'm just....blah. She deserves someone better than me. I think the right choice is to leave her, but I just can't find the strength of will to do anything about it. Maybe I just like being miserable.

I'm on some new meds (in the last 3 months) and I see a psychiatrist for my depression--I'm not naive enough to think this isn't interconnected, so maybe I need to talk to her again soon. I tried to call for an appointment and left a message because no one answered. It was really discouraging.

Today I hoped I would get in a car accident and die. Then the kids would grow up with fond memories of me before they get old enough to realize I'm not a great person. My wife would be able to remarry someone better, and I'd be done and dusted.  I'm too much of a coward to actually make it happen, but it sure would be nice to have an easy way out of all this."
depression,2019/09/20,Another weekend alone 15M about to turn 16 monday and i feel so fucking lonely. I’m homeschooled so i have absolutely no friends and live close to a high school and can hear the friday night football games every friday night. God it hurts so bad I just wish I had friends to spend my weekends with so much
depression,2019/09/20,"I worked my ass off to get here, and I'm not happy. I(19M) started off my college career at a small private liberal arts college in the middle of nowhere. I made some great friends and I still keep in touch with one of them to this day. I guess I felt like I was still in high school at such a small campus, the gossip and seeing the same people everyday. My situation there wasn't ideal but I was happy; I just wished I realized it then. After a semester I transferred to community college and got the best grades so I can apply to a big state college. Long story short, after many all-nighters and essays, I got in. I was finally going to go to a good University that people actually know of, go to a ton of parties, and make so many new friends. And most importantly, get that damned degree to make my family proud; but not myself proud.

So here I am at this big state college; I live off campus with two other guys I hardly know. I can't live on campus because there isn't any space. It's just so hard to make friends; I have to constantly rely on my roommates to go to parties and meet people; and it's evident that they aren't really fond of my anyways. I spend so much time in my room doing nothing because everyone on campus seems like they are so preoccupied with their own friends and their own goals. I've never felt so lonely in life until now. It seems so simple but it's hard to just walk up to someone and just talk to them. I even went to the club fair and I tried to make conversation with a few of the clubs and they just didn't seem to want to talk to me. Whenever I try and talk to someone nowadays I feel like I'm being intrusive or annoying. It's tempting to not try anymore. Yesterday I dressed up nicely and left my apartment to try and see if I could make a friend or two but I ended up just sitting on a bench, staring out into space, for like 3 hours.

I worked so hard to be at this great university and it's not what I thought it would be. In the end, I'm in college to get a diploma because that's what is expected of me. Which is fine, as long as I get to have fun in between; but I'm not having any fun. Going to class is hell because the what ever the Professor says just sounds like noise; I've even skipped class a few times. Every word I read from a book looks like scribbles. I just wish I knew how happy I was at the small private college; maybe I wouldn't have gotten a great education there, but at least I wasn't alone."
depression,2019/09/20,"Looking for advice to give my struggling little brother? Hi all,

Sadly my (22F) little brother (19M) has been having a really hard time of it, to the point where he’s left his second year of university and is currently staying with my older brother in another city. His anxieties started from a deep unhappiness with his “path”, in terms of not feeling like he has close friends there, that his hard work isn’t paying off, his program isn’t fulfilling, crippling self doubt that’s so uncharacteristic, coupled with a recent bad conflict / split with an on-again, off-again girlfriend. His symptoms include a complete inability to think rationally (he sends me long rambling philosophical texts at 3am), and because he can’t switch his brain off and focus, he zones out frequently like the lights are on but no one is home. He also can’t sleep, and most recently has begun hallucinating and genuinely just exhibiting the kind of scary behaviour that points to a psychotic episode. 

Obviously not looking for a diagnoses here, but it looks like he’s going to sit this semester out. My parents are flying from another country to come see him, get him treated, then bring him home. We will all be together as of tomorrow. 

My question is, how would you like to be supported if this were you? He knows my whole family knows what’s going on and has mobilized to help him because we love him so much, but I haven’t yet had the chance to really talk to him. I don’t want to downplay or belittle how he feels, but I also don’t want to make a huge deal of it and freak him out more. I’ve also had my own struggles (a therapist once suggested I was bipolar, but I don’t really believe this as I think I just went through an isolated incident of a particularly rough patch) but I feel like sharing my stuff could be unhelpful - I don’t want him to think that I’m dismissing this as run of the mill or normal, and that he’ll get over it eventually. Do I encourage him to do things that I know would help (ie we used to run together and he has stopped being physically active) or is it better to not push? Would he rather I act normal or acknowledge what’s going on?

TL;DR brothers going through an episode and need tips on how to best support him &lt;3"
depression,2019/09/20,"My GF (25F) broke up with me (25M) a week before I uprooted my life and moved an hour and a half from everyone close to me She broke up with me for being an asshole to her and our lives revolving around each other which they did. We try talking again and it was going well but I just wanted to be exclusive while we were trying to make it work and she wasn’t for it. She says she has fomo. 

She broke up with me a week before we were moving an hour 20 away from everyone close to me and my job. Now I’m stuck in this lease, right next to where she lives now and everyone she knows. So she’s living it up while I have to drive an hour and a half to go out. We lived together for almost 3 years

I really just thought I was gonna marry this girl and that was that but now it’s completely flipped. I’m a good looking guy but I’m just scared I’ll never find that connection again. I’m scared of waiting around for her as well but I’m just having a tough time moving on. It’s been a couple months 

She was honestly perfect throughout the relationship until the end, and it just fucks with me that I ruined it. I’m just really scared I’ll never get over it and never find love like that again. Are these normal thoughts? Will they go away? How do people deal with being with people for 20 years and then divorce? Feel like I would just wanna die at that point 

I’m in a dark place, and thinking about doing something drastic like moving across the country or something but I’m fucking stuck here for 2 years. 

Right now I’m on the verge of breaking down and just want to ask her to hangout because she helped me so much when I had low points in the relationship. I know she would still be there for me if I told her I needed her right now but Idk if that’s a good idea or not. I just can’t take it right now 

Hate my life right now, hopefully it’ll get better"

depression,2019/01/08,"Story of my miserable life  So, to start this off I'm 18M and the formatting probably sucks because  I'm on my phone so I apologize in advance. I'm just trying to tell my  story in hopes it will connect with someone and they can share their  similar situations. I'll start it off when I was 8. I was a quite niave  lad. Young and dumb I suppose. But one day my life had changed forever. I  was in the basement of my grandmother's house (me and my mom lived  there most of my childhood.) I heard a bunch of noises coming from  upstairs so I ran up there. I didnt really know what to expect. When I  got to the top of the stairs my uncle and my grandmother were sitting at  the dinner table crying. My uncle ran and picked me up once he seen me  and held me in the arms. He pulled me close to him and said ""I'm so  sorry OP, your mother passed away."" I was shocked, but for some reason I  didnt cry. I just held all of my emotions back and I felt nothing.  Still today I dont know why, maybe because I didnt fully comprehend what  was happening. Later on In my life I found out that she had killed  herself. I always had a thought in the back of my head that it was me  and it kinda never left me. Anyways, fast forward a couple years to when  I'm 13. I had been staying with my grandmother (my dad wasnt around  most of my life). She had gotten to quite an old age and her mind was  slowing fading. My dad came in from wherever, probably the third time I  had ever seen him, and decided to stay with us. He noticed my  grandmothers behavior and said it wasnt normal (her waking me up at 2am  saying it was time for school). My dad took me out of the house and I  moved in with his sister. His sister was a straight up b. My grandmother  had saved 15000 dollars for me from my SSI money and was saving it to  get me a car, when she got her greedy ass hands on it she bought herself  a new car. It wasnt till I was 15 that i understood what was going on.  They had sold my playstation while I was gone and said they had no idea  where it was. Once i seen how greedy they were i left and went to go  back and live with my grandmother. Her Alzheimer's disease has  tremendously increased since I was 13. She cried Every night after I  left. Which ultimately sent her Farther and farther down into the  disease. When I got back to her house she did not even recognize me. I  was so depressed because I felt like it was all my fault from where I  left. I still do. No I got back though my other aunt was living with her  taking care of her. She passed away in the later years, she was  bedridden from a stroke and slowly drifted away. I was depressed for a  long time over this and still am today. I always think that if I would  have stayed I would have prevented her downfall. I stayed with my aunt  till I was 18. I thought she was different but she wasn't. She said she  was saving up my SSI for when I moved out. Little did I know she was  using it for 500$ hair extensions and what not. Well I met this girl  when I was 17. She was absolutely stunning. She was weird, funny, smart,  and such a philosophical thinker. My aunt hated her. The reason why is  because she was noticing how much my family fucked me over. The house I  was staying in was supposed to be mine but my aunt made my grandmother  when she had Alzheimer's to sign the house over to her. Slowly I started  to hate her more and more. Later that year I got a call from my family.  They kept telling me to give the phone to my aunt. They told her that  he had died and committed suicide in a car wreck, and not me. NOT HIS  OWN FUCKING SON. At this point my family was nothing but scum on the  earth. And it is truly sad to say that. Me and my aunt fought alot after  that. Everyday it was heated discussions about my girlfriend and me. So  I left. I packed my shit and I left. I went and lived with my  girlfriends parents for 6 months and they were more of a family to me  than my own. Now I'm here. I'm 18, living with my fiance( aka that weird  funny and beautiful girl from the story.) And we have a dog and 3 cats.  I love my life now. For awhile I wanted to kill myself but I put my  family in the past and started worrying about me. And later on down the  road I will have a child, and i will show him the affection i never got.  Sorry for the long post. I just had to get it off my chest. "
depression,2019/03/13,"What now? So, starting off I want to say I have drank today. So I am sorry for any misspellings or wrong use of puncuation. I'm not sure how to start this post, but I guess I'll give you a short summary and then tell you my present predicament. So I'm a 23M year old currently, I believe my problems start when I was 8 years old. I do not wish to go into extreme details, but I was pretty much on my own since then. I had a mother, but I had a very large family and I was pretty much ignored by my family for some reason I still don't understand today. I could do whatever I wanted and there was zero consequences. I ran away one time and noone either cared, or noticed, not sure which. We moved around very often also, so friendships did not last long. To this day I cannot develop a relationship with anyone. This post is already getting extremely long so I'm going to cut out a lot more. But flash forward to today, I'm a veteran with no friends, family, or a single person who cares about me. I pushed them all out long ago. So here I am, can't remember the last time I was sober. I saved up a lot of money, then quit my job. And I've been drunk since. I've been planning on killing myself, but I can't decide when (I already know how). Until I watched a YouTube video today that actually put emotion into me for the first time since I can remember. Emotions are nice, I actually felt like a human for the first time since I was a kid. So, what now? I'm a depressed, anxiety ridden asshole, who no longer wants to die. But what now? I don't have the initiative to go to therapy or see a doctor for medication. I have noone to go to for support. So, what now?"
depression,2019/03/13,"Life journey after suicide attempt So I am 25M.
I've never used reddit before, but I thought maybe, if I just write my thoughts down, I might feel better or w.e

I've been moving around a lot since like middle school, so it had been longtime since I had actual genuine friends that would actually care for me.

Now, I've had depression for longtime and also tried to hang my self once but it wasn't successful.
I was never a true happy soul, but you know, like Robin Williams, I guess, I normally seem silly and happy outside but truly, I've been rotting inside. 

I feel like, no, I mean to say, in fact, I have nobody to talk to. I always had been alone pretty much.
Family ? Oh please, they had been a huge factor of my mental illness.

There was a person, who I talked for like an year, then I got into a relationship with her about 6 months ago. We had goods and bads, she was the only person I could lean to, and pretty much only one I could communicate about my everything and anything. 

Long story short tho, she broke up with me like a week ago, idk if she will change her mind or not, that's up to God, really.

I've been trying not to be extra depressed and get affected by it so much. However, now, just like before, I got nobody to even communicate and go thru day to day.
I tried to go out, like watching movies, dinner and etc...
I find it super pathetic I'm doing all these activities alone...
My story is prolly like everywhere, I'm just writing it down as it pops in my mind.
Thank you if any of you read I guess

depression,2019/03/13,"Confession: I stopped taking my meds and started taking shrooms instead Title says it all, stopped taking lexapro and am now microdosing with shrooms, my parents think I'm still taking the prescription meds. Lol @ them, because idc how depressed I am, I still want my dick to work. (18M)"
depression,2019/03/13,"26M Drifting Through Life I grew up as a Jehovah Witness, left when I was 19. I was robbed of a normal education, and a normal upbringing. I got hit with a double whammy with a shitty judgemental family that just lived life to make it to their paradise, no extracurriculars, no aspirations, just live enough to get by.

I hate the word Jehovah Witness, I'm sick of my past still having an affect on my life. I feel like I'm branded for life. I try to forget and move on, but there is always something to remind me whether it be a family talking at a restaurant, Christmas, Facebook posts, and so on.

So 7 months ago I left college and moved out of state. I ended up getting a full-time cushy office job rather quickly, I had a new up and coming perfect credit score, and new car. I was still depressed, but at least I didn't have money troubles. I went back to my original college but now I'm sure I hate college, I no longer care about a second degree, Computer Science. I have no more motivation and at most see myself as a hobbyist programmer. I left college the first time due to depression. I took the risk of going back thinking I would find a job quickly like I did before, thinking this time I would be motivated and I had my depression under control.

I feel like an alien in college. It's not normal to be a loner in college, I see so many groups of friends, men and women, going out and doing stuff, having parties, while here I am with a lot of acquaintances, but no real friends.

I've never had a girlfriend and have only dated girls off online apps. My sex life is non-existent, just lost my virginity at 25 through Tinder. People are dating and having sex on a regular basis, while here I am still in awe I met a girl at a club, made out, and hung out for awhile.

I don't have close friends, I find investing in people very difficult. I have definitely tried to make friends, but things always fizzle.

I honestly am not sure how I can recover from this. I feel like a loser as I should have my shit together by 26, right? I'm 50k in debt, 30k student loans and 20k car. I'm going to be legit street homeless after this semester unless I can actually get a job from one of the 100+ applications I've sent out into the black void. I hold an Associates in IT, but it doesn't seem to help much. My car will end up being repossessed in the near future, and my credit will be in the shitter.

Has anyone else dealt with drifting through life at my age?"
depression,2019/03/13,"finally decided to post this hi r/depression

this is my second draft of this post as the first one got WAY too personal and i rambled on way too much (not like anyone would read it anyways)

basically a lot of shits happening with my family rn and its having a big negative impact on me. for context im 15M, only child, suffered with depression basically my entire life, always was a bit overweight and very conscious about it, tried my hardest to lose weight, nothing worked and i only seemed to gain it so now ive just accepted it

ive started to neglect schoolwork to do things that make me happier in the short term

i know its not sustainable but its sure as hell feels a lot better

ive hoped things will get better but no matter what it seems life finds a way to fuck me over even more

ive had suicidal thoughts on and off for awhile now but im not really having those rn so not really seeking support on that front

what i want more than anything is to find someone to talk to

feel free to pm if you want more detail on any of this, it gets a bit too personal for me to share publicly

ive decided that if i dont reach out now, i never will."
depression,2019/07/08,"Does therapy even help? Im 18M and ive been depressed since childhood and it has gotten so fucked up lately. Ive tried therapy four times and each time one session only and then cancelled it cuz i felt it was worthless.

How can it helo me if i constantly think im the most useless garbage on earth and want to die? As they say you wont change if you dont want to.

Ive also tried 2 months of medication but it didnt help aswell.

I want something to ease the pain, but sometimes i think that death is the ultimate cure, and when i think i about that every other cure/method of easing the pain seems useless.

So people who have gone to therapy, on a scale of 1 to 10 how helpful was it?

I feel like im just gonna waste my parents money and my time (wow so usefull time) by doing it, same way i feel about every activity so thats why i lay on my bed 24 7."

CW/TW: Explicit mentions of suicide and methods

Throwaway because my friends use reddit and they don't know how severe my condition is

I  don't know what to call the feeling that I'm experiencing, but it's not  something new. For the longest time I've wanted to put a gun in my  mouth and pull the trigger with the intention of death but miraculously  survive with no serious damage to my health or function. I want to slit  my wrists and then wake up in hospital where they'll tell me that I'll  make a full recovery and I'm lucky I was found so soon. I want to  swallow a load of pills but have someone find me just soon enough so I  can have them medically pumped from my system and pull through.

I don't know if I crave for this as some elaborate cry for help, wanting my peers to see that ""I am *this*  damaged"", but I don't want them to do anything. I don't feel even the  slightest bit comfortable putting my problems on other people, and most  times when I have mustered up the courage to do that they didn't know  how to respond. Maybe I want this as a wake-up call, much like the  stories of the people who have jumped from bridges and before they hit  the ground/water realised ""I've made a mistake"", that I will carry out  the act with intent of death and wake up thinking ""Why in the world  would I do that?"". Then after my post-event-epiphany I make a miraculous  recovery and never battle with my mental health again because I  appreciate life more.

I've never made a  post like this before, I never reach out for help, I never try to make  it better for myself. With this post I'm just trying to see if someone  here can explain to me what it is that I'm feeling, or maybe you feel  the same and have some insight that I might not.

depression,2019/07/08,"Anyone here feels they have no real reason to feel depressed? 35M here, in overall terms I have had an easy life. I was born in a first world country. My parents never failed to provide anything for me or my sisters. Maybe I did not get from them all the love I should, but I was never mistreated in any way. I was a healthy kid, and I believe had a happy infancy. When I was a teenager the anxiety-depression started to appear but even though I was still able to live a relatively functional and happy life as a young adult (with the help of SSRIs).

I spend a lot of time by myself because it’s easy to do and yeah when I’m with people it boosts my spirits a little bit but I’m immediately shot back down and can’t think of anything other than how I want to drive 130mph into oncoming traffic. I feel like nothing in my world is going right.  I’ve always been smart but recently I’ve struggled and I’m worried I won’t get into a good college and my parents will be disappointed in me and on top of that my girlfriend dumped for my best friend and neither of them told me about it.  I have a paranoid suspicion that none of my friends actually like me and I’m just a lonely fuck with people who pity me.  I just want so much to give up. I’ve lost hope and I’ve been stuck in a rut for about 2-3 years and I don’t know what to do. I went to therapy for a while and I fell like none of it helped. I’m terrified of confrontation and whenever my parents or therapist ask me what I’m really feeling I choke up and I can’t say any of this. 
That’s why I’ve come to this sub. I don’t have a reason to keep going and I just want to end it because I can’t take it. I can’t take not being able to open up to anyone and whenever I try to get help it backfires and I just make myself even more depressed because I feel like a failure not being able to use the resources for help that I’m given.

depression,2019/06/13,"Struggling with depression, fiancé (37M) broke up with me (30F) because I've put him trough too much. I am writing this totally devastated, I know I put myself in this position, I know logically that I made the choices that ended up my relationship with the person I love the most in the world.  


 Why does it feel like every time I make the wrong choice I am on the passenger seat? Why I cannot get control of myself and make the right choices? Why is it so damn hard to get up on time? Why is it so hard to be mindful? Why is so hard to be productive and driven?  
I have promised him I was going to work on it and I tried, but failed every time and he doesn't deserve to be treated that way. He didn't deserved to go through all of that, I made him go through that and he still loved me. I fucked up once again and again and he will talk to me and we will figure it out, and he will be supportive, and then I would relapse again and convince myself It wasn't a big deal because I will keep working on it. It was a big deal, it was the last straw, I lied to him about something  I thought innocuous but I've had fractured his trust to the point he doesn't believe me or wants anything to do with me anymore. We had the house we were gonna live in, I had ruined that house for him, he hates the home we had plans of building, he told me he hates me now, I have made the person who loved me the most hate me.   
I am sick, I am a bad person, I have made all this choices and I deserve all that rejection.  


I don't want to end our relationship because I love him more than anything but I have failed to show up for him and he deserves better than me. I have no idea how to process anything right now, I am having a meltdown. I am not close to friends and family and neither is he. I  allowed my depression to take hold of my life, to the point of losing the most important person to me. I can't see anything in front of me anymore, I don't know how to deal with anything right now."

depression,2019/04/22,"Bf is depressed, getting worse everyday, refuses to get help  Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but point me to another if so. Throwaway account. Tl;dr at the end. English is not my first language, but I think you will understand me.

My (24F) bf (26M) and I have been together for 3 years now. He is a wonderful, calm, handsome, funny and smart person - full jackpot if you ask me. Since the day we met, he always had that gloomy, sad vibe to him, but you know, I just found it mysterious and interesting.

We've been dating for a few months, everything was awesome, hanging out everyday, having awesome sex life, best friends in general. As the time went by, he was opening more and more about his past (very abusive childhood, was left alone at the very early age, money struggles, etc.) and he admitted to suffer from depression (he has been diagnosed by a professional), but not taking any medication or going to therapies. I noticed that he had some pretty bad days sometimes, when he would close himself in his apartment and wouldn't answer my calls, messages or door rings. Few days later, he would just appear out of nowhere like nothing happened and we would go on with our lives. I always tried to talk to him about it, but he always refused (he would even go home from our meeting if I was too pushy). But, it was happening about once in two months and after that we could function normally. I guessed he just needed some time alone sometimes to clear his head and relax.

After a year or so, those periods become more frequent - like twice a month. Our relationship was still the same, love birds, but had sex only once in a month. Tried to talk to him, but refused and blamed it on stress. Things were getting worse, but he stopped closing himself in and instead just started telling me he feels ""bad"" or ""very bad"". I tried to take most of his daily tasks off of his back (like cooking, making appointments, paying bills, etc.) so he would feel less stressed about daily life.

Now, after 3 years since we met, we barely talk about anything about him - only about movies, reddit, events, people we know etc. When we're not together, we don't talk at all. Not responding to my messages, calls or anything. Just an occasional ""I feel very bad"". Last time we had sex was 7 months ago, and before that, we had sex 3-4 times last year (not that it's the most important thing, but you know...I noticed it). For months now, I've been trying to gently guide him towards therapy, or GP doctor, just to check if everything is alright or if there is any solution to his problems. But he just brushes it off by saying ""I hate talking and it doesn't help, I tried"". Past couple of weeks I've tried a more aggressive way - saying I will make his doctor's appointment, go with him or anything, he just has to get up and put his shoes on. No. Today his only message to me was ""I don't expect it to get better, just give up"". We barely meet (once a week, in the contrary of meeting every day before), talk even less, because he just lays in his bed every day after work. I tried to give him some space, but he would just ignore me for a week and then send me ""don't you love me anymore?"", so I guess that's not what he wants.

He doesn't have anybody but me. No family or close friends. What should I do? How can I show him that there is a solution to his worries and feelings, but I need his cooperation? I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, too, so I tried to talk to him from my personal experience (medications changed my life, therapy not so much), but he thinks I'm not ""that"" depressed as he is.

Tl:dr - bf is severely depressed, but refuses any medical help because it ""doesn't help"". Things are getting critical. How can I ""push"" him towards getting professional help?"
depression,2019/04/22,"Depression has ruined me I’m 18M that has had depression for over 7 years. I have spent this last week really analyzing my life over these 7 years and started to put things together. Being depressed makes me appear less friendly and always seem out of it which is why it’s hard for me to meet people. I’ve tried putting up a facade but it just adds too much pressure. I’m now really apathetic, I truly just don’t give a fuck about anything. This just makes things worse because I no longer care about my grades and the only reason to get good grades is so my parents don’t kick me out. I don’t see a positive future ahead of me, I have no hope for my future what so ever.  Being bullied throughout middle and high school as been the main contributor to my personality.  I don’t want to be around people because I have no idea how they will treat me, it’s given me a reputation and everyone seems to stay away from me.  This might be weird but I don’t see my self having a spouse/partner or anything. I’ve been attracted to women and there’s never been a doubt that I haven’t but all of my peers just talk about how they want to do this and that (sex and what not) but I just have no interest in any of that.  I just see myself always being alone. The worse thing about all of this is that I feel uncomfortable everywhere I go outside of my room. Walking on campus just makes my skin crawl, the feeling of insecurity and always thinking what someone might think/say. Even around my parents I get nervous and anxious and I can’t even look my parents in the eyes to talk to them cause it’s so uncomfortable.

depression,2019/09/17,"Am I really depressed? Please, help me. Please read this, I could really use some help right now.

I (17M) used to be an extremely happy, outgoing child, always full of life. Around 3 years ago, I became anorexic and obviously lost all of this. Throughout my weight gain, I was told that soon I would return to my normal self again. I did not. Around 6 months after recovering to a healthy weight, I realised that I was nothing like how I used to be. I had lost all of my confidence, enthusiasm and although there were a few good moments, life felt dull. After speaking to my therapist and a doctor, I was diagnosed with depression. None the less, I have always been in denial to myself about having depression.

Around 6 months ago I was prescribed mirtazapine however, I decided to stop taking it around 2 months in. Consequently, I experienced probably one of the saddest times in my life. Around a week ago, I started to take it again and suddenly I'm able to motivate myself, engage in social situations and most of all, joke around with my mum again. 

All this time I've been in denial about having depression but as soon as I took my medication, undeniable changes occured. Does this mean that I do have depression? Could I have been emotionless for so long due to anorexia that I've come to think that this grey world is normal? Or might I just be a guy who fetishizes my own sadness, only feeling different because of a placebo affect? 

Please, any advice/thoughts would be much appreciated ♥️"

depression,2019/08/26,"18M need advice 18 year old Asian male here (living in Canada), dropped out of highschool last year and need advice on what to do next.

I was an excellent student before and decided to apply to the US for college with the expectation that at least one of them would accept me. I didn’t only apply to ivy leagues knowing the competition was fierce and I needed to have some insurance. After being declined by all 11 of the colleges I applied for I dropped out of highschool. That was the most tiring 4 months of studying I’ve done and I felt like if my best effort couldn’t get me any results then there’s no fucking hope. I spent 3 months at home before summer started ignoring all help my classmates and teachers offered. I also watched some videos and did research on this and managed to convince myself that affirmative action fucked me over. During this time my parents were also in the middle of a divorce. I had to pretend to go to school and pretend to be happy during this time. 

My mom only recently found out this had happened and wants me to go back to school and redo grade 12. She yelled at me for dropping out and was confused as why I did so. She doesn’t understand why I would be depressed and says that she had it tougher when she was younger. She told me that the reason I didn’t get into a US college was because I’m just not good enough and that she knew from the start that I wouldn’t be accepted. I got mad and accused her of lying and misleading me as she told me before that I would definitely at least get one offer.

I contacted my guidance counselor and he suggests that I should try online courses as I am clearly not happy with school. I’m fine with taking online courses and I should be happier taking them than going back to school. I feel like I should be able to finish the online course much faster and with a higher mark than if I were stuck in school. My mom does not trust online courses and will kick me out of the house if I take them and do not return to school. 

I have told her that I am dealing with depression and that I’ve thought about suicide and her response was to go ahead. She says I don’t have the balls to do such a thing. 

I need advice on what I should do next. I’m tired of going to school I feel like all my hard work is pointless and that somehow I will get screwed again."

But basically it was really really bad last year, but this year it has gotten way better but its definitely still there.

First of all I'm 18M now and I still dont think I really look like an adult or close too one. Reason being I think I'm too short for one even though my height is actually ok, its 5'6, so not bad and I may be still growing. And also I always thought my hair and clothes looked bad so I decided to learn how to match clothes better and properly style hair. I workout more and it helps but for some reason I still think no matter what I look just too young and not good enough. Even though deep down I think I actually look pretty good but my head is much louder then my heart. 

Because of this I always have the urge to look in the mirror all the time which wastes time and impacts my grades. But when I look at the mirror I'm determined i still look bad and waste even more time in there. I find myself comparing me to other guys and such which I've tried to end. I get very anxious but it's weird because sometimes i dont feel anything and i can talk and such fine and other times i fell awkward and not good enough. My conditions are very random and some days I may never be upset until someone says one little bad thing or does something bad to me. 

What also sucks is I've never actually had a gf which I long for and I feel like none of my friends actually are that close to me to begin with. I cant really explain it but I just feel very alone. And when I think about what to do after high school I get sadder because I think I may be even more alone. I dont really have a plan for college and a job yet and I dont even drive which makes me stress and kinda freakout. 

Earlier this year I felt much better because of the meds and felt like no matter what, I looked awesome and I'm amazing, no matter what. And that things will workout and all will be fine. Issue being the depression has seemed to spike up again as previously mentioned. I do have a best friend who I love very much. I have known her for 4+ years and we were so close and I always looked forward to seeing her. So I think she's pretty cute and kind and such so I eventually fell in love with her last year and told her my feelings.  Though I found out she liked someone else. Ever since then I was upset but it got better and we just kept fighting and argued. I'm not even sure why but I was upset at some choice she would make and would get pissed and wouldn't want to see her for some time. 

Though I think that broke our relationship as we are not as close as best friends anymore. For various reasons I have paid attention too I can just feel our relationship is basically no more. She wants to hang with other friends more, we dont take about personal stuff, we dont test anymore, she gets mad if I ask about her personal life, and she basically dosent seem to be excited to see me, but is around others. When I confronted her about this she said she dosent feel like anything is wrong, but I know for a fact it is. And it hurts tremendously. She also used to say nice things about my appearance and it was really uplifting but now I see her say my guy friends are cute whenever I'm with them, but she never says anything about me anymore. She dosent give me hugs and shows affection anymore. Sometimes I wish she would just hug me and say something nice like ""Your hair looks good today"" or something. But that seems like its over.

And the final issue is I have been wrestling for 9 years ever since my dad forced me into it in 3rd grade. Presently I cant stand wrestling anymore and cant even stand going into a gym during a tournament.  I'm so burnt out and such. I just dotn find it fun and I want some more free time as I feel like I always have so much to do. Though I feel like I cant leave because my parents say I have too and cant leave and that I'll regret it if I leave my final year. But honestly I dont think so as I'm just really depressed and alone feeling. Sometimes I only look forward to sleeping. 

Anyway that was all I wanted to say. Thanks to anyone for reading through this, I mostly just wanted to get this out. But if you can give any advice on anything, I would absolutely love it."
depression,2019/08/26,"I'm (39M) so incredibly lonely, scared, and hopeless It's been over two months since my wife (38F) ended our relationship. She was everything to me, my best and only real friend for 22 years. I miss her so much. I want to call and text her but... it's not that way anymore. She's seeing someone else right now, has feelings for somebody else, none for me, and I'm not emotionally stable.

We have 3 kids, the youngest is going to Pre-K all day this year. After I drop her off at school, I'm by myself until I pick her up 7 hours later.

I came home today, forced myself to eat a yogurt cup, and tried to go back to sleep. I slept in our small bedroom closet. It was dark and cramped but I felt safest there.

I got up an hour and a half ago because I didn't want my wife to come home to dirty dishes, unfolded laundry, and a messy house. I didn't want to disappoint her again. But I didn't do anything. I just read on my phone.

I tried calling my Dad, the only family I have besides my wife and kids, the only person I can talk to, but he didn't pick up. He lives 9 hours away so I can't even go see him. I thought about texting/talking to a neighbor friend but I've already imposed myself too much in the past few days. I don't want to scare them away.

I can't see my therapist until next week. I called my case manager to see if they could set me up with another in the mean time and they couldn't.

I haven't worked in over a year and a half and after talking with a lawyer, I won't ever be able to get a legal job again. I would even settle for a job at McDonald's making minimum wage at this point. Just anything to make me feel like I'm not a worthless burden on my family. That I can contribute something. That I'm a human being.

I've been having to ration my medications because I can't afford a full months supply at $30. I take a 10 day supply so I have $20 for food for us or gas.

I desperately need someone to hold me while I cry right now. I had an anxiety attack yesterday and I asked her to hold me. She did but I didn't want her to let me go.

I'm a 39 year old father of 3 and I need someone to sit with me and talk with me, hold me, care for me. I want my wife back so badly.

I don't even have the opportunity to throw myself into a job, save money, and build a new life past this one. I have to rely on my wife who isn't in love with me anymore. How long will this last? When will I lose my kids?

I've been thinking about suicide more and more. I don't want to hurt my kids that way though. That's the only thing that's keeping me alive. But how do I get out of this? I can't even support myself.

And I watch my wife leave almost every night now. She doesn't sleep at home anymore most of the week. The kids get to her and I'm falling apart.

I can't do this. Not by myself. I'm not strong enough for the kids and I won't put this on them.

How do I get out of this alive?"
depression,2019/07/18,"Fear of criticism I'm[29M] a home body type for the most part. While home by myself I've gotten pretty comfortable with who I am. But when I'm at work I tend to close up. Like I'm wound up tight. I ask myself why I can't just be me while I'm at work all the time. I notice how most everyone else just seems fine for the most part. Relaxed and just doing what they're supposed to do. But 90% of time I can't do that. I have my moments where I feel confident and okay with criticism but it never lasts more than a few minutes. It's to the point where I feel like it's really holding me back or I'm in my own way of greater things. But when I'm feeling really good it feels manic and I instantly force myself to dial it back for fear of judgement from others. 

I fear hanging out outside of work with the few friends I've made because I think they're going to think I'm crazy. Not the good sarcastic crazy either. It's all conflicting and frustrating. I don't want this to become part of who I am. A person who hides. A person driven by fear. It's exhausting."
depression,2019/07/18,"I reached the boiling point (please read) Actually, I (19M) hit the boling point almost a year ago and I cant fully let this moment go in my mind. This is a very shameful story for me, but I hope some of you can help me process some of it, becasue I still cant.

Ill try to make it as short as possible

One night me and a bunch of my buddies decided to do some shrooms. Being the big man I thought I was, I took 5g, which could be rookie numbers for some, but not for me with my fragile mind (and it was my first time). First few hours was great, then an old friend showed up to the house.

A little backstory. This friend, I considered my best friend for a time. Ive helped him through tough times and hes dealt with alot. But it was his legit pshyco gf that had him telling me he was at the point of ending it all (important later) but I helped him through it, and against my advice, they stayed together.

Back to the story. He showed up to the house we were all tripping at. At this point I hadnt seen him in months and even with acknowledging the shrooms, I felt like something was off. He lost alot of weight and looked like skin and bones. Later on everyone went somewhere else and me and him were playing a video game. He started talking to me about where his life was at, like general shit but he wasnt making it sound nice. My mind kept going back to when he was telling me he was at the end. ( The shrooms already were attacking me with a bad trip and ego death but this felt important to me. )

After awhile he said he was leaving to go see his other friend in a bit (at 1am, by himself). Right then, I thought my friend was going to kill himself. I know thats heavy, but thats all I could think. I didnt know what to do, I asked him to have his friend pick him up, he said no. I asked to see the texts and he said no. I started having mini breakdowns in front of everyone and was trying my best to get him to stay. Everyone kinda picked up on it. I knew I could look like an idiot but didnt want to take a chance. I told him what I thought, I literally chased him down the road. He said fine, Ill get my friend to pick me up, and he did. Everyone was outside. And once the car came in the drive way that was enough for me but the he said ""hey didnt you want to tell him something"" and hes friend said hes alright, and I hugged him (out of sheer relief) and went inside. I still think something wierd was going on.

I kind of put a damper on the night for everyone and I feel like I opened his baggage up in front of everyone. I feel bad, ashamed and embarassed and I still always think about this night. It was the start of a very depressing chapter in my life. someone just say something about it."

I'm 25M and I don't remember ever feeling encouraged to actually talk more every time I hear it. Funny how the line backfires like that, at least to me."

I've tried medication and therapy. I feel the only way anything will change is if my life changes, but I'm completely out of ideas. There are no more interests for me to latch onto anymore.

It's not fair that they need help yet I'm the one who has to drown myself in meds and therapy just to be able to function from all the anxiety and depression. And now I can't even function anymore. I'm a medical student and trying to study for my first board exam, but no matter how much I try to calm myself down so I can get through my study schedule, I just sit staring into the corner numb. That just makes me feel even worse because I want to study so bad but nothing sticks.

We've only been talking for \~1 - 2 months and only really became a thing over the past week. This is the first time I've seen her like this and it worries the shit out of me. She's just listening to playlists on Spotify about wanting to die and being depressed and I really just want to help her but I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Copy and paste from my relationship advice post which hasn't had much response yet is below. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---

 

Hey, so the backstory is that I met this amazing girl online where we spoke for about a month before we finally met in person earlier this week and it was amazing -- I really like this girl, we just got along so well and had so much fun. Afterwards she let me know she had an amazing time and can't wait until the next time we meet.

However, as of yesterday she's been feeling depressed and sad and says she doesn't know why and I don't know what to do about it. I've let her know that I care for her and that I'm there for her but she doesn't really respond to that. She's also been a little more distant than normal. She's not the most affectionate girl in the world (which is absolutely fine because it's super adorable when she is, and, honestly, she was slowly becoming a little more affectionate over time, but it's completely gone now) but her responses have been more less frequent, and more cold and blunt than usual.

This morning we text for a while and she said she felt worse than yesterday but went on to play some games. I've been asking her to play games with me for a long time but she always somehow says no, but hell, I thought I'd try again and maybe if I could just do things with her it would make her happy or at least take her mind of whatever it is she's feeling down about. So, I asked, and she didn't reply. I told her it was fine if she didn't want to, again, she didn't reply and went back to playing her other game and then went offline and we haven't spoken since (only about an hour ago).

A part of me just feels like I'm annoying her by asking if she's okay (she never answered that text yesterday, either), telling her I'm there for her, and trying to do things with her. I genuinely do care about how she is and I'm doing these things because we're in a long distance relationship and I don't know how else I can help her.

The fact that I can't help her makes me honestly feel like shit and the way she's acting makes me feel like she may break up with me, but then, again, she said three days ago she can't wait for the next time so I think this may be my mind playing tricks on me.

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do? I've never been in a situation like this before."
depression,2019/03/10,"I [21M] would have killed myself if it weren't for the student loan debts as my family's financial condition is poor. I'm suffering from severe depression. I'm an introvert and have less number of friends. Was in a relationship for 3+ years, I had put in so much effort into it, but she left me 6 months ago, now she's in other relationship and I'm nightmares, sleepless nights, can't focus, can't work  properly, so basically there's no point in being alive .

depression,2018/11/20,"Breakdown 27M here. 

I dont know if this will make any sense and will be a wall of text but i need to write this down somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I think i've suffered from depression for the past maybe 10 years of my life, but due to being afraid (cultural norm), not having money (being so poor for one year that we barely had money for food), trying to recover from a natural disaster which set back everything i worked for years and literally being close to death and thinking for about 10 hours that i will die etc, never sought help for it. I've just went on in life on auto pilot without doing pretty much anything just sinking my time in games and movies, not being able to get a job partly because the pay was shit and partly because i was afraid.

About 3 years ago i moved from my country to somewhere else and got a decent paying job, but language is a bitch, in this 10 years i managed to lose all my friends, my close family is almost non existent (3 grandfathers dead, one of which i saw hanging from a pole at age 3-4), my father is an alcoholic and im not really on speaking terms with him, i love my mom a lot but i cannot drop more on her since she has to put up with my father (she is part of the reason i think i stayed behind for so long), and my surviving grandmother is sick due to being an alcoholic too, and probably wont live long anymore.

All was more or less ok for this 2-3 years until about 4-5 months ago when grandma got really sick and we though she will die soon, my father started drinking again a lot and threatening to harm/kill my mother and grandmother, i was getting close to my bday which is never a good day for me, i started drinking too much too, but met a girl on tinder who seemed really nice and supportive and to whom i managed to say more that i've said the last years and starting to open up, but then my father drank  really heavy and threatened to kill them again, and then i could not reach anyone by phone for two days and my mind assumed they were dead, and that feeling and everything just made me sink into a hole, and i started acting really shitty managing to fuck up with her too, to the point where she cut contact with me.

I considered suicide even before she cut contact with me, but when i really thought about it after that my grandfathers image came to mind, my mom and i started to get better for a while, dint drank anymore alcohol, started running, and even scheduled a doctors appointment which was a fucking month away. Month passed, the doctor agreed i was depressed and gave me the good news that im physically healthy, and sent me to a psychologist.   


The way things work here is i have to pay some of it (i could probably not afford it all by myself), and i have to look through a list and find one. Turns out all are at least months busy, and those that arent dont accept consultations in english, to the point where one of them dint even wanted to hear  what i was when i called and hanged up the phone.  


This was the last straw for me for now and for the first time i fell down on the floor in the shower and just broke down.

And since then i feel a fear has been instilled deep inside of me. Where i feel as though no matter how hard i try, i will never be happy and/or confident again. 

I mean, i finally found a passion in 2015 and i lost mt virginity. 2 very big things to me. And somehow from the heartbreak. Passion for anything seemed to just die.

How did i get here? Ive accomplished nothing since, ive failed uni consecutively with 3 attempts. Just can't focus or care enough. On my 2nd last attempt i fell for another girl and i got even worse.

I feel totally disconnected from everything and anything. I FEEL like im already Dead. And that makes me want to BE dead.. i feel so hopeless. I've lost alot. And I don't care about anyone elses feelings anymore. I'm selfish. Maybe because ive been punished for showing empathy pretty consistently. Maybe or maybe i wanna believe that.

I'm not sure I can come back from this again. Maybe I'm just broken now. I've tried to talk to girls. No luck. Just a couple dates. 

In 2015 i was connecting in a sexual way without even trying.

Idk i feel like this time. I'm unconsciously depressed.  Evidence around me shows me im doing worse. But i haven't thought I've gotten worse. All i like doing now is drugs. Mainly weed.

Never thought I could feel so sociopathic. Idc that i haven't spoke to my closest friend in like 2 weeks. 

I also am diagnosed with BPD Traits. Not everything apparently.
But yeah makes it hard to be alone. But at the same time i love it. Its like i love to punish myself.

Because i hate myself."
depression,2020/01/02,"My important friend had an accident since 2 months + has now amnesia from trauma and does not recognize me, which is difficult for me to accept. I \[20M\] have known my friend \[Nikol 21F\] since 5 years and help since i know her.

It's not really about me instead more about Nikol, but i would appreciate everyone's advice and support!

(also i'm not sure if this is the right community and honestly really don't know where to start the story, because it's way too bizarre to understand or believe it, but i'll try anyway)

Nikol was born with cancer, is allergic to the sun, has bad luck in life and is innocent since always, because her parents have never loved or cared about her, all they ever did was abuse mentally + physically and talk bad for no reason, her father is actually not really her father, because she had a blood test and the result was that her mother was with her ""uncle"", her younger brother stole her Nintendo Switch and never gave it back, she never got money support from her parents that she needed for school / university + not even lunch, the whole ""family"" are bunch of irresponsible rude people, the only good thing that Nikol had in life was her dear late Grandmother who took care of and raised her to be an honest, good and heartwarming person.

I always liked Nikol, because she is a wonderful, interesting, smart, etc. person and did everything I could to help so that she has a better life that she deserves like to help her mentally, gift her a good bed so that she no longer has back pain, laptop so that she has it for university, cell phone so that she does not become alone and can talk with me, switch so that she has fun, a rabbit that gives her joy, etc. etc. etc. I know it would sound like a scam at first sight, but for me it's not, because no one really got to know her that well, but i really know and talk to her almost everyday and that it's not a waste so i'm the one who helped out and bought all the stuff that she needed in life and that i really don't care about money or that she never would dare to ask me about doing all that in the first place, but it showed how grateful Nikol really is with tears of joy, because of my kindness. I also took good care (for a short time) of her late Grandmother, paid for a proper grave and promised her before that that i will take care of and protect Nikol so that she doesn't have to worry anymore which made her happy and feel at ease until the end.

Nikol should be happy and if she dies, then everything was for nothing and I really love her and want her to live so I only believe that I can help her and that she needs me, but now I just don't know where to start, Nikol was really (/always) depressed (because her life was already bad enough thanks to her family) + suicidal since the accident which was 2 months until the trauma amnesia started, now she can't recognize me anymore and it's really hard for me to accept the truth, so i would really appreciate everyone's help!

depression,2020/01/02,"I (21F) was doing better, my ex (23M) talked to me, and now i’m bad again. my ex and I were broken up and still living together for multiple reasons, but it got to the point where we didn’t even try to be friends anymore and we just didn’t interact at all. that went in for a few months, i spent a lot of time going out, with my friends, and making new friends and i realized i started improving. But just this past week, my ex started having conversation with me while we were packing so we could move out before the first (today). I knew we had to communicate but we didn’t have to joke around, update each other, and just interact the way we did. it was completely shocking, and i didn’t think it’d effect me so much, but it did. i love him so much, and talking to him like old times made me so incredibly happy but now i’m a mess. i feel like I’ve lost all the progress i made. he left on the morning of new year’s eve without saying goodbye. i went to work right after he left and figured he’d be home by the time i was out. but nope, he was gone, he changed his number too so when i tried to call him about some stuff he had left behind, i couldn’t reach him. this was all a big shock to me, i rang in the new year confused and in tears frantically packing and moving everything to my parents’. 
i don’t know what to do. i feel terrible, i feel like i’m slipping back to feeling the way i did before. i think him interacting with me the way he did made me feel like he wanted to try to be friends, i don’t know. i wish he had just left me alone if he had planned on leaving so abruptly."
depression,2020/01/03,"Successfull from the outside I (20M almost 21) am enrolled at a good university, i am certified in a well-paid domain and i am also a volunteer (for charities &amp; projects.

\- The university is constantly taking my hard-earned money because i am miserable at any subject that is not the niche mentioned above. My parents are also poor but because of good money management i grew up without feeling it as much as i do now.

\- I am self conscious because of teeth problems &amp; past bullying. I intended to use the money that i've earned to solve the situation with the teeth but the university had other plans with me.

# I gave 100% but now i'm back to the square 0 ... with even more exams to pass because they stacked.

Even though i have friends from volunteering i don't feel so close with them in order to discuss personal matters.

I tried to give signs of depression to some people but they don't seem to notice because i am ""chill"", or ""a wonderful person"" or whatever they call me.

The thing is that sometimes i cannot sleep at night by how stressed i am. Not only i have those issues, i also face the pressure made by their expectations of me.

  
So, anyone with the same story ? How did it turned out for you?  
English is not my native language so sorry. Thank you!

depression,2020/01/03,"Consistent desire for disconnection - any tips? Hi r/depression,  


I (25M Australian) am posting due to my recent bout with my depression and this overwhelming feeling of disconnection - but I want to know what tips or methods have helped some of you so that I can do everything to beat this.  


Consistently no matter whether I'm with people, working, in a public place or at home by myself I'm always finding myself having this desire to just ignore everything around me and switch off; but not zoning out, more like this desire to disappear completely. The relationships I have with people, the work I do and the hobbies I try to explore conjure no feeling or meaning for me, they feel pointless.  


All I ever want is to get back into bed or have something in front of me I can focus 100% on to distract me from this feeling. This makes any steps I try to take in life so much harder and I'm just so tired of fighting myself all the time.  


Currently I have a psychologist that I see once every 2-3 months and I'm on 100mg of Sertraline. 

My goal for this post is to find out anything I haven't tried before that might aid me, I'm just feeling lost and thought maybe speaking to others whom have had similar experiences would be beneficial.  


Sorry if I sound desperate, but I'm at the point where I am."
depression,2020/01/03,"The difference between situational depression/adjustment disorder and the idea that “depression follows you everywhere” I am writing this post because of what I am currently experiencing. 

Quick stats; 19M, in college, working part-time at a machine shop, live with family, life is great from an outsiders viewpoint. 

And it should be great. I do well in college without trying too hard, I love my apprenticeship, I have some really cool hobbies and own some really nice things. Everybody tells me that I’ll amount to something great. I tend to think in a different way than most people (can elaborate on that, not bragging, sometimes it’s a disadvantage). 

If you didn’t guess already, I was a “gifted kid”. Maybe that’s what screwed me up. It seems that neither myself nor anyone I speak to can prove anything as the culprit. 

But my life isn’t great. About 85% of the day goes by relatively ok. But starting about a year ago (December 2018) I lost the ability to have hope and to deal with the other 15%. My hobbies (working on my old truck, shooting shotguns, collecting things, geocaching, etc) have become much less enjoyable. I’ll save the rest of the symptoms list, unfortunately you guys know all about them. But the main ones have been losing interest in good things, thinking about death way too much (but no plans for an early demise), and anticipating that my future life will be shit. That 15% is the part of the day where I encounter hardships and worry about my current and future life. 

I went to several therapists who did not seem to believe that I have clinical/major depression. There’s nothing to suggest it. Two of them believe that I could be labeled under “adjustment disorder,” which to my understanding roughly translates to situational depression in my situation. 

It’s situational as hell, that’s for sure. Here’s a basic version of what happens. I’ll use an analogy which has actually happened over two dozen times in the last six months. 

*I am working on a project in the garage. An expensive part or operation is somehow damaged or otherwise fails to work successfully.*
*I rightfully recognize that the damage will cost $500, which is two weeks pay. That’s two weeks of extra work, two weeks of grinding, two weeks without my prized truck.*
*I start thinking (instantly) about how badly I screwed up. About how I can’t even complete a simple task. About how big of a deal this is.*
*Then I realize that it’s my own fault. I chose to bow down to my parents and go to college, adding stress to my life. I chose to only be able to work part time. I chose to have limited funds and free time.*
And at that point I see life as boring, futile, and in some cases not worth living. 

And that’s a stupid example too. It can be anything. A screwup at work, a hard day at school, a traffic jam which results in missing something important to me, family reinforcing the idea that my life will suck in the future, etc. 

Basically something triggers it, always a failure or delay or hardship of some sore. I think way too much and spiral into a depressed state. And I stay there anywhere from an hour to almost the whole day. 

But it’s not there 24/7. Only when I feel unable to do something important, whether or not I’m at fault. Situational. 

And I hope that it improves. When I was in high school it was even worse. I had much less money and time. The things I do now were only dreams. I had so much hope for my future. I thought I would skip college, work for a few years, save up, buy a few acres, and build my ideal life literally by hand. 

If you can’t tell, I’m a bit of a redneck. I like working with my hands and building/fixing things. It can make and save you a lot of money. It could get me to where I want to be. 

I chose to live at home, go to college, not make enough money to fuel my needs and desires. And I can’t get out for two more years. I have a lot of hope, though, that after I am free from my shackles that I will have an easier and more enjoyable life. 

At this point, you can choose to ignore everything above and instead focus on my question,  ask me things about my situation, or offer advice. I’m mainly here for option A, but I thought I’d explain myself first. I can post some writings I’ve done that explain my situation and thought processes in greater detail. 

Hell, maybe I don’t even belong here. Maybe I’m a normal person who can’t get a grip on simple things. I’d still like to know. 

Obviously situational depression is just that, situational. In theory it subsides once the problem is over. 

I also hear this advice commonly echoed:
“____ won’t fix you.” ____ is usually travel, dating/sex, drugs (rightfully so), a new job, a new city”
“Wherever you go, there you are.”
“Depression follows you. You can’t run from it forever.”

Do these saying have any meaning to a situation like mine? What’s the difference between having hope/an end in sight (a goal which ends the perceived source of your problems) and wanting to (metaphorically) run away from your problems?

I hope that this community can provide some insight for me. I am thankful for any information or advice offered and wish everyone the best in their personal journeys through any type of depression or mental illness."
depression,2020/01/03,"Bf's depression is worsening - what can I do? Having to use a throwaway because he knows my actual Reddit username.

For a bit of background, my boyfriend (18M) has Asperger's Syndrome and has always had trouble with his emotions no matter how he felt. Over the years, there have been many improvements but if his mind isn't in the right state, the vulnerabilities start to show. Due to my personal circumstances, my boyfriend's family took me (18F) into their home last September.

He was diagnosed with depression last September and he was prescribed citalopram to help with his mood (he's had setrolin in the past and has reacted badly to it). However, his family and I have just discovered that he ran out of tablets weeks ago and had been refusing to take them when he did have them. At this point, red flags are going off because he's always been able to take his tablets when he needs to, even when he was first diagnosed. His mum managed to get an emergency prescription through and she's now going to be holding onto his tablets and give them to him daily like she does with me (I tried to OD last summer so I'm under strict instruction not to handle my own anti depressants). 

He's been missing a lot of classes because of it all and it's getting to the point where he's sleeping more than he's awake (last night he slept from 7am to 5pm, then 8pm to around half 11pm). It's really worrying me as well, he's given up on himself and just shuts himself away all of the time. He tried to barricade himself into his room yesterday, so his mum and I had to try and get him out (this is very much not like him). He also bit my finger, swore at me and tried to throw a packet of something at me (again, very much not like him, I'm guessing it was an autistic meltdown but whether the depression is contributing to the severity of them, I don't know). His family and I are worried that if he keeps going the way he is, he's going to self destruct.

I would like to ask for any sort of advice or ideas you give me to help him. If you could help me understand how much I can do, that'd be greatly appreciated. I'm autistic too, so trying to understand things from his point of view is slightly harder than it would be. Thanks in advance :)"
depression,2020/01/04,"Anyone on Zoloft (sertraline) and Abilify (aripiprazole)? 25M here. To make a long story short, the past few months have been absolutely brutal. I've been battling depression/anxiety for about five years now, and recently I found myself sliding back into a real dark place. I was severely depressed and my anxiety had started spiraling into paranoia (i.e. intrusive thoughts, not wanting to go out in public). I finally went for a medication adjustment. I had been taking 20mg of Lexapro (escitalopram) and felt like it wasn't doing anything for me. Doc put me on Zoloft, and I saw an initial boost, but found myself regressing again.

This past Monday, we upped the dosage of Zoloft to 150mg and added Abilify (2mg), and I must say I do feel a lot better. I'm relaxed, anxiety is way down, and my depression has stabilized. I am just curious if others have had similar experiences with this med combination."
depression,2020/01/04,"I feel depression coming back and I don’t know how to tell my girlfriend I (20M) have been dating my GF (20F) for 5 months and she’s made me the happiest I’ve ever been. I really love her. The problem is that I’m feeling what feels like a long term wave of depression coming back into my life and I don’t want her to think it’s her fault. She cares about me and is checking in more because she’s starting to sense something wrong and I can’t make myself bring it up with her. It just makes me feel like a burden even though I know she would not see me as a burden at all.
Anyone else deal with situations like this?"
depression,2020/01/04,"This has been killing me mentally. I don’t know what to do anymore. I'm a boy (17M). There's this girl (17F) in my grade. From September to Christmas, we were in the school Madrigal choir, but it ended right before Winter break. I started doing acts of courtesy every day (holding doors open, complimenting her, etc). She was very friendly and always initiated conversations with me (I'm very shy and an outcast, so this was so exciting for me). We have common interests and I really love everything about her. She even gave me a Christmas present and told me how happy she is that we met. Everything was going great until I got her number. I asked if she wanted to hang out some time and she said ""yeah maybe"". We haven't talked since. School has started again and she doesn't talk to me anymore. I spent the whole Winter break in my room depressed, overthinking everything, and wondering what's so bad about me/why nobody likes me. I have had a very hard life, struggling with my sexuality, crippling depression, suicidal thoughts, and severe anxiety. I thought that this girl was someone I could be great friends with, but my text obviously really scared her off. I found out that she thinks I like her. She doesn't like me in that way. I love her as a person, but I have no sexual attraction to women. I am getting so tired of spending every day just waiting for the next day, in hope that it might be a better day. This girl is all that's been on my mind lately. I have been losing sleep over this for weeks, I over-analyze every encounter we have. Seeing her at school was always the highlight of my day, and I look forward to seeing her at school every day. When she would talk to me at school, it was always the highlight of my day. Now she doesn't seem to acknowledge me anymore. I don't know if it's because she's going through a hard time or if she's just uncomfortable around me, but I care about her so much and don't want our friendship to end. If she knew what I go through/how I really feel, I think she would definitely become my friend. I always want to talk to her, but I get so scared and whenever she talks to me, I'm painfully awkward. There are many things I would like to say to her, but I get so scared of creeping her out that I just stay silent, but I think my silence also creeps her out. Should I move on? She made me feel wonderful (when she actually talked to me). I want her to know how important she is to me, but also explain that I don't want any form of relationship. I'm lonely, depressed, unpopular, unconfident, and longing for a close friendship. 
I need help."
depression,2020/01/05,"Feeling lower than ever after a 8 day high if anyone could read my story I'd appreciate it. So basically I have the worst years of my life for the last 3 years but I've also had the best highs ever.

Well I went on holiday away from my family to see my brother and other family I also gave up PMO for this time and since I was in a good environment it wasn't that hard to stop. Well anyway while I've been here and spending times with my brother I actually enjoy life and don't want it to end it all the time.

But the thing is this long lasted for 8 days and now I'm going to have to go back to my pathetic excuse of a life.

I don't like living like this and I don't want to.

depression,2020/01/05,"Never have been loved (romantically) and don’t think I ever will be I’m almost 30 (29M) and I have never been loved by someone else romantically. Already struggling with depression and anxiety for the last decade, being gay doesn’t help as it makes it so hard to find a partner. I see happy couples on twitter and Facebook and it always reminds me that I have never been loved.

I have so much love to give too but nobody ever wants it and definitely will not reciprocate. I’m just tired of being lonely, I wish I had just one person to hold me, tell me they have me and that I’m safe with them, that they love me and I’m important to them... but I’ve realized that is just a pipe dream.

depression,2020/01/05,"Can't stop thinking about killing myself, every night It's been like a year that I have this thoughts every night when I go to sleep. And I can't sleep because of that and many other overthinking stuff. I plan literally everything, have all the scenario in my mind, but I have never tried doing it because I'm scared. Because once it's done, it's over. I can imagine my family will be sad and I will be considered selfish and weak. Eventually, I fall asleep and sleep almost all day next day. And every night I know it will pass, I just try to stay calm and convince myself that tomorrow will be better. But it starts over...

24M here, hello everyone! Sorry if I am disturbing anyone. I just wanted to let it out, but since I don't have any friends, I had to do it here.

Also, a short story about me. (This is my first time writing on here.)  I am depressed mostly because I keep everything inside, who I am must stay a huge secret in this traditional and retrogressive society I live in. Also, talking about mental health is a big taboo here, so I can't even get a professional help nor talk to my parents who should be my first and biggest support. I was bullied as a kid (apparently it was my fault that I attracted bullies), I am different in many ways than the majority, and I know it sounds pathetic, but really no one understands me. People here, according to this mentality, must be all the same, like sheep follow the majority blindly. I am also gay. So there are many things I can't share with my parents and I can't have real friends. I think moving out of this country to a better place might be a solution, but I need a job to earn a lot of money to become independent from my parents. I actually hate money, it's not something we want, but we need it.

In a way, I understand why no one wants to hang out with me. The depression made me stop caring about myself, my looks, my hygiene. My teeth look horrible and I have a bad breath. I didn't shower in a week or so. I don't get out of my house (or just to buy cigarettes). When I search the internet, they all say do this do that (physical exercise, hobbies, socialize etc) but nobody tells you how to do it, how to even start doing anything. I would like to, but I just can't make myself moving.

Sorry for the long post. If you read it, thank you. You don't need to help me if you can't, I just feel a bit better letting it all out here. Stay strong, good people!"
depression,2020/01/05,"I don’t know what to do. (21M) Hello! 

Apologies in advance due to being on my phone and just trying to get these thoughts off before i forge (long read incoming)
 
I’m not here looking for pats on the back or empathy really, but more so answers. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety throughout my entire (short) life so far, and my entire life has been filled with sadness and emptiness. On top of that i come from a dysfunctional family where my father is out of the picture and my mother relies on my emotionally and financially. I left my home at 19 to join the military and create a life for myself and hopefully start over and find out who i am and what i am. I’ve always been referred to as a bright child, level headed, and determined. But I’ve never been able to see these qualities in myself. I’ve never experienced a period of happiness and am not sure what it’s like to live as a “functioning” human being. I wake up everyday with a genuine hatred for myself and the life i am living, going on as a zombie and coming home to reset and start over the next day. Despite this I take all the recommended steps to counter these feelings and state of mind. I spend my free time researching and discovering ways to better myself and relieve myself of some of the pain i deal with but to no avail. 

I have am in a LTR with my wonderful and successful girlfriend who’s on her way to having the world in her hands. I have my own apartment, a job that I hate but pays the bills at the end of the day even though i work an inhumane amount of hours, and I can pay my bills and have been able to afford a car. I take of my finances very well and have high credit and all of the other snazzy things. I also see a therapist and Psychiatrist which has diagnosed me with clinical depression and anxiety and am currently on my third bout of meds with Bupropion(300mg) and Buspar(20mg) though they do nothing. I exercise sort of regularly with the little free time I have and always try to remain efficient and maximize my free time, taking part time classes online and handling my responsibilities as a young adult now. Despite that I hate myself.  I hate looking at myself (haven’t looked in a mirror in months), i don’t know who I am and i spend the day driving myself crazy internally. Nothing seems to work for me and I’m tired of initiating paths and goals for them to fail and collapse in front of me. I took 5 classes at a university nearby this past fall while working and got into a car accident because i was just frankly doing way too much. But i just wanted to feel like I was doing something for myself. I try to eat a healthy diet and follow proper regimes but I can’t seem to get the results I want (and have wasted a lot of money throughout the process) and I honestly just don’t know what to do. I don’t know where I am, where I’m going, and what’s going to happen to me. I don’t have many “friends” and many do not know of me and my personal battles and struggles. I speak to my leadership for advice but it just doesn’t click. I feel alone and fading and I don’t have much to build off of in this New Year. To sum it up I’m just asking for assistance and Advice in what i can do/what routes to take to get better and maybe function and be content with my life one day. Any help is appreciated and if you’ve read all this i thank you. 

TLDR; High functioning depressed young male, proactive and willing to do the work to get better but nothing has worked to actually help me get better. Do not know what to do or where to go. Medicated, , in talk therapy, healthy eater, exercise moderately, and nothing seems to work."

What's the fucking point anymore? if I die no one will miss me. I'm just a fucking parasite to everyone I know. It's all my fault. I don't deserve to live anymore I'm only causing more stress to everybody around me. I just want to feel loved, appreciated and wanted for once in my sad excuse for a life."
depression,2020/01/06,"I (20M) am gonna come clean to my parents tonight about my struggles with depression and anxiety since the passing of my lifelong best friend last year. So March of last year, my first ever friend, the man I spent literally 19 years of my life with passed from Leukemia. This obviously had a major impact on me as he was always my rock to lean on when things got bad. And when I say we were best friends I mean we hung out almost every single day since the age of 3. We were born in the same hospital, on the same day, and that’s how our parents met (who also became best friends). After his death it felt like my whole world came crashing down, I developed crippling anxiety and depression. Which are all diagnosed, unbeknownst to my parents. Now the reason I haven’t told my parents about all of this is because well I’m kind of embarrassed. No one in my family really talks about their feelings that much, and when I tried my brothers or dad would usually play it off as a joke. I know it sounds really bad but I do have a loving family we just don’t really communicate our feelings like that. I’ve been secretly seeing a therapist for about 6 months now and he keeps urging me to be open about my problems with my family but I’ve just been so scared. I guess I came here to ask for advice on how to tell them without making it seem like they’ve done something wrong. I really need their support cause school is so hard for me when I’m baring all this pain and I want them to understand that I’m trying my hardest, some days I literally just can’t get myself out of bed tho. I am taking escitalopram (I think that’s how you spell it) and I think it’s helping a little but I’m really not sure. So if anyone has any advice on how to tell them without making them feel bad about it I’d gladly listen."
depression,2020/01/06,"How Would A Girl Ever Pick Me? I (22M) go throughout my life seeing all kinds of relationships and such interesting people find each other. I have friends that I hang out with and even in their weddings. Friends I understand and can see having, but when it comes to a relationship, I can't imagine a girl wanting to just be with me. I can't even picture in my head someone looking at me and just smile because she's with me, someone wanting to hold my hand walking down the street, someone that wants to fall asleep in my arms or someone that is waiting at home just for me. How in this world out of all these people would she pick me?"
depression,2020/01/06,"I've got no one to confide to, I just want to vent this all out. I don't know myself, I'm feeling lost and regretful that I missed out on my youth. I'm sorry if this is all over the place and won't make much sense, but I feel a sense of relief getting this out here. I've been waking everyday feeling there is a void in my chest.

I'm 22M, and I recently finished college and passed my licensure examinations last October. I am now at the point where my family expects me to get a job, get a girlfriend start a family etc. etc... and it fucking sucks... everybody seems to have moved forward, but I'm here wasting away... not even getting my shit together. I'm still having turmoils and clinging on to the regrets that I have deep down inside me.

I was never anyone's best friend. I never truly opened myself to anyone, even my family. Heck, I don't even know who myself truly is, because I never had a personality or ""self"" to begin with. I only wore ""masks"" and put up a facade and acted out ""personas"" that conformed to the expectations of those around me. 

At home, I acted out the persona of an obedient son, one who constantly helped out with housework and behaved well especially during family outings. When I was with the troublesome kids in high school, I wore the mask of an ""asshole student"", I broke school regulations, vandalised, ditched class, constantly sweared and talked trash, spread rumors and made fun of others. College came and I shifted my mask into ""diligent student"", and I consistently aced tests, and performed spectacularly academically. 

I polished this ""diligent college student"" mask so much, I did end up having remarkable grades and graduated with honor and awards. But that sums up my whole 5 years in college. Nothing spectacular happened. I was just a book smart asshole, and looking back I was ""that guy"" in class... The one kid who you don't even know belonged to the class, always sat alone in the corner seat, doesn't have someone for the ""find yourself a partner for the activity"" bullshits, never went out on parties, and practically never spoke to anyone about anything aside from schoolwork and academic stuff. College ended and I had to drop this mask, and I'm left with my blank self again.

I worn so many masks throughout my life, that I don't know my true self and personality anymore. Our family and relatives know me as the sweet obedient son who is very helpful and follows parents orders without fail. While people in high school know me as an asshole, and people in college knows me as the genius anti-social kid. There are times when people actually called me out for acting like a completely different person and ""out of character"", since I've only been showing them a mask of myself. 

Needless to say, this identity crisis maybe crippled my social life as nobody treated me as their ""friend"". Sure there were some acquaintances, but they all since drifted away and doesn't keep in touch anymore. I feel like I wasted away my youth, and I am never gonna experience it anymore. I'm longing for a best friend that I can visit unannounced. I missed out on having a tight knit circle, singing all throughout the night in a karaoke bar. I missed out on having friends that I can do shenanigans and banter with. I missed out on flirting with the opposite sex. I missed out on my youth."
depression,2020/01/06,"I [20M] feel like I'm wasting my life I don't know if I'm in the good subreddit because I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I have to talk about my situation somewhere and I chose this subreddit for lack of a better option.

I've been alone all my life. I'm an introvert and not really good at social interaction. I had about four friends in high school but we all went separate ways and I barely talk to them anymore. I've yet to make a friend in college due to my lack of social skills and my shyness. My only true friend in life is my brother, who's older than me. All good things come to an end eventually and things get more and more serious with his longtime girlfriend, so I'm not his top priority anymore. They're thinking about moving out, so I'll lose my closest friend (and one can say my only true friend) when they do. I come from a conservative family and we never talk about our feelings and we never did.

The Holidays were a reminder of my solitude. I spent New Year's Eve with my brother's friends because I don't have any friends on my own. All they talked about was sex and relationships. I've never had a relationship and never even kissed a girl, so I felt excluded and left early, spending New Year's Eve alone in my bed, crying. 

To come back to my lack of relationship, this is what makes me feel like I'm wasting my life. It's sad to say, but my brother's happiness makes me feel miserable. I feel like I'll never get to cherish the same thing he does and be alone for the rest of my life. I wouldn't consider myself attractive and I've never known anyone who was attracted to me, ever. I've tried all the dating apps imaginable, Tinder, Bumble, Fruitz, POF, Facebook, name it. I've never had a single match. It makes me feel miserable and I get the feeling like I'm going to die alone. 

Ever since the New Year's Eve episode, I feel a general sadness and I've lost my appetite. The things I previously enjoyed don't have the same effect on me. I feel like I'm drowning in my own sadness. 

I know some of you will suggest to me to go out and meet someone. I come from a small town where everyone knows each other, but I can't go to the city, because my conservative parents won't let me and I can't pretend like I'm hanging out with my friends, because I don't have any. 

I just want to find someone who will understand me and help me find my will to live again, but I don't see how it's possible. 

Help me Reddit, I'm begging you, I really need your help before something bad happens to me."

Been in a relationship  for about a year [25F, 26M]   We were kind of on and off because  of his depression  and his meds weren't  working for him. He was reluctant  to meeting up although  we talked some through  text.   I didn't leave though because  he would be sitting in his apartment  alone so I made sure  to text/call him at least  once a day.   Fastfoward a few months  and he's on new meds and were  back to seeing eachother and stuff.  He told me when he's with me he hasn't  been suicidal.  Things are okay for a little while until I stopped hearing  from him less and less.  Everyday he would send me lots of messages and he was happy.  I know  something's  wrong,  but I don't  know how to approach  it and he's denying or being quiet about it.  I called him but  hung up  during the conversation,  because  I was mad,  don't  know if that was the  right thing to do.  He says  he's too tired to meet up. I don't  know what to do."
depression,2020/01/06,"Sometimes I just don't have the motivation to do anything I want any more. I (21M) am really struggling with my inner mind and trying to move on in life. 2019 was not a great year.. I had a major concussion from wrestling and I had more mental struggles.  

I was also in a romantic relationship of a year and then I got dumped and got treated like a monster. I loved her and cared for her, and she gave other men affectionate attention and valued their approval online instead of me valuing and loving her, and it caused me to feel betrayed and get even more depressed. Then I eventually pushed her away and now I'm afraid to date anybody else. I'm burnt out on whole ""online dating"" world. It seems to bland and all the girls act the exact same.. But it seems like that's how you'll meet someone in this generation. 

I flunked out of college. I tried to move back home but my family drama is giving me anxiety and more depression. I'm getting treated like I'm 16 years old again. My grandpa is dying from dementia. I've had depression my whole childhood from my grandparents, childhood pets, and some close friends passing away..

Things just seem to be kicking me down and every day it gets harder to get up.."
depression,2020/01/07,"Lonely, unhappy and losing the will to succeed 18M in my first year in university, studying a joint honours degree in the UK. My exams are a week away but my mind is in a really bad place.


I have been bullied for a very large portion of my life, age 11 being as far back as I can remember. My entire class in primary school was against me and there was almost nobody who stuck up for me when I truly needed support. I moved into a new city aged 12 drained of any confidence I had and I hoped that by starting somewhere new for high school the bullying would stop, but it still continued. I was picked on and mocked for my weaknesses and differences from everybody else in school and throughout those years I had next to no friends. Any ""friends"" I had weren't close friends and were only people I spoke to because I happened to be in the same place with them at the same time. Fortunately I was far too naive to consider suicide and I played games on my computer as a way of coping. 


It wasn't until my college years that the bullying subsided since everybody matured but I then began to realise how lonely I was. Everybody had a solid circle of friends and I just couldn't fit into any of them. Approaching and saying hello to people wasn't any easier since what people have said to me in the past really stuck with me. It's this overpowering anxiety and fear of judgement that causes me to avoid contact and social interactions with anyone. Even when I manage to join a group of people I always turn out to be the silent one because there wasn't a lot I had in common with anyone and my due to my lack of social interaction over the years, I had next to nothing to contribute. 


The only thing that kept my hopes up at the time was my grades. In school I did very well during my GCSEs and with university coming up I had a reason to do well in my A levels. It is this time in my life where I could meet truly like-minded individuals and forge relationships that would last a lifetime (Or so I hoped). Despite my feelings of loneliness in college I persevered and achieved the highest A level grades in my classes and with that settled I was off to university. I was excited at first because being alone almost all my life I thought I could finally put all the bullshit from school behind me, start a new life with new people in a new place and for the first time make close friends and possibly get a girlfriend.


But now I realise nothing has changed.


I remain alone with nobody to fall back on or talk to and I'm at the point of giving up on trying. All the problems I had with loneliness persisted from college. Everybody around me, people who study the same course as me and people who live in the same flat as me, have all gotten along so well so quickly and once more I feel as though I'm not worth anybody's time. When I'm about in university I tend to notice how everybody's made friends with each other. Socialising, laughing and sometimes loving. Everybody makes it look so easy and as the bonds between these people strengthen with every passing day I'm left with nobody outside my family I can truly connect with. I can't even keep up a conversation no less start one and it's rare that I'm able to relate to anyone. Sure I've made some friends but I can never contact them since I know they have other people who, let's be honest, are more interesting than I'll ever be. Sometimes there's this lingering doubt in my mind that causes me to struggle to accept them as a friend. Every time I'm going somewhere and I see couples holding hands it makes my blood boil. It's another grim reminder of something I so desperately need but I can't ever have. It's literal torture.


I've opened up a little bit to some people but they always seem to respond the same way ""If you need anything, you can talk to me."" But can I really? It's just another mental barrier that's impossible for me to overcome. What if that person's busy and I'm holding them up on something important? What if they're out with their own friends and I'm stopping them from enjoying themselves? What if I look like an attention seeker?


I'm starting to feel seriously unhappy. Without any good friendships or relationships I no longer have any motive to do well in university and any enthusiasm I once had for my degree is fading with every passing day. Everybody in my degree on the other hand seems to be doing so much better with their studies. I just can't compete with them anymore. The quality of my work is getting worse when I know I can do and have done so much better, but university life is becoming so overwhelming and I feel so isolated I can't push myself to do better.


Sometimes I wish I could just quit altogether, but what good will that do me now? It's too late for me to go back and I'm already letting myself and my family down enough as it is."
depression,2020/01/07,"I want to run away 17M I got suspended from school for 2 days yesterday for having a vape, they called me and my friends out of class and made us empty out our pockets no context or anything. My dad always works out of town and my mom is “sick” from work so I am here with her all day. She yells at me for anything, I just got yelled at 30 min ago for wearing a black t-shirt that I got from my grandparents for Christmas while doing the dishes because it’s “too new”. I just got yelled at again because I started to take clothes out of the dryer to fold them and she was mad that I didn’t restart the dryer to “freshen the clothes” again before I folded them. She yelled at me yesterday when she found out about how stupid I am for doing it and I said yea it was dumb, but she proceeded to yell at me for it and tell me how gross it is, while she was smoking a cigarette. She literally hates me and is the worst parent I have ever seen in my life, she is drunk almost every night and my sister is 21 and my mom smoked weed with me and my sister a few weeks ago then the next day yelled at me for it and said it will ruin my life."
depression,2020/01/07,"Went to a top school, graduated a year ago, now want to commit suicide I am 23M. Graduated from university last year. Unemployed. Without a car. Without a girlfriend or social life. Without financial independence. 

With parents who resent me more and more everyday.

With an expensive degree that loses value day after day. 

And without a will to live.

Six years ago I got admitted to a top STEM program and moved a couple hours away from home. I was overjoyed. I was smart and going to have a bright figure. Guaranteed a good social life and career. More good grades too. Everyone told me this and I bought it. How naive and idealistic.

I didn't recognize my own fundamental weaknesses. I wasn't capable of it. I didn't realize I was fat and had a bad personality; didn't see what others saw when they first saw me. I didn't know I lacked willpower. I didn't know I couldn't cope with failure. I didn't know I had thyroid problems or ADHD. 

... I didn't know that I would fail my drivers license tests and become anxious about cars, roads, driving. I didn't know I would be shit at my major, do unrelated internships and be outclassed by other candidates for jobs - for internships and even now. I didn't know I could make it into a final round interview only to have the interviewers immediately invert their opinion of me (because I'm fat). I didn't know I would make no friends - and everyone would be more successful than me. I didn't know my ego would fall apart so much so fast. I didn't know I was little else.

So yeah. Here I am. Same as 5-6 years ago, except worse. Because now I know what I am to the world. Fat, unsociable and unemployed. And now, unemployed, unable to move around, with a lot of debt and disappointment. And as always incapable of self improvement.

I want to kill myself. Not that I will but I want to.

And with this great burden, I am expected to achieve infinitely more than I did before in my life. Make money, have a career, have a wife and kids. Be a good brother and a son. Live long and happy.

What a joke."

I grow up with my grandparents until I was 8 and my parents took me to city. However, I was visiting my grandparents every other weekends. I’ve decided to come to Canada for schooling when I was 17. It was December 2012. I graduated high school at 19 and finished my electrical engineering program in collage. 
  So I got a job and married a Canadian woman as well. I was visiting South Korea once every year but I never told my grandparents that I have PR ( permanent residentship ) and thinking of getting citizenship as well.
  I couldn’t lie to my grandpa anymore since he is very old and my poor grandma just had stroke twice last year. She’s recovering now. I couldn’t be there.... because of my work and cost of fight tickets... so I told my grandpa that I have PR when I was on FaceTime with him last night. He was holding his tears up and telling me that feels happy that I’m doing well. I have no idea what to do with my depression... I cannot stop thinking about my grandpa...

depression,2020/01/07,"I’m supposed to start college again tomorrow morning. I feel like can’t do it. [23M] It’s been 4 years since I last finished a semester of college. I completed 2 years, no associates though because the university I’m at only offers 4 year degrees. In my time out of school I’ve been working but quit my job in November because management was heading south, fast and by the spam texts I’ve been getting from coworkers it seems I made the right decision. 

I have a pretty hefty savings account as I’ve just been living at home and have no expenses other than student loans but my parents are expecting me to be doing something here soon. I told them I’d be going back to school, I’m all registered and set to start tomorrow but I just can’t...

I can’t see it working out just like it didn’t before. I still have no real idea of what I want to major in, I don’t want to waste tons of money by taking random classes to figure it out. The program I did end up on is going to be another 4 years if I start it. I don’t have the attention span, or the motivation, or the want to attend class. I can barely get up and get there on time, my brain doesn’t stay focused. I zone out so fast, I can’t sit still at a desk. And I don’t just want to go... I don’t know what I’m doing with my life."
depression,2020/01/07,"Should I try medication? (18M) A little over two years ago I had my depression diagnosed after some pretty bad manic episodes (including a few bad panic attacks and genuinely wanting to end my life / no concern for whether I live or not). I was able to find motivation to try and be happier and decided that I didn’t want to use medication or try talking with psychologists. I tried really hard to feel better and I improved a little bit, but my depression has always stuck with me. What’s concerning to me now is that when things are going relatively well for me in life (just got great grades for my first quarter of college, met an amazing girl that I have been dating for 3 months, made a group of really cool friends) I’m not able to enjoy these things because it’s just so damn difficult for me to be happy. Whenever I try to think of what’s going well for me in life, I can only think about when all this good stuff is going to end. I’m really unable to just enjoy the positive things in life because of my extreme pessimism and my chronic anxiety makes me stressed about any inconvenience. I really don’t want to slip back to where I was two years ago, and I wonder if getting professional help would be beneficial for me, or if opening up about my problems to my friends would be helpful in any way."

depression,2020/01/09,"Longing for the sister I never had I was on a 14-hour plane ride from Rome to Miami yesterday and spent the entirety of the ride talking to a super chill girl from Miami \[20F\] who's studying in Tallahassee. We were able to talk about anything and it's obvious that we see each other as just friends but for some reason, she felt like the sister I \[24M\] never had. I only have one brother \[22M\] and have thought about how much better life would feel if we also had a sister who is only a couple years younger. What conversations we would have, what living with a sister would be like, what our social lives would look like, how we would shape each other and change each other for the better. Thinking about it too much gets me upset but I have always felt like I was missing something from my life and maybe this is it. A girl who can truly share, do, and be anything with me and who I can truly share, do and be anything with, as two inseparable chill friends. Almost like brother and sister."
depression,2020/01/09,"Chronic illness, chronic pain, anxiety and depression (19F) Hey sorry I'm just going to spill all of my problems right here in my first and most likely last Reddit post. Enjoy!

For as long as I can remember I've suffered with chronic illness and chronic pain. For those who are unsure, this is illness and pain which has carried on for an extended period of time (usually more than a few weeks), in my case years. Recently I have been actively trying to find the cause of my health issues, but unfortunately have come up blank again and again. I am now being sent to a rheumatologist, for arthritis and auto-immune disease. It's becoming difficult to go to the doctor as I'm terrified of the outcome and there is no motivation behind getting better because it seems impossible.
I'm finding an increase in my anxiety, which was usually only in social situations. I now feel anxious 24/7. I think it's mostly because of the uncertainty of what's wrong with me, and if it is an auto-immune disease/arthritis, I've seen how much they affect people's lives and I don't want the rest of my life to be pain and medications. 
And then I get anxious that maybe my partner (19M) will get sick of me. I'm always tired, my mood swings are hectic, and my sex drive has virtually vanished. He tells me he doesn't care about sex, and I want to believe him but it's just so hard considering he's only 19 as well. I feel like I'm making his life stressful, and he is missing out on so much. As much as I don't want to, I get incredibly jealous when he talks to a female friend, or chooses his hobbies over spending time with me. I don't want to feel like this because then I cause arguments and he thinks I don't trust him. I feel his frustration all the time, which just makes me more anxious and depressed that he wants to leave but feels bad for doing so. Sometimes I wonder if I should just leave so he can be with someone fit, healthy and ready to live.
I know he doesn't want to leave me, and this is just the voice in my head telling me these things, but it's so hard to fight it. I feel so alone. I don't have any motivation to do anything. I love art, but can't find the right head space to do it. It just feels as if there's no point. I don't want to live the rest of my life sick, I want to really live it or not at all.
For my job I'm a trades person, so a majority of the time I'm driving. It is increasingly difficult to not do something and make it look accidental. Steer into a truck going 90km/hr. Maybe a tree that looks thick enough to do some severe damage. I get this strange feeling that comes over me like I could just suddenly jerk the steering wheel and it'd be over with. I think the only reason I've stopped myself is my family. I was lucky enough to have a family who, in spite of being emotionally disconnected, they'd still care if they knew how I feel. I have little siblings and cousins as well, some of which wouldn't  understand what had happened. I feel guilty about how I'd make everyone else feel. In a way, putting everyone else above myself has become a good thing, for once."
depression,2020/01/10,"A Serious of Unfortunate Events... Hi everyone. I've re-written this a few times because it is very difficult for me to write about, so hopefully it will be more coherent now. To give a bit of background, I am 21F. Unfortunately, I feel like I am a very unlucky person. I feel very depressed and upset. Don't get me wrong - I am in a great relationship with my significant other (24M) and have been for 4 years now, I have an amazing family, and I'm pursuing a good education.. but I feel that things in my life are destined to go awry. Like God is punishing me for something. 

It feels odd laundry-listing major events that have happened my life, but it shapes what I am talking about when I refer to my ""bad luck"" or the constant bad things that are occurring. I'm going to list things by grade/age:

* Age 6 - My Mom and Dad divorced. My mom remarries to my stepdad and had my younger sister. My dad remarries to my stepmom and had my younger brother.
* Third grade half 1 - My mom divorces my stepfather, who I became very close to, and begins dating his brother (essentially my uncle.) We move in with him and his kids from a previous marriage and I switch schools. My mom and stepfathers brother get engaged.
* Third grade half 2 - While I'm vacationing with my grandparents, my stepfathers brother dies of su\*\*\*\*\*. My mom suffered from mental illness and alcohol addiction, so this made it much worse. My mother and I move in with my grandparents and I switch schools again.
* Fourth grade - My mom buys a house and moves about 20 minutes away from grandparents, where I switch schools again. She is suffering badly with alcohol abuse and I have to deal with it, often being woken up by her in a drunken state.
* Fifth grade - My Nana, who was my rock, passes away from breast cancer.
* Sixth and seventh grade - My mom is in and out of jail for DUI's. I am going back and forth from my mom's home to my aunt's home.
* Eighth grade - When my mom got sentenced with a longer jail term, I move in with my dad, stepmom, and younger brother (none of whom I was particularly close to) and switch schools again. I visit my Mom in jail, talk to her on the phone, and sometimes write letters. She then attempted su\*\*\*\*\*. She passed from brain complications a few months later. I went to a therapist twice but convinced her I was fine. I really would go again and think it would help, but don't have the money.
* Sophomore year - My stepmom (who I became close to) passes of breast cancer, and at the time we were not on great terms.

Now, to the present day... I've been diagnosed with NAFLD. I feel like bad things are constantly coming my way and am afraid of ever being happy with fear of impending bad luck reaching me. I am in college, but have barely any friends, because I am not even sure what I enjoy doing anymore. I can't find passion for anything and do not have any hobbies. I love to travel (especially to Disney!), but I don't have the money to do that all of the time. Overall, I just feel lonely and scared and often have serious existential crisis' where I fear that I am going to pass away.

I think I am just scared to live, but I do not want to die. I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice on how to get rid of bad luck, or how to find purpose in life or activities? I know it is mostly perspective, but I seriously feel like good things never come my way, and if they do they're quite short-lived. I sincerely thank anyone who has read this and has any advice to offer. I'm just feeling really depressed and do not know what to do anymore. Thank you."
depression,2020/01/10,"18M I started going to psychiatrist She prescribed me with few drugs that only worsened the situation.

depression,2020/01/11,"FOMO, anxiety and depression are ruining my life  

20M here.

I'm what some would call an ""introvert extrovert"". I like to be alone sometimes, but I also enjoy hanging out.

The problem is, I always feel like my presence is unnecessary for most of my friends. People just don't care about wheter or not I'm around.

I have goals, I go to the gym, I try to become the best version of myself everyday. But that's not enough..

I see everyone going out, having fun while I'm here sitting at my desktop on a friday night...

I might be losing my 20's to anxiety and depression, and I just don't know what to do about it. It gets really tough and sad when you work hard on yourself everyday but no one seems to give a fuck about you.

Honestly, I'm not exaggerating, sometimes I feel like I'm going to end up alone, sad and depressed.... living with remorse. Wishing I could have enjoyed my life more.

However, I'm young, I still can change that... If you have any advice that will help me, pls share. Thank you!!"

depression,2020/01/11,Clinical depression strategies I'm 22M and struggle with clinical depression. Some days are easier than others to fend off the negative thoughts I get when I feel down on my self and some days I just feel this way for no reason. Today was going well until I went into work and all of the sudden my chest started to feel heavy and I started to think negatively about myself. I had been doing alright for a week. I was challenging myself to be more outgoing to conquer my social anxiety and attempting to have a genuine smile on my face more often to have pleasant conversations with strangers which is an improvement. I've been reminding myself that I deserve to be happy and that I shouldnt get down on myself because I tend to over think things. I'm not certain if my anxiety is also at play here but I'm definitely feeling something depressing. Does anybody feel the same? if so what kind of strategies or coping mechanisms do you use to avoid this feeling?
depression,2020/01/11,"I Feel Like A Porn Version Of A Crackhead Baby  

I'm a 32M and I think its fair to say that I am a porn version of a crackhead baby. as far as I remember I started watching porn at the age of 6 thanks to growing up in a third world country where its government does not show any concern about what goes on in the TV. because of this, the Playboy Channel was actually a local channel. when I move here to America during the 90s things did not get any better as we had the Spice and Adam &amp; Eve channel included in our cable. Aside from this I also had older siblings who use to leave their porn videos and magazines lying all over the place.

aside from porn I also feel traumatized by the voyeur life I was forced to live. during these days my mom was a retailer of underwear, lingerie, and other intimate female attires. she uses to sell them either at home or other places like at the client's home, salons, etc. and she would bring me along to help her carry the merchandise. while there I remember they all used to come out of their clothes all the time to try on the merchandise all in front of me and disregarding my presence, some even used to tease me. aside from that, my mom was also a frequent traveler and she would leave me with lots of her friends and relatives. in some instances, I've would overhear these people have sex from a room distant apart some nights.

* fast forward till today I been a big porn fiend and it has affected my sex life in many ways.
* it has made me fear women
* barely feel pleasure during intercourse
* cant maintain a good erection unless I have porn thoughts and focus on them
* cant even orgasm/ejaculate via intercourse
* always have to tell my sex partners to give me handjobs instead, but even then I still can't orgasm right away unless it's my hand. and if I do I feel a little pain and discomfort.

till then I think I already lost hope in finding a treatment for this, even though I'm thankful because I know there are a lot of folks who had it worse than me out there"
depression,2020/01/12,"Parents are my controlling my (20M) life and I am depressed My parents do not allow me to live in a university dormitory, go outside alone unless to class, get a license. Frankly they don’t let me do anything without their permission or alongside them. This all has gotten more severe in the last 2 years. 

I came into college with a clear career path and joy for the future. Now I am questioning what I want with my future likely because they control everything. I have lost nearly all my self confidence. I find it hard to push back because I know they will either make false promises or say no. I remain optimistic but it’s tough.  

I realize I have posted a lot on here, but if anybody has any sort of positive advice I would greatly appreciate it."

depression,2020/01/12,"She ended it All my life has been filled with tough times, I (22M) had a PTSD from bullying, depression, anxiety. My 1st true relationship ended in disaster, she ghosted me. All my life have I been searching for love and then my ex-girlfriend (23F) came in my life. I felt purpose again, happiness, love and I could finally fully love someone with my heart. We spend so much time together, had so many happy moments, we are such a good match and understand each other, it all seemed so perfect. Sadly, Her ""heart"" still lies with her ex, she is obsessed over him because of her BPD. All this time I fought hard and hard to keep her, I tried everything and showed her all my love to make her realize that she means the world to me, she appreciated it but was confused, she loved me but did not realize it. And even though she still likes me, she feels like she needs to be alone for now and recover. I love this woman with my heart and soul. So here I am, alone again, not knowing what to do or how to feel. It's just empty and sadness, no purpose. I miss her voice, I miss seeing her, I miss our fun times together.

depression,2020/01/13,"getting abandoned constantly (pls read) Can’t believe I’ve succumbed to the depression subreddit, but here it goes.

I’m a gr12 student (18M), and I’ve always been abandoned by my friends and romantic interests. My elementary best friend abandoned me in gr9, leaving me with no one. My gr9 best friends who I made from scratch (they were like brothers to me) abandoned me in gr10. 

Every woman I’ve tried to get with in high school has either played me, hooked up with me once and then gotten a bf a week later, or chill with me a few times and then ghost me completely.

This rly has me bummed out and depressed. I just don’t feel like I’m good enough for anyone to stick around. I run through my relationships with different ppl in my head, WONDERING WHERE IT WENT WRONG.

Has anyone else had this feeling? How did you deal with it?

Extra info if it helps:  Im pretty popular, attractive, smart, a little introverted, went to a big high school, am nice to almost everyone.

Thanks."
depression,2020/01/14,"I need advice: My long distance bf (20M) told me (19F) he's feeling depressed and possibly suicidal. Do I tell his sister? Hi guys,

I'm in class right now but I can't focus knowing something might be going really wrong. I've been dating this guy for a few months. He's in Detroit working from home and I'm in Chicago going to university. He's had undiagnosed depression probably since he was like 8 (he's got a lot of fucked up family stuff). However, whenever I suggest he get therapy (as I have for my own family issues and depression) he turns it down.

Last night he told me he's been having a tough week. Today, he woke up at 1 pm and texted me that he's feeling really awful. He's saying stuff like no one likes him and he's so alone and doesn't have the motivation to fix it. I know he has guns and I'm really worried that he could easily put himself in danger or kill himself. He stopped responding to my texts about 20 mins ago and I'm scared.

I know he's pretty close with his sister but I don't know how much of the depression stuff he's told her. She also probably doesn't know that he's dating me but this seems like more of a pressing issue than possibly revealing our relationship to her even if he weren't ready to share. I don't want to embarrass him but I'm worried about his safety. I'm thinking of sending her a DM over instagram saying something like: ""Hi \[Her Name\], I don't know if you know me but I've been seeing \[His Name\] for a few months. He's been telling me some pretty worrying stuff for the past week and I'm scared he's feeling depressed and alone. I'm in school in Chicago and can't come see him, but I was thinking you might want to check on him."" Does that sound like a good idea?

TL;DR: My long distance boyfriend is saying he's depressed and possibly suicidal. Should I tell his sister (who I don't know) to go check on him?"
depression,2020/01/14,"Loneliness I (17M) have struggled with depression for around a year and a half now. I shift between periods of apathy and depression- it's rare for me to feel joy. My life feels cold and hopeless.

My emotional struggles were relatively minor at first, but they worsened after I went through a breakup and developed a chronic illness. I haven't recovered since then. Ultimately, I believe that the cause is loneliness.

Because I'm autistic, I have never had many friends. Currently, I'd say that I only have one true friend. We message eachother often, but in some ways, it feels like it's only a brief of what I lack- human connection.

Why don't people like me? I wish that I could have a real social life and a loving, non-cheating girlfriend. Many people, particularly NTs, seem to have no trouble attaining that. My lack of human connection is driving me insane. Maybe if I wasn't so lonely, the rainclouds would go away."
depression,2020/01/14,"I (21M) can't stop feeling guilty for cheating on my girlfriend (23F) unless I get hit. I've been depressed for a long time, I often feel numb and could go days or weeks without talking to anyone, I only break out of it when I'm forced to. But, recently, my ex-girlfriend, of 8 months, broke up with me because I drunkenly made out with a guy at a party (I'm bisexual) and didn't tell her, she only found out when someone there told her and my depression has only got worse, I'm not numb anymore, I just feel guilty and psyically sick. But what makes me feel worse is the way I process that guilt, I know it's messed up and unhealthy but it's the only way it works.

I deserved to be broken up with, I cheated and I'm an asshole, I know that. I was never a good boyfriend even before this. So, we broke up but a few days letter she messaged me that she forgives me and we should stay friends. Even though she said she forgives me I don't think I deserve her forgiveness and her saying that just made me feel even more guilty because I know I hurt a kind person.
I was brought up by pretty aggressive people where when you upset/angered/betrayed someone, you got hurt even if it wasn't always deserved. Now I think I genuinely deserve to get hurt and I think its the only way to stop me feeling guilty. But, I know she would never hit me, even if I asked her to.
So, I asked a mutual friend (26M) that we met through. This mutual friend is much more than a friend to me, he's the person I trust the most with anything and he's helped me so much in life in ways I can't even describe. So, I explained to him how I was feeling and asked if he'd hit me. He just went with a flat no and said he'd never do that. I tried to rile him up and get him angry at me so he would, but he's never really got angry with me and it didn't work. I don't want to be properly beaten up, I just want to get properly slapped. I have a few other friends, who probably wouldn't even if I asked, but I don't think they'll stop my guilt in the same way.
I don't know what to do. It's been almost 2 weeks since we broke up and a couple days since I asked the mutual friend and I just feel like I've been festering. I live with the mutual friend and I feel even more guilty every time I see him, he looked so disappointed when I told him why we broke up. He keeps saying that it's okay and that I shouldn't feel bad because she forgives me but he won't do what I asked to help me feel better. I've seen my ex a few times since then as well, only with other people there, and just can't enjoy myself because I can't think about anything other than seeing her cry when she confronted me about it.

I want to go back to feeling okay, even if okay is just numb. And the way I think I can do that is so messed up and I know that, which just makes me feel worse. I know it's messed up to ask my friend do that, as people on another sub have said but I just want to feel better.
Any advice?"
depression,2020/01/15,"I guess I just need to let some stuff out Sorry if this kind of goes all over the place or is confusing. 

I guess I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for the better part of 3 or so years. Most of it, I think, ends up revolving around school. I've never been diagnosed or anything and I always felt it got better eventually so I never really reached out to a therapist or doctor or anything.

I(25M) just entered my last semester of college. I was ecstatic. I graduated high school in 2012 and have been struggling to finish, balancing working full time and school. Every semester, around the beginning mostly but several times throughout, I start to get a lot of anxiety and I get really sad about everything. The work seems overwhelming and I can't help but think of all the time I have to dedicate to do well and how I won't have time for myself really. I end up working all day, doing homework when I get home, walk my dog and play with him a little because I feel bad neglecting him but he is my best friend, and then usually watch some TV before bed. My off days from work are filled with school and classes so it feels like I never get a break. 

This time, when I started the semester on Monday, I was welcomed with a ton of work for the semester and a ton of work for the first assignment. I would say maybe 3 weeks of work and research due in 1 week. Not to mention, I still have other classes that start on Thursday. I was really really hoping for an easy last semester with maybe one class that requires a lot of work but now it seems like this semester will be the hardest yet. I should mention, I go to school for digital media. Lots of design work and branding and marketing. Especially marketing and branding ourselves. Lots of projects and research. 

I know it's not the end of the world, lots of people have a ton of work for college. There are harder degrees out there. But for some reason, this really really affected me. I had a panic attack after class and sobbed in my car for some reason. 

Not sure if this has anything to do with anything, but I also slammed my finger in my car door last Thursday and it's been healing slowly. Doctors basically just tell me that you just have to let it heal on its own but it's been giving me a lot of anxiety. 

Anyways, after Monday, I just felt worse than I ever have before. I've been so depressed it's been hard to do anything. At work I'm quiet and keep to myself. Once I get home I'm tired and just wanna lay down and nap. Yesterday instead of working on homework when I got home, I just felt so exhausted I fell asleep on the couch. I had to force myself up to walk and feed my dog. I haven't had any appetite and have been forcing myself to eat because I know I need to eat something. I've hardly been eating anything though. Parts of sandwiches, some fries maybe and then I feel full or nauseous and can't finish it. 

This is worse than I've ever felt and I can't seem to shake it. I just want to feel normal again and I don't want to be sad and tired all the time. My fiancee(23F) has been very supportive but we are in a long distance relationship until this summer. She's been away for over a year now and I proposed back in October. She tries to talk to me as much as she can but throughout the day she is at work and of course gets busy. I totally understand that. But I really look forward to getting her messages because it makes me feel just a little better. I'm really hoping that after this week or so things start going back to normal. I keep telling myself it's only 4 more months and I'll be done and all my hard work will have paid off, but I just can't seem to feel better. I cry in the morning, on my lunch break, on my way home from work, and once I get home. I just wish there was a way to make this just go away. 

Again, sorry if this was all over the place or hard to understand. I just felt like I needed to get it off my chest as I don't really have many people to express these feelings to and I don't want to overwhelm my fiancee because she isn't a therapist. She doesn't deserve to bear the weight of her stress and also mine. 

Anyways, thanks for reading I guess. And thanks for having this place available"
depression,2020/01/15,"Just felt that it needs to be said. What do I start with? I guess it’ll be who I am

I’m a 14M and I’ve been diagnosed with depression 2 months ago. Everything was going downhill since, but was spiraling when certain events happened. I’ve lost friends over time, I’ve lost hope in living, I’ve tried suicide, and more. School isn’t helping at all. I tried talking to the counselors about this and all they said was “We can’t do anything for you, sorry” to top it off, anxiety kept me going like this. Today, January 15th, is the day I no longer stand by this. I will overcome this. I’m starting small by doing things to keep me moving, then I’ll try and get friends back and more. 

TL;DR: I have depression and anxiety, I will do the best against it"
depression,2020/01/15,"Unsure if I should consider SSRIs? Hi guys. So I am 31M. I am occasionally prone to anxiety, I mean every 2-3 years and usually health related, but that isn't the case right now and between these episodes I have always been a very positive, happy and energetic person. Feeling low/depressed is very rare for me.

However due to some issues with things like visas and relationships my short, medium and long term future is a bit up in the air. I know what I want but there are hoops to jump through to get there and no guarantees there won't be issues along the way. I know this more less describes everyone but right now this is completely deflating me. I have very little energy or motivation and I have this constant feeling that everything is going to go wrong, even without specific thoughts about what.

It's been about 2 months of feeling this way now and the visa stuff is just dragging on and on and I feel very burnt out. I know that if it is resolved, which could happen at any moment, I will be very happy and probably go back to normal but I just worry that I have these feelings of low mood, anxiety and impending doom not even attached to any specific thoughts anymore - they are just there regardless.

For this reason I'm wondering if I should consider SSRIs or if it's preferable to avoid medication when there may be a resolution of the life issues in the near future?"
depression,2020/01/16,"Going nowhere in life 31M. I don't have any kind of real future. Still live at home with my parents, dead end job that I hate, never been in a relationship. I feel like I should just give up because I don't see any kind of improvement ever happening. Considered killing myself but I'd probably screw that up as well. I'm just not worth anyone's time."
depression,2020/01/16,"[24M] virgin who’s never had a girlfriend, and it’s literally on my mind 24/7..... I’m terrified of ending up a 30-40+ year old lonely virgin.

I’m considered ugly by most women, apparently. And the few who find me attractive, apparently I’m cute like a baby, “cute”, “adorable”, I have a “babyface”.

Being this “baby” and “cute” and “adorable” type of good-looking, isn’t sexually attractive, is it?

I’m heavily into gentlefemdom, so I would imagine that being “cute” would be more appealing to dommes as opposed to “sexy stud”. But MOST women are submissive and want dominant men, and my nature is the complete opposite. I need that nurturing and affection...

Even though I’m attractive to SOME NUMBER of women, being called ugly (usually very explicitly) has destroyed any confidence and self esteem.

I’m missing out on life, all because I’m physically ugly, or because being called ugly so much has made me believe it and lose all and any ounce of confidence and self esteem.

I feel genuinely hopeless, and that the existence of 30,40,50 year old virgins is reason to believe my fate is the same, because I’ve been lonely and celibate for 24 years already.

I’m scared a therapist would try to talk me into becoming content with being a loser, as opposed to becoming successful with the life I want.

I still don’t have my driver license, it’s hard to be able to practice, and not being able to drive is life crippling outside of metropolises (like NYC, Boston, San Francisco, etc). Uber/Lyft cost hundreds a month of you need it to go everywhere everyday.

I failed as a child, and as a teenager, and now I can’t transition to adulthood.

By the way, I was unable to leave the house for two years because I was too scared to drive and at the time was in a rural area, my parents told me I was selfish for wanting a ride into town to try and get a job.

Even in a decently urban area (without transit) I’m still in a pretty toxic household.

I actually had to argue against my mom because she wanted me to download the Life 360 app, just for being home from work a little late.

She chased after me in the car and made me get in when I tried to walk 2 miles to eat somewhere, yelling at me how I’d get killed from a car or getting shot (sometimes I hope for this!)

Before you go with the simple but true “You’re too old to have your phone tracked!” My parents actually use it on each other’s phones, constantly getting real-time notifications of location. 

And, while it is to watch criminal activity, the house cameras constantly alert all of our phones when anybody walks through the door, or even just walks by the house, and i often get texted “Where are you going?” “What’s wrong?” “I see you”. Not just from my mom, my step dad too.

That’s bad enough, tracking my constant location? I might have to visit an escort to lose my virginity in 2020, they’d see me going to an area wanting to know what I’m doing there!

I feel pretty hopeless being so universally ugly though, it’s ruined my life. The worst part is feeling that my fate is already sealed, 

I’m too depressed and hopeless to be happy and enjoy anything.

Masturbating even sucks now, I get off on humiliating, painful cuck shit, or just feel pathetic being a virgin who cums to porn in general.

It seems ridiculous that poor physical looks are enough to keep me lonely and celibate.

You don’t get anything in life without effort, yet people say you’ll meet someone when not looking,"
depression,2020/01/16,"Well, I (18M) feel like a complete piece of trash as far i can remember. Well, I (18M) feel like a complete piece of trash,

(If somethings written here don't make sense for you, I apologize, I'm not a native speaker of the language).

I have always had problems in getting along with the people around me, I was bullied in all the schools/kindergartens I went to, I was even forced to participate in activities with other ""problem children"" a few times when I was 7, as a type of therapy to solve these problems with communication (which didn't help me since I felt extremely uncomfortable around the other people). 

My life isn't what many people find difficult, my parents always loved me so much, gave me attention and access to everything I needed in monetary matters, but I still getting worse over the years. I have severe depression and the whole package of most common mental illnesses, plus some traumas I prefer not to talk about. Away from home I've always been treated like shit, either for being too quiet, or being smarter than the rest of the class, or for looking intimidating by my size as a child and people using this to blaming their shit on me, or for being ugly and/or too fat.

Ever since I can remember, I've always felt the urge to take away my own life, not because I didn't want to live, but because ""they"" always made me think this is what scum should do.

I've never hurted anyone, never betrayed anyone and yet it seems like I'm a bad person, ""they"" never had given me the chance to learn how to talk with them and yet they blamed me for being too quiet.

In the last two years I have been through very complicated situations, in friendship and in relationships.  I've lost my best friend because some stuff ruff happened, I've lost the girl I cared and protected for over two years, just because I wasn't the one she wanted, even though she needed me innumerous times. 

I feel bad about myself every day, sometimes I lose track of what is going on in my life, what I am doing... my memories are becoming more nebulous and my personality is getting worse by the minute. I am taking medicines to control my depression and anxiety, but these do not seem to help, I feel the emptiness growing stronger in my heart.

I didn't killed myself back in 2017-2019 because I was doing real therapy at the time, unfortunately my therapist changed his location and I don't have time to cross the state to see him every weekend and I don't have enough mental healt to look for another one by now.

Getting to the point, I just wish I could remember things well, and don't feel so worthless all the time even though I had achieved some things as a person. College isn't helping either, I can do much better than i do now, but I have failed it various ways by my lack of attention. 

Since I was 12 I can only feel and think negative things. I don't feel loved and can't love anymore, I feel like i care about certain things and at the same time i feel like i don't give a fuck to anything, sometimes I conflict with what is real or not in my mind, I suspect that my subconscious makes me see and feel distorted things in order to let me continue living.

I'd like to put an end to all this, suicide may not be an option, but if I'm dead, what difference does it makes ?

TL; DR: I don't enjoy being alive and I feel that everything aroud me is false (including my mind), some people are born to be the victims of others, and I am one of those people."
depression,2020/01/16,"My depression is destroying my (33M) relationship with my fiancé (38f) I was originally considering making an alt account, but decided against it as the whole reason I love reddit is that I can be myself. 

To summarize my problems, I’m a porn/masturbation addict. I have struggled with finding a job I genuinely enjoy and have been out of regular work for a couple of months. I also smoke weed well out of moderation. While I have never been diagnosed, I feel that I suffer from depression and anxiety. 

On Friday my fiancé called me out on my porn addiction. At some point she went through my phone and saw my alternate reddit account specifically for NSFW stuff. I also subscribed to personal adds and hook-up based reddits. I never planned on responding to them, I just found something appealing about seeing the posts. 

My jaw dropped when she was telling me about her discoveries. I always silently judged myself and hated myself for this addiction. I even told her as we were talking about it that I have never talked about it with anyone or expressed these feelings in any way. She was cheated on before and she said this felt like a worse betrayal. That she felt I would rather jerk off than be with her. I told her this simply isn’t true. The two reasons I feel I do it are when it’s late and I can’t sleep, or when I’m alone, depressed and need to feel something. I told her I don’t want to wake her up at 1 am for a lazy fuck. I told her the last thing I wanted to do was make her feel insecure, and that I only had myself to blame for all this. I needed this wake up call and started making changes. Our communication hasn’t been good lately and I asked her to help me be a better communicator as I would be trying to better myself. 

I got rid of all my porn files, all the stuff I had easily accessible. I unsubscribed to a lot of the Reddit’s on my NSFW account and hope to be rid of the account some day. I recently got my license to do life insurance and am starting with a new company.  

We spent all weekend being lovers and it has been nice. But all that loving threw my back out for the last couple days, so I wasn’t able to perform. Then, this morning, I woke up at around 8am. She usually sleeps in. I woke up and had the urge. I thought it would have been selfish to wake her up to ask for a blowjob, and my back was still completely out of the game. I started taking care of myself in the living room and eventually she came out and knew what I was doing. I tried to quickly explain myself and said “I’m sorry, my back is still fucked and I didn’t want to wake you”. Again, I thought it would be selfish to wake her and request anything of her, especially when I couldn’t reciprocate. 

She sent me a lengthy text and told me she is considering couples therapy, which I am absolutely for. I love her to death, she’s an amazing woman and I want to do better for her. It kills me to know that I’ve made her feel insecure and that my actions are destroying our relationship. 

I have no one to share this with. I don’t have many friends and can’t really confide in anyone personally. Even if I did this is embarrassing to mention. Maybe I’m posting for support, or accountability, or just advice. What I do know is I can’t do this alone and my fiancé has been through enough as it is. I’m scared I will lose her any day without warning and I can’t blame her for it."
depression,2020/01/17,"Been able to successfully keep myself out of bouts of deep depression for years, but a recent demotion at work has deflated me. Any advice or reassurance that anybody who’s been in the same boat might be able to offer? I (22M) work at a decently big car repair shop, and have for about three years. I was promoted about four or five months back into my first ‘real’ position after doing the equivalent of car shop grunt work for two and a half years (hooray,) and was initially very excited for my first employee review this week. 

Having had troubles with emotional imbalance and bouts of severe depression in the past, I’ve been thinking recently about how much I’ve improved since I started this position. All my new coworkers at the new building love me and tell me I’m doing an amazing job, I made friends I can actually talk to about shared interests during lunch for the first time in years, I could see plenty of room to grow in the company ahead of me, all seemed to be going great.

But I was called into my boss’ office today for evaluation and was told the worst thing they could have told me besides firing me outright: they would not be reexamining my pay (which I wasn’t too concerned about, a little raise would have been nice but I would have understood,) *and* I’d be required to go back to the ‘grunt work’ position I had before if I wanted to keep my job.

This is due to company restructuring and not my personal performance supposedly, but being blindsided by this hit me like a ton of bricks and I had my first bad anxiety attack in years, to the point where I was hyperventilating like crazy and almost passed out a few times. 

My (now former, I guess) boss was very understanding thankfully about me kind of breaking down in his office and said he would push for advancement opportunities for me in the future, but after almost three years of busting ass and doing my best to make my way up even just a little bit in this company it feels like all I’ve put in has been for nothing and it brought all my old anxiety symptoms rushing back. 

I don’t want to make myself miserable for potentially years until a new opportunity at the company opens up for me, and considering how I haven’t even done anything *wrong* to deserve this demotion it’s really taken the wind out of my sails as far as my general work ethic is concerned, I feel like I’ve put in all this energy just to get booted back to where I was but with a *slightly* better paycheck. 

I don’t know, I just needed to spiel because I’ve been beating myself up over this for hours. I don’t know whether to quit and look for a place that has a better chance of treating my work ethic right or just stick it out in my old shitty job, I’m kind of thankful I still have a job at all but the fact that it’s the position I crawled my way out of with a ton of effort and perseverance so I would have a more fulfilling role in the company... it just feels like a real kick in the teeth. I might need advice or I might just need some moral support, I’m really conflicted as to how to process all of this right now and what I should do from here."
depression,2020/01/17,"Deepest I've ever been  

It's time to get something off my chest, the entire story, no softening.

I really hope this won't get drowned under new posts and won't get seen.

This is a very long post filled with sadness, don't read if you don't feel like it. No TLDR's here. My apologies for swearing.

I'm 25 years old and - please don't take this in an arrogant way because I don't know how else to word it - highly intelligent. My entire life, be it school, uni, work, gaming, whatever, I'm just good at whatever I do. Usually one of the best.

Yet I am as insecure as can be. I don't like the way I look (mainly the face), I say stupid shit to friends and then regret it (even though I know they probably forgot it the moment I walk through the door), I think about freaking everything. Around when I was 18 I was fucking up my school and started to dwindle down into sadness.

This got worse and worse, to the point of depression and 50 meetings with a psychologist.This gave me some newfound strength and I pulled myself together and cleaned my room. It was a freaking mess, floor had multiple layers of trash, maggots walking around, plain fucking disgusting.

BUT I DID IT. And it felt so good.

I had all the standard symptoms; not able to get out of bed, eating badly, neglecting relationships with friends, but worst of all - lack of discipline and hygiene. So for the past 7 years I have barely brushed my teeth. I cannot get myself to do it. It's such a stupid minor thing you'd think it's no problem... but it is.

When I was 22 my teeth were basically rotting away. Huge brown gap between my front teeth and many many more problems.

AND THE PAIN. MAN.

The weirdest thing was that NONE of my friends or family ever said anything about it. Didn't they notice? Were they just being nice? I was so insecure and ashamed of myself, couldn't bare to look in the mirror.

Then an aunt of mine with plenty money decided to jump in and offered to pay for the entire dentist plan to get everything fixed. Even though I am terrified of that fucking tooth doctor, I was going to do this.

2 years of countless treatments (around 40), unimaginable pain, 4 teeth removed (molars luckily) and about €9k further, I had the balls to laugh with teeth again. It wasn't perfect, it was yellow, and it was a whole lot of clay, but it was a set of teeth that people were allowed to see.

So, all you have to do is just pick up the fucking toothbrush and maintain it, right? Yeah...

Now my teeth are quickly degrading to the same point as before, and fuck man I hate myself.

Back to the spiral of hating myself &gt; not getting out of bed &gt; hating myself more &gt; fucking everything up. For the past year the depression has been at its worst it's ever been. Committing suicide has become a daily thought.

When I'm laying in bed and summing up all the things I'm fucking up, and all the shit I've said to people and regret, I enter a very very dark hole.

Then the morning comes and I go to work again.

I have talked about this with my best friends and family. They support me with so much love, but they can't fix me. Nor do I believe another psychologist can fix me. I don't want be dependent on medication.

The funny thing is that (except for my teeth) for an outsider, I would probably be described as someone who has his shit together (some have even told me they look up to me, and that I am ""special"").

I have run my own software company for the past 2 years, with my 2 best friends. We have recently recruited our first employees, we are moving into a new office space this saturday (a whole floor for us)! and I currently earn an acceptable pay of €1.8k net, with the outlook of growing hard.

I have a couple of beautiful friends who I can share everything with, I love them to the moon and back. I even have a few great hobbies.

Everyone tells me how much they like me as a person and how they love it when I'm there.

But shit, I just cant get a grip on it. Every day is another wave of sadness. I'm just sticking around because people would fucking miss me (oh and my mom... I don't want to do that to you).

The thoughts are becoming more than just thoughts. Why live on this earth if I struggle with simple shit like brushing my teeth and just living in despair. Why keep dealing with it.

Man, I don't know anymore. I might just freaking do it.

Shit man, I kinda wish I wasn't this intelligent even with all the cool perks you get (learning! analyzing fast! logic! manipulating!).

A few pointers which might help understanding my fucked-upness better:

* I smoke a few joints about 3 days a week. Been doing this since 18
* Every now and then at parties I use some cocaine or 3MMC. Never out of line, once every few months
* I had a very troubled youth. My father was a heroin addict and my mother divorced him when I was 2. Since then my childhood has been a wishwash of moving (6 times), multiple schools, and arguing parents. I have always believed that my childhood has not affected my state of mind, but people close to me think otherwise.
* I have a very close relationship with my mother

I don't know exactly what I expect from you guys, or if I expect anything.

If you've had similar experiences and want to share I'd love to hear. Maybe we can help eachother. My friends support but they don't really understand. I'm open to any advice or opinions, but ""go out more"" and ""stop drinking"" type of advices won't resolve this shit. I've tried.

Thanks SO much for reading. This took me a lot of willpower to write up. I will try to reply to questions because I want to fucking fix this."
depression,2020/01/18,"Anyone had success with psychologist? Hi all,

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm a 29M and believe I have a mix of anxiety(diagnosed) and depression. I hate talking about it because all my problems are ""first world problems"" to the max. 

I'm 29, live in LA, have an amazing girlfriend and make almost 200K a year. Sounds great right? Fuck it all. I chased money throughout my twenties and now know that in amount of money can buy happiness. 

I hide it well and am considered a driven and even upbeat person by my peers. What they don't know is that I put on that fake mask every damn day and it's so, so tiring. 

I dont trust my girlfriend(irrationally), only have 1-2 genuine friends and have little family connections other than my dying father(cancer). 

Sorry that was a big bitch fest. Has anyone had success with seeing a psychologist? I found some in network with my insurance and am thinking about going."
depression,2020/01/19,"[19M] How to deal with bouts of depression? I wouldn't say I'm depressed, and I don't deal with any of these problems chronically. However, for the last several weeks I've felt no motivation, I've stopped cooking and budgeting, I wake up and I masturbate all day and I smoke a lot of weed. 

I have a long distance girlfriend and friends around me, I have a job which is really easy. Long distance sucks because I'm young and I miss her a lot and it sucks to have to be losing out on so much I guess. My job is really easy but it stresses out to no end, constantly worrying about my next shift and problems that don't exist. Other than this I try and workout/lift weights everyday, but like that's dragging myself and I've only done like 3 times a week opposed to 6 days like I've usually done.

I know some of these problems are specific to my life, but everyday I wake up and I don't see anything changing in my life that really makes me look forward to anything. Everything feels like I'm just somewhere between here and there. A place between zero and one. 

Thanks for reading.

depression,2020/01/21,"I want to just sleep forever without dying \[17M\] I think I've been depressed for about a year now. A few months ago my parents made me go to the doctor and I was prescribed pills to help with anxiety, but all they've done is made me feel even less happy. Before I was stressed and sad all the time, but now I guess I just feel like a husk or something? I feel like life has just worn me out by now. The routines and the monotony and waking up everyday just to keep feeling like trash...I don't get why I shouldn't off myself. I get the appeal of being alive, but it just kinda sucks for me. I'm tired of...*being*. I often catch myself staring at nothing for several minutes thinking about nothing in particular and passing out from exhaustion after full nights of sleep."
depression,2020/01/22,"Depression symptoms suddenly are gone (17M) One week ago I showed severe symptoms of depression (suicidal thoughts, self-harm and binge-eating sugary foods). Now for the past few days, I have been feeling moderately low, but not as suicidal as I was before. And I want to reach out for help, but I don't feel like I can convince my parents to help me with that. Thanks for any helpful advice or insights!"
depression,2020/01/22,"I don't know what's wrong with me. (21M) I'm exhausted. I feel like I've always had to put so much work and preparation just to function. I don't know what's wrong with me... I'm tired of talking to new professionals. I have a lot of issues and they're wearing me down. My issues seem to be triggered by heart breaks. I don't even know where to start. I've struggled with depression since before middle school. My first suicidal thought was in fifth grade. I feel like I have multiple sides to me. I'm a really ambitious person but on the other hand I'm reserved and sensetive. I struggle with anxiety especially social anxiety. I've always been quiet and shy, but when I open up Im always talking and moving. I'm very creative, I write, play instruments, sing (secretly lol), interested in stand up comedy, I enjoy living life and making people happy. On the other side of this I've been suffering. I'm impulsive, hypersexual, and just plain reckless. I don't mean to mess things up but I feel like I can't do anything right. I get super moody, I'm always up and down. This damages my reletionships. People like me, lots of people want to be my friend or be in a relationship with me but it just seems like too much. I struggle at communicating and my depression makes it difficult to be in a relationship. I take rejection really bad, it makes me overwhelmingly sad. Its hard talking about this because there's just so much, I'm a mess. I've dealt with depression since fifth grade, but it got really bad my junior year of high school after a heartbreak. Since then it hasn't improved.

Other lesser things I deal with are facial tics( only when I'm stressed and depressed), I enjoy alcohol sometimes too much. If anyone has any I for they can help me with I'd be forever grateful.

Summary: I have mood swings and a lot of other issues that's only getting worse."

Basically I (22M) hate my life and I hate myself. I've been depressed for some years time but I don't feel like I deserve it. I have friends. I have a great family that's always there for me. I do good in school, I work alot for my student union, and I also work part-time with a normal job for extra $. I believe that I look pretty good. I take good care of myself. I eat properly. But I'm always sad. I really hate myself but I don't really know why and that just put more fuel to my self-hatred fire. As soon as I'm alone my brain just start spittin shit about how I don't deserve to be happy and that I'm not worthy of anything. The thing is, there really isn't any reason for me to feel this way. I've never had a serious traumatic experience, except for basic shit like parents got divorced, toxic relationships, losing friends etc. I just don't feel like I have the right to be this to myself because my life is, on paper, good.

depression,2020/01/23,"Pretty Sure I am a Psycopath I \[21M\] have always had trouble trying to understand what others feel. I don't feel sad when I see someone really sad, or happy when someone is excited. I have known this since I was very young and for all my life I have been trying to understand those things. I don't understand how friends or family members communicate with each other, how their discussion topics steer from one point to other along with a dash of humor. For me things always go in a logical way. I would try to reason and think for everything being discussed before speaking up. I am a college student. My ""friends"" would discuss about the problems with college life and others would join in chorus talking how it affects them and my mind goes straight to thinking, what can I do to solve and improve the situation. Someone would say that he likes Oreos, and I would point out how the sugar compounds in the cream make brain release dopamine. Others would say ""I like it too"". I have learned such small things and am slowly learning to create such a fake conversation. I also don't like talking about other people and gossip really bores me\[Yep, unfortunately even guys gossip\]. I don't trust new people easily. I remember, when I was a kid, I would use my intellect to manipulate others. I no longer do that. I feel like I am always serious and tense, which is why I don't have any real friends, but merely acquaintances. Each and every decision I make is utility based and never have I considered my or the happiness of others. In my case, i simply don't know what would make me happy and so I go based on utility - Best university, More money.....In other people's case, I do get some idea of what they may want when I think hard about it basing on my past experiences, but I have never been able to do so quick enough to influence my decision, It usually is more of an after-thought. 

I don't have trouble communicating, since I have always been excellent in debates, speeches and presentations and have won competitions as well. I am extremely confident while on stage or even a one-to-one conversation, which has a clear purpose.

Is there anyone else, who has trouble with this?"

Fast forward down the track I was 14 and I was helping an ex who was a friend at the time cope with sucide and depression manly late nights spent trying to help her and we eventually dated I wanted to get out of the relationship but she found out and tried to kill herself I then stayed in the relationship ( I felt chained up) I started loving her again then she broke up with me two months later and she cut herself for braking up with me I was very confused and conflicted I then had to move schools due to me being threatened at the school ( being bashed and stabbed and all that) I lost many people o considered brothers and sisters I then moved to the school I’m at and i found someone else to date we dated for a year and a half and through our that whole relationship she manipulated and made me feel wrong ( there was a time because I kept getting hard whilst spooning and I told her I didn’t wanna do anything but she kept saying that’s not right there’s something wrong with you what’s wrong with you it got that bad I had to go to the doctors about it) she didn’t care enough in the relationship to read articles I found to describe my anxiety and made me feel worthless we ended the relationship about two months ago and I tried to kill myself because I was having an existential life crisis and tried to control how I died and I just wanted the mental pain to end I had to restart my friends again because she made me push them away I had to go to the emergency ward twice because I nearly killed myself I hate that I still love her when she was horrible to me and I offered her the world and it sucks that my family doesn’t understand me and my uncle said to me that I was trying to draw pity on myself and these where the reasons I closed up and when me and my ex broke up she told me she would be there for me and I believed her I told her what’s happening and she used my depression against me I feel so weak and worthless

depression,2020/01/24,"(17M) Identity Crisis, Am I Real? Hello everyone. I’d like to give you a heads up since this might be a sloppy post. I’ll write everything off the top of my head so that I won’t forget anything.

I am a 17 year old male living in Egypt and I am having an identity crisis. I am into music and movies heavily and I figure it changes my identity as a result. One day I could be a gentlemen like Frank Sinatra, one day I could be a mobster like Vito Corleone, one day I could be a gangster like Ice Cube, one day I could be a trap star like Travis Scott, and one day I could be a rockstar like Kurt Cobain. And surprisingly I find myself emerged into the identity of that person/genre/day, and I’d sing recite, and act just like that. For a 17 year old I have made my own music, which is on SoundCloud, and I’ve started my own clothing brand which abruptly failed but was an experience. I have always felt alone. I never had a girlfriend/a first kiss. Ive always been rejected and never had a lot of friends. For that reason I came across a lot free time to create and explore different crafts. Last night I went to my first ever party and realized how much of a loser I am. I am thin and small, and everyone at that party was big, looked, and acted like a chad. Not to mention that everyone had a woman. And I was just... me. Trying to fit in once again. Wishing I’d be home on my computer. I felt like a loser and a nobody. That’s when I figured why I get rejected. I’m no chad. I’m not interesting nor am I strong. And that’s when I also figured I have no identity. I jump from theme to theme but there is no me. I simply do not exist. It has gotten to the point where I am certain I’m in a dream, and I’m waiting to wake up. I am clueless where I want to go, who I want to be, or who I currently am. I lay here in bed in despair wishing I’d find the answer. 

I am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but I have no one else to talk to, and I wanted to get my feelings out."
depression,2020/01/24,"19M who has the voice of a 13F and it sucks. I’m okay, not suicidal or even hurt myself, but I just wanted to mostly see who has this same problem. Its just a really shit situation all together since I’ve been a kid. Always having that high pitches girl voice, even though I have been told by doctors and other friends I will grow out of it. It’s always been a problem online, with most people thinking I’m a “Egirl” and harassing me and some extreme cases of some of them thinking I’m a lady and hit on me(and unsolicited pictures). Ngl it’s nice to hear the compliments but I am a guy afterwards and I’m not transgender. I like my ladies, it just sucks that many people hear and think I am. It’s even come to a point a couple years ago I said fuck it and called myself “CrazyGrandma” and “YurTrannyGranny” cus why tf not. It’s been really bad lately with me being attacked, not respected and just all around nobody listening to me. If this is the bullshit you ladies out there experience online, I truly am sorry you have to suffer with it. It’s nice at-least I do have some lady friends online who know about it, but it’s just crazy how your voice can be such a judgement factor online."

depression,2020/01/26,"I am having a rough patch, no where near as bad as some have it. But I need to get it out somewhere. I (16M) don't know if this is the right sub for this or if I should also post somewhere else. This might get a little depressing, I am writing this first so IDK yet. If this is the incorrect sub and it is deleted by a moderator, can you leave a comment with a better suiting sub for this post to go to before you remove it. 

I apologise if this is just a mess, I kind of just needed to word vomit everything out, I am holding most of this in because I don't like talking to my parents about it (yet I am saying this to strangers on the internet)

I play a size-able amount of video games met through my competitive ""career"" (If you can call it that) as well as talk to a decent number of people who don't go to my school. I get along so well with all of these friends that when I think about my in school friends, there are really only about 4 or 5 I enjoy being around. Those school friends are all ones I really don't talk to as much I don't know why I love being around them so much more than with others. I have also recently taken a step back with my girlfriend due to her not wanting a full relationship right now \[Which I didn't really mind, but not all the way back to ""Just friends"" as she put it :( \]

I have basically given up on trying anything and have just accepted the friend-zone and begun to space myself a little bit so I don't feel too attached if she never comes back to me specifically. She told me I was the right person at the wrong time. I have a post up on r/relationship_advice if you want to read the specifics, it is a little bit outdated now but it gives most of the context.

I am also going to try and separate from a couple friends in which are creating un-needed worry/stress in my life so I can focus on the last two years of school (I'm from Australia). At school I feel happy, I think? Like I really don't know, I enjoy my time at lunch and recess with friends but it doesn't really feel like properly happy. When I am playing games with my online friends I really do feel happy, I enjoy my time, we talk about whatever when queuing for another match or when deciding what game to play or after we have played and wanna just chill. All of my good gamer friends follow me on Instagram (none of them are pedo's which was relieving) and we post pictures either for the hell of it or for whatever the reason be. The friends that I play games with always like and leave funny or kind comments as well as a few of my out of school friends. This makes me feel good about myself, whether they are doing it because they are just being nice or genuine I really just don't care. But my friends from school even when they are on Instagram at the time just ghost me. I am on good standing with all my friends besides the ones I previously mentioned am trying to get away from. I would say I am very much driven by complements, even if they are just hollow ones to encourage me. That why I have an issue with my school friends, but it really isn't a huge deal, its just pictures on Instagram not everyone is on there 24/7. Just hurts my feeling slightly when I see them online and I post my first picture in a while and they ignore it.

I wanna feel like I can do anything, and I did. When I was with my girl(friend) I always felt so happy and really enjoyed myself every time we spent time together. But now I feel like I am not being told the whole truth and don't really think talking more to her about it will help. But then again, maybe bringing it up will help, but it could also send us further apart, which I also don't want. UGH I DONT KNOW, I want to be with her but also feel like I shouldn't.

When I listen to music I only feel good listening to words with sad lyrics or hard drops/beats. If i'm not listening to music when I am just browsing the internet I feel sad, like I am not achieving anything whether I am reading about quantum mechanics or watching someone glue macaroni together. Even now whilst writing this I am listening to music, its making me motivated to write this and get it out there, but I feel like I get writers block in between songs it is hard to describe.

Why is it when I am with the people I know best, I feel so excluded despite being entirely involved with the conversation and having fun. Why is it that I don't know how to properly put how I feel into words. Why is it that I felt happy just a few weeks ago but now don't.  

Returning back to the friends portion of this post, I just feel so much closer to the friends I don't spend as much time with or see physically all the time. I don't know what else to say now!!?!!?!? FUIOBQEGU3W2B4GOUQBRO\[UGBSPGJI53489T0935402309IRFNWEIODFNOKJdfvsdfxvvdfvwerv12

I think I might have slight depression, or some other condition I don't know, I just feel so spaced from the people I am with the most.

This whole post is basically just a spam wall of all my thoughts at the moment and I apologise for that. I am going to post this now because I don't want to dwell on it too long or overthink and not end up posting it. I want input and advice."

depression,2020/01/26,"Lost my ex girlfriend (split 5 years ago) about half a year ago, cannot seem to 'get over it', and have never cried about it. Hi there, this is my first post here so I hope it's the right subreddit. I'm 17M, she was 17F.

September last year, a friend of mine who I've known my entire life died in her sleep, suddenly and totally unexpectedly. She had a reasonably good health, at least, people have lived well with worse health. When the news got to my family at 10PM, everyone was crying, everyone except for me. Me, the person who knew her at least 5 times better than my family ever did. Once, we had a 3 year long distance relationship stint. This ended when she came and visited me and at one stage without my consent, tried to give me a hand job. After that, we remained good friends. Excluding my family, I knew this person the longest out of everybody - lifelong friends, you might call it. Anyway, I didn't cry, and I figured it was shock. Well, it's been months, and the shock hasn't worn off. I've looked on the internet, and a lot of this seems to point to forms of depression. I normally can cry, so it's not as if I've had a longstanding issue. The closest I got to crying on the night we found out about her death was when I saw my mother. I was nearly crying tears for her, because I hate seeing my mum upset, but there was absolutely no feeling for the girl who had died. Since the death, I haven't cried, and I normally would cry, but I haven't. Is there a screw loose in my head? Please advise, or advise a subreddit if this isn't the right place.

TL;DR  
lifelong friend I have a complicated relationship with died unexpectedly and I have not cried, at all, ever since, so I'm worried it could be some kind of neurological development.

Thanks in advance"
depression,2020/01/27,Feel I’m about to toaster bath I’ve [16M] been depressed for a while but recently the depressive episodes have been more severe and frequent and I don’t know what to do. I’ve recently started self harming which I know is a terrible coping mechanism health wise but is literally the only way I’m able to cope right now. As much as I’d love to tell someone about it I don’t wanna let my family down or anything which I know is stupid as they’re really supportive and kind but obviously nobody wants a depressed suicidal kid and I don’t want to have to put them through that. I also wanna tell my friends however while they’re all kind I doubt they know how to react and they’re is kinda a stigma with depressed males from what I’ve seen. What really put it in perspective for me is when I was at a “party” and one of my female friends pointed out someone and told me how they’re depressed and self harm and I didn’t even know the guy. If I open up to people the last thing I want to happen is I become know as just the depressed kid that self harms so I’m kinda just as the point where I’m completely alone in this and everything’s kinda spiralling.
depression,2020/01/27,"How do I (21F) keep from becoming more depressed after being used? I'm pretty depressed to begin with - obviously, since I'm here. I thought things were looking up for a little bit but now I'm back down. 

For the last week or so I've been reconnecting with a guy (21M) I went to high school with. He works at the bar I go to, so we started talking and hanging out. He asked for nudes pretty early on and I sent them. I wasn't really expecting it to happen, but I slept with him pretty early on, too. I told him I'm not looking for a relationship, but if he ever wants to hang out, smoke, get a drink, etc., I'm down. But of course he's still blowing me off and I'm being ghosted. I know I was used, he's a jackass, shit happens, blah blah blah. Normally I can just move on and forget it, but something is making me linger on this more. I'm just so tired of shit like this happening. In the past couple months, I've been used by at least a few different men and it's genuinely making me depressed. I'm okay when I first start talking to them and I tend to have a pretty good time. Something makes it turn to shit and I wallow for too long. What can I do to move past this faster? I do wanna talk to him about it but there never seems to be a decent enough time. 

TLDR: I was used by a guy, yet again, and it's just making me so sad. What can I do to feel better faster? 
I already try going to the gym to help with my depression, and I have mixed feelings about telling this to my therapist"
depression,2020/01/27,"Partner is depressed, stopped having sex My partner (26M) and I (28F) have been together for over 3 years, and have lived together for 2 years.

Our sex life was absolutely amazing (the best I've ever experienced!), but the frequency of sex has decreased dramatically over the last year and it's making me very disconnected and unwanted. Especially since this has happened before with my ex of 5 years (I ended due to the lack of sexual intimacy). I began to resent my ex because I was rejected so often (and other reasons). However, it's different with my current boyfriend because he is such a great person, I'm incredibly attracted to him and respect him very much. He has undeservingly been through a lot over the past couple of years. 

He suffered the loss of two very close family members late 2017 and early 2019, and has been dealing with some financial difficulties which has had a negative impact on his mental health. He has gained some weight as a result of comfort eating and working long hours. He also dislikes his job at the moment.

It all started a year ago, when I walked into the living room wearing just lingerie, stockings and heels, sat down, looked at him and started playing with myself. Usually this would send him wild, but he just looked awkward and stared at the TV. We spoke and he said he didn't feel in the mood, felt awkward, and that he just doesn't feel good about himself lately, like weight, etc. Still, he made the effort and we would probably have sex once a week.

Fast forward to December 2020. We hadn't had sex in 3 weeks, so I came onto him. But he didn't want it. We talked and he said he is depressed, overweight and hates his job. He said it had nothing to do with me, but his own issues. He said that he dreads having sex, and feels very stressed about initiating it, or when I initiate it. He just doesn't have a sex drive at the moment. He said that he wants to go to the doctors to see if he has a hormonal imbalance. I said that I would let him work through it with no pressure. 

Sex aside, we have a committed, loving and playful relationship. I am very happy with this man, and I genuinely want to be there for him through everything. Now it's been 2 months since we've done anything sexual, and I'm naturally feeling insecure, undesirable, disconnected. It's hard that I'm not able to talk about it. I also can't talk about it with a friend because I feel it's disrespectful. It hurts that I can't help him with his depression. And I wonder if our sex life can ever go back to the way it was (I miss it!). This is out of my control so I feel like Im just waiting and hoping for change. Please can you give me some hope or helpful advice.

Tldr; Partner has become depressed, haven't had sex in 2 months, feeling unwanted, missing the chemistry, I haven't experienced depression so I want to understand it to help our relationship"
depression,2020/01/28,"Someone.. I'm 26M, I am pursuing my post graduation course which is very competitive like CFA,CPA. I have attempted and failed for 4times. My preparation were not even close where I feel that i deserved to pass. I had a toxic girlfriend who manipulated me badly which affectedy rational thinking. My father lives in a denial that everything is okay when he knows it's not and he is just living for the sake of it. He threw away all his savings in the stock market and 40years of service and has no property or savings to leave for his family. These things have affected me psychologically. I have constant headache in back of my head. I'm confused with what i should do. Had been smoke free for 4years 2months and picked it up a week back because alcohol gives me suicidal thoughts. 
I'm really worried about myself. I don't know what to do. I was the go to guy everywhere. Women used to admire me. I was the football star in school. I was happy really happy. Now i cant sleep as when I lie down it feels like someone is standing on my chest.

depression,2020/01/28,"Does anyone else have a self-determined ""expiration date?"" I've been depressed my whole life [25M] or at least as long as I can remember. When my life started to plummet at an exceptionally fast rate when I was 20, I told myself if I didn't turn things around in 10 years, I'd do everyone a favor and end things. The last 5 years have been nothing but stagnation, alienation, and further disappointment, so it seems I only have 5 years left.

depression,2020/01/29,"feeling extra depressed lately... suicidal thoughts cross my mind too frequently these days. Title says it all. I'm a 24M and recently got diagnosed with GHSV1 which is also a contributing factor to why i've been feeling so down lately. I've never really had much of a love life to begin with and so getting this diagnosis has been really hard on me. I just don't see the point in my life. I know I'm sure I have it better than others but, i'm in grad school right now taking out a 6 figure loan and studying for a job that i'm probably going to end up hating. I put up a front and smile on a daily basis but every time I come home I just start crying. Sometimes I don't even know why I cry, but I just start balling my eyes out. I have been having a very tough time lately, nothing seems to bring me joy anymore. I always write music as an escape but lately, I haven't been feeling anything from music. Studying is so hard for me because I'm always just feeling so down and unhappy and I feel like I'm constantly surrounded by people who are just so happy and have their shit together and I am so envious sometimes. I always think ""Why can't I be happy like that""? ""what do they have that I'm missing""? The only thing stopping me from taking my own life are my friends and family. I'm sure they would have it the hardest and I know it would be selfish of me to take my own life. I'm trying my hardest here and taking it a day at a time but it's really really hard. I don't know how much more of this I can take. Any advice would be appreciated."
depression,2020/01/29,"(20M) Losing Hope, Suicidal Thoughts Emerging Hey. 

I'm just a random sophomore male in college living in the United States. So what is my problem? I feel like I wasted my entire life. I know that might sound dramatic: but here is why.

I grew up in a suburban middle-class evangelical Christian family, to oversimplify things. We were — and still are, the present time — neither that particularly rich or poor. You get the general picture. I guess pretty sheltered from the world as well. But I was too socially incompetent to have done anything, regardless.

My time in (public) middle and high school can be generally characterized as a total waste. Teachers would always remark about how ""bright"" and ""lucid"" I was, but I could never grasp the nuances of social interaction — I have Aspergers— and thus spent the overwhelming majority of my time alone and away from others. Video games, books, and other forms of entertainment almost entirely consumed my time. I ended up with mediocre grades from anxiety and transferred into community college.

I always knew that my social isolation from others was atypical. But the full extent of my problems didn't hit until I realized awhile ago that the overwhelming majority of my peers are no longer virgins, partied, have developed stable social networks, and are much more mentally advanced socially than I am. I feel like a 13-year-old trapped in the body of someone far older. People my age want to go to parties, I've never even had a single (true) close friend in my life; people want sex, I just want someone to cuddle me. Etc. I'm not even on the same level.

It's left me all so insecure about myself. I cringe at the realization that I've spent my entire life nearly friendless, never in a relationship, totally alienated from my generation. And it feels like no one will never understand my problems.

I'm also deeply insecure about my own physical appearance; or, to put it more accurately, how people react to it. I get a strong sense of disgust every time I gaze upon my own reflection in the mirror. It's a topic that has caused me a great amount of self-hatred. I hate my appearance. A casual glance at a site like Snapchat or Instagram shows how attractive men and women get adoration, reverence, and praise from just merely existing. And me?  I've never been complimented on my appearance by a woman in my entire life.

It causes me to feel disgusting about myself. Like I'll never be viewed as attractive. It makes me feel ontologically inferior to them in some way. Or, that reality is just playing a sick joke upon us all. I can't help but feel a disgusted mix of sadness, envy, and repressed anger towards the world. It all feels so random, so meaningless, I've dwelt on it to the point of being cynical about whether love truly exists. They'll say that ""no one"" deserves love... which only makes me hate myself anymore.

My social skills are non-existent. I never learned how to communicate with others, impress women, etc. And the suggested ""help"" I've seen online from armchair commentators is even worse. Alone? Having trouble with the girls? Friends in general? They'll urge you to go after the hollowest, meaningless, and hedonistic things in existence. I see it now: someone in the comments is ready to recommend visiting a strip club, hiring a prostitute, or watching pornography on your computer. 

It's absolutely ridiculous. They just want you to shut up, keep repeating crap about how the world will ultimately work out for you, and wait for you to disappear from the face of it. I still don't know how people easily obtain friendships, etc. The notion of someone other than family particularly caring about me honestly seems totally surreal. Like a dream you'd come up to relieve yourself of sadness, then, cry as you realize that it is nothing more than such. I just want someone to cuddle up next me. I want to be loved. I want friends. And all of this seems forever out of my reach.

I'm also a kissless virgin who has never been in a relationship. But I'm not necessarily depressed about it for the reasons that might be typical among my peers. It's less about the sex than the idea of a women finding me desirable/important to her. And I feel like the world is implicitly telling me that I'm too ugly, insecure, and meaningless to be loved.

I'm not unintelligent from an academic/""book-knowledge"" mperspective. I turned my grades around once I got motivated in college. I'm currently riding with a 3.9 GPA as a sophomore. But it feels like elite schools like Harvard, Yale, etc. are now impossible for me to reach regardless of my efforts. Any chance of that perished with my miserable years in high school. My CC allows me to transfer to a top public university in our state... but the whole notion still kind of stings me. (Yeah, cry me a river and all of that.)

I always wanted to make music as a dream career. I can create epic songs in my head, etc. (I want to good at syntheizers... think synthwave) But I don't know if I'll have the time now to ever become close to perficient. I'vd barely picked up an instrument before now. So I don't even really know where to begin.

I'm uncertain what my career path in life will be after college. (I'm still taking prereqs now) I felt forced to go to college by my parents. Still don't have a job. Still don't have a driver's license. I don't even know if there is a good place for me to start off at.

I feel undesired, unwanted, and abandoned in a world that is either vindictive or uncaring about my entire existence. Being white, male, autistic, socially awkward, and a virgin all together at once carries a lot of negative connotations in modern day society. So I'm afraid of what people would wrongly presume about me if I told anyone this in real life. (that I'm sexist, dangerous, etc.)

I feel like the gap will make me inevitably disconnected from my peers. I have no idea what a 20 year old is supposed to have done by now. Do most people have friends? Do they go to parties? I'm utterly disconnected from experiences that all of my peers have already done. A lot of things that you are supposed to do as a teenager I utterly missed. I just sat, cried, and got bored in my room every day.

How the freakin' heck are you supposed to fix this in a relatively short period of time? I'll graduate in 2.5 years. It feels like 

I've missed the boat entirely.  I've never really had any close relations with my peers ever. Can you even fix your past?

I'm constantly overcome with the feeling of being unwanted and alone, that my chance of accel at my goals is now past, and that I should just lay over, rot, and die. Maybe I'll survive. Maybe I'll get a decent job. But I'd just be a wageslaving for the next 50 years all alone.

I just want to do something substantive in my life. To experience the world, to accomplish things, to be the most moral and outstanding person I can be, but I just fear that all of this has already passed.

Am I wrong? Any tips? Any recommendations? I feel like the days are going by.... and I'm doing nothing with them. Feel free to ask me anything about this. I'll respond relatively quickly.

I'm afraid of dying a cynical, bitter man who wasted their entire life. I'm already 1/4th of my way through my 20th year of life... and I have no idea how to talk to people. My childhood and adolescence is pretty much completely over. And I learned nothing from it.

If I'm 21 and things don't get better... I'm tempted to find a legal way to kill myself somewhere. I can't live like this."
depression,2020/01/29,"I feel like I'm making it up I (20M) recently took a leave of absence (aka. a fancy way to say dropped out) from college at the end of my 3rd semester. I felt like this year was going to be better and I started off well. I joined the volleyball team (a sport that helped me get my mind off of the outside world and just clear my head) and I started off with good grades. However, after the first month or so I sank into a pit and couldn't get myself out. 

I have always had a lack of motivation but recently (the past 3 years or so) I have found it hard to get out of bed some days and even then it would only be to get food or play video games. On most nights towards the end of the semester, and since then, I have had trouble sleeping due to thoughts of self worth running through my head. 

My family has always been supportive but I feel like my parents are getting more frustrated/disappointed with me and I feel like I'm letting them down. The biggest struggle is that I know I could get A's and B's if I tried but I can't find the motivation to get the work done which turns into a Catch 22 of getting bad grades and then feeling like I'm not going anywhere. 

I guess my real questions are:
How do I get motivated/work my way out of this and how do I talk to my parents about it?"

depression,2020/01/29,"Today is Bell Let’s Talk! in Canada and man it is bullshit So Bell a the largest telecommunications company in Canada and they are also some of the largest scumbags in our country. Bell takes government subsides but still over charges for their services, they don’t pay their fair share of taxes, they treat their employees and customers like shit.

Every year Bell does a “Bell let’s talk” day where they donate $0.05 for every interaction on social media and last year they got 145M interactions so they donated $7M which is peanuts for a company like them. All of this gives these scumbags a tax ride off and a day of cheap advertisement.

Now I expect scumbag mega corpartion to be scumbags but the worst is people that become so sympathetic all of a sudden. You see people that are dicks throughout the year post on Facebook about how if anyone is struggling with mental illness they are there for them and then they continue to be assholes for the rest of the year. This day truly pisses me off as Canadian who struggles with depression because it shows how fake everyone. Fuck Bell let’s talk and fuck anybody who tries to get in on this trend."

depression,2020/01/29,"I finally figured out what I needed Yesterday I had a moment of clarity, I decided to start going to counseling. I briefly attended counseling in college, but I wasn’t receptive and my counselor refused to see me. She felt that while I was there on my own free will, I was not ready to commit to the methods required to progress. 

I (24F) live with my boyfriend (26M) and am genuinely happy with him. However, I have started to feel that there is an imbalance. I know that no relationship is truly 50/50 in every aspect, but there is more balance that what I have been experiencing. The stress of work and school have started to get to me, and I’ve been having more bad days than good. He isn’t there to support me. I could be crying or spiraling out in silence and he is too busy on his phone or too “tired” to notice. I have given all of myself but gotten nothing in return it seems. 

I need help, and I wish it was from him. I need someone to hear my screaming for help, but it isn’t him. I need to start counseling to try and fix the broken parts of me because at the end of the day that’s all I can rely on: myself. 

I know this may not belong here, but my depression is what made me feel this way and come to this conclusion. I love my boyfriend but right now I need to love myself more."

I try to reach out, tell them my feelings but then it can't happen regularly, I mean why would they be willing to put so much efforts in me. I don't know I feel like I'm not worth it.

I have had social anxiety for as long as i remember but my father doesn't believe in mental illness so he always forced me to do stuff that i didn't want or couldn't do at all. I'm pretty sure that's one of the main reason i'm still depressed. He is also an alcoholic and everytime he drinks he comes into my room and fights with me. Over the years he has said a lot of things while being drunk out of his mind but the things he says while being completely sober hurts the most. In the last few years he has told me that ""it is embarrassing to tell my friends that you are my son"". So that's why i try my best to avoid him but today he told me that he has had enough and it would be better for everyone if i would just killed myself. I was already thinking about it for a few months now and it looks like i got my conformation."

I wouldn't say i am particularly sad, i am just nothing, i almost have no feeling at all. I literally feel like an empty vessel that does what it has to do, anyway going a little off topic there as ive finally decided i am to end my own life, i have ran out of reasons to carry on living, i have written notes to the people closest to me and im actually ready. I haven't been this sure of anything in a long time, it's an odd feeling tbh, i feel comfort from knowing this is going to be the end very soon, i know its contradictory but i almost feel happy. Its such a strange feeling.

I did have therapy, anti depressants, you name it ive tried it, nothing worked as i just think its as simple as i don't want to be here anymore.

Im sorry for posting something like this but i wanted to share my thoughts with someone that isn't to close too me, feels like closure really.

depression,2020/02/01,"Pregnant and not feeling my best self I (33F) have been married (34M) for 8 years.  We have 2 kids (8 yr old boy and a 2 yr old girl).  I am currently 7 months with baby #3, a girl.  I didn't necessarily enjoy being pregnant with any of my children but I have just been down right not myself with pregnancy #3.  I have pulled away from family, friends, and people at work, I have lost interest in just about everything.  I sleep all the time (although that could be pregnant exhaution).  I am also a very neat, picky, and clean person and I just cannot find the urge to keep the house kept.  I have tried my hardest to get out of this slump.  I have talked to my mom, husband, and confided in a close coworker about my feelings just so they know what is going on.  Although the people that see me everyday have already asked if I was alright.

I have also felt very insecure.  Insecure as a parent, a worker, a spouse. It's been building and getting worse.  I don't like it and I dont know how to stop it.  I haven't felt good (morning sickness, tired, swollen, unattractive) and then the not feeling good started messing with me mentally. My mind has really went to some wierd and dark places but im pretty sure most of it is literally all made up stuff in my mind.  No merit to any of it.  Just insecurities brought on by not feeling well and trying to just push through.  I feel like I'm typically a pretty confident, bubbly, and playful person but I havent been lately.  I'm trying to brighten my mood by doing stuff I like ... started with cooking different and new foods for my family.  My friend bought me a seasonal depression light.  I bought some toys for me an hubby to try with ""alone time"" and it has helped a little and I noticed my spark coming back.  

Then tonight, the light started to dim again.  My husband made a silly comment about checking out other women, he has been out of town for a week (last night was his first night back) and again, I am confident, not a jealous person, and I also will check out women with him but I took it personal this time.  I didn't say anything but it stung a little, especially considering I'm feeling a bit like a whale these days.  My self worth is distorted and I'm doing my best to not let my inaccurate ideals and insecurities seep into the real world but they are.  I just want to be bubbly playful me again.  I'm starting to feel like maybe I cant do this all by myself.

Any advice to conquer this is welcome."

NO HOT WOMEN LIKE ME

I'm miserable about how attractive women don't want me and I'm miserable that I'm broke and poor living with my father. I'm 26 never a girlfriend or kissed still a virgin. I'm fat ugly short and poor. I'm frustrated and miserable and stressed. Nobody loves me.
My best friend is about to become a pharmacist and his girlfriend is unreal hot and my other close friend has just gotten in with a very big firm and it's going to make a hundred grand a year and his girlfriend is ridiculous hot and I'm 26 and I'm just now halfway towards my bachelor's and I'm on academic probation so it feels like I've ruined my life already cuz I'm so far behind compared to everybody else.Hot girls don't date fat dudes who live with their dad. I also work for my dad as a salesman because I don't want to push carts at a grocery store. And attractive women don't date cart pushers. 

Where I grew up in Colorado all the girls thought I was a loser and when I hung out with my friends my friends girlfriends think I'm a loser and it is because I'm ugly looking and fat.
 I now live in Massachusetts and I'm practically invisible to good looking women and I also don't have any friends here and I've lived here for 7 years I only have friends because I keep tabs and visit my once in Colorado.

26M Never a girlfriend or kissed still a virgin never a date I'm fat ugly short and poor. No decent women (20sF) like me. Nobody cares that I am miserable and no one wants to help me and no one cares about me. Can I get advice? Can I get honest opinions on my looks please? How ugly am I?

depression,2020/02/02,"HELPPP My (23M) girlfriend (22F) suffers with severe depression, she's on medications, lately she's been acting a bit distant to me, when she's feeling low she doesn't want to meet up. Short replies, not interested in anything, doesn't want to hurt me and I don't want to hurt her. She tells me when she feels bad but tells me she feels blank and doesn't want to leave house to meet up with me. She trusts me and I trust her but I want to do something to help her. I asked if there's anything she wants and she doesn't want anything, we took a break from ourselves but I'm not sure if that's a good idea now that I think about it... Im not sure if I should be there for her, and text or call even if she doesn't feel like meeting up. It hurts me like hell when I can't even text her or check up on her. Any advice is greatly appreciated."
depression,2020/02/03,"I’m in a heartbreaking situation This will be quite long so hold your horses guys :)

Me (19M) and my Nepali GF (18F) have been together for three months as College Freshmen. She’s better than I thought. With the Spring term arriving, I’m financially unable to attend my current four-year institution . So, I have to transfer to a community college that’s 3 hrs away near my hometown. I’m able to return in the Fall, though. She and her friends are going back home to Nepal for the summer &amp; they’ll be back in the U.S around August. I plan on returning to my current four year by that time, but not specifically for these reasons only. School wise, my career pathway is going great. However, my concern is that my GF will have another guy in her life once I return. What if she friend zones me when I come back? Obviously, Idk what her love life will be like &amp; I know I sound like a controlling &amp; paranoid BF, but I’m wondering if I should move on to another girl &amp; hope we can be back together once I return. 

7 months is so fucking long, I don’t want to lose what I have because my happiness has never been this high before. I don’t want to live in the past, that’s why I moved far away to college. Being with a girl who will wake up early in the morning to drive through a blizzard just to buy you cough medicine is something I truly cherish because I’ve never met one who’d do that. I asked her why she did it, she says “I care about you more than you care about your health.” Was I in a dream? There’s actually someone who loves me like this? 

This is so rare that I don’t want to leave her. Once I broke the news to her, she starting bawling her eyes like a faucet telling me that “She won’t ever find a guy like me again.” And I’ll never find a girl as good as her. I don’t know it now, but my depression is going to hit me like a bus within a week. I feel like my identity &amp; life have truly been revoked. To be honest, I’ve never felt such a genuine connection with any girl in my life. Last night I was with her and we partied our asses off. We got hammered and it was just her and I on the dance floor. The whole bar (of 70 people) we’re watching us dance like AARP members. She looked me in the eyes and drunkly said, “Any girl would be lucky to have you babe. Don’t fucking forget me okay? I don’t want you to leave because I still really love you.” Then she started crying again. I cant believe I have to leave the very people who care for me the most. Life’s too good for this to change. I can really be myself for once.....finally. I had just gotten to know her other Nepali friends. We’d go partying and cook dinner together. They enjoy my company &amp; treat me like family. Being around people who actually give a shit about you is something that I hardly experienced. In the past, I always had to act a certain way to make friends, but these people make me feel human for once. 

I make them laugh &amp; they pull a few pranks on me too.  For once in my life, I have finally reached a state of happiness that has been gone for so unbelievably long. Seeing her smile when I wake up in the morning gives me reason to enjoy life again. I don’t want to drive away from my new life. I love my school, campus pride, and friends. I don’t want to be a forgotten memory to them. Being with her and spending time with her friends makes me feel alive. Now, I have to leave it all behind without getting to truly bond and make more memories with them. In H.S I was basically alone. Now, my faith in God is fucking gone. I just want to be happy for once, cut me a fucking break and stop torturing me. This is too much for me. 

What are your thoughts? :)"
depression,2020/02/03,"How I [25M] Turned my life upside down *LONG* Hey guys.. Not sure if this is the right sub but I've been eating myself alive and just need to get this off my plate.

I guess it starts back in 2011 when I met my (now) Ex [25f today] girlfriend. We were perfect for eachother. We shared the same hobbies, music tastes, world views etc. We had a great relationship for the most part.

Eventually her depression and anxiety started acting up more and more. This led to little to no intimate encounters between us for quite some time. I was patient because I knew she was struggling, but I also craved affection and intimacy. This was one of our big problems. She didn't have the confidence to initiate anything physical so I was always the one starting things, unsure of whether she was even interested or not.

Eventually this took a toll on my self esteem and I wondered if I was good enough or if I was the wrong type of guy etc. This was happening after about 2 years, for a time referance. 

Looking back I could've been more secure about the whole thing, but I was younger and less secure myself.

My exs mental health kept getting worse and worse until the doctors figured she may have bi polar. She tried a ton of different meds and nothing was working. Some things made it worse actually. She started self harming again, and began drinking copious amounts of vodka.

That's when the alcohol started. She lived with her parents, and would down a .26 of vodka in her room by herself. She would go through at least a couple per week. That's a lot of alcohol for a 5'4 110lb body to handle.

Naturally this took a huge mental toll on me. Why wasn't I good enough to stop this from happening? I tried my hardest to make her happy and comfortable. It never felt like it worked and I always beat myself up for it.

This continued for a few more years. Eventually the doctors thought maybe she has BPD and not bipolar. The guessing game and the changing medicine changes continued.

Throughout all of this I felt so focused on her problems rather than the stress and my needing to be loved that eventually I ""lost the spark""

I wasn't getting the affection and love I so desperately craved. I know it's selfish because she was going through so much, but you have to imagine how that effected me to watch the woman I love crash and burn and turn into an empty vessel.

That brings us to around Christmas time 1 year ago from now. She had a little too much to drink one night (even though I tried telling her not to drink at all) and she basicly had a psychotic episode. She was crying, running away, trying to walk around the city alone at night, almost getting picked up by some random dude until my brother found her.

I started talking to her trying to find out what was going on- through the mumbles and crying I found out she thought I was upset with her, and then she told me a secret from when she was a kid that I had never heard in our 8 years together. She said there was some dark history between her babysitter and herself. This was huge to me. Obviously I was upset and wished I could find this guy. I just comforted her and we went to bed. It hurt to not know about this after being together for so long but I understand that would be a hard topic to bring up. 

A few months before that Christmas season, I had taken a liking to a coworker [21f] at the time. She was very kind outgoing and loving person. Basicly everything I didn't have at the time, and was desperate for.

I started having feelings for her and I knew it was wrong so I avoided her at all costs and hoped that stupid crush would fade. I just wanted to see my ex get better but after 8 years of this I was exhausted and broken down.

Eventually I decided I couldn't be with my ex anymore. I wanted it to work, but it wasn't going anywhere and I have to worry about myself too. Plus it wasn't fair to be emotionally cheating.

So I ended the relationship around January 6 2019. I then perused my coworker almost immediately. In hindsight this wasn't a good idea at all because I had plenty of healing to do, whether I knew it or not.

So me and the co worker end up together not even a week later, and things seem fine. A little different, guilty and weird, but fine. In April, I got an email from an old employer offering me a job about 8 hours drive from my hometown. I decided to take the job, and my new girlfriend decided she would move with me! We are in love and it was a very bold move on her part to move to a new area with me after being together only 4 months.

Things are going pretty good over the summer, but there's a few days where I really start to wonder what the hell I've done to my life. I start to miss my ex and feel awful for abandoning her.  I look back at how fast I moved from an 8 year relationship into a new one and it scares me. Me and my new girlfriend and great together but it still scares me.

The thoughts get more and more frequent until the point I'm almost sending my ex an apology text. Not in hopes of trying to rekindle our relationship, just to genuinely apologize and tell her I feel like shit and she didn't deserve to be abandoned etc.

Then the dreams start. I have dreams of my ex a few times per week and it always ruins my day after.. I feel like I have un healed trauma and I don't know what to do.

To make matters worse, I can tell my family gets along with my new gf much better than my old one. She is already close with my mother. 

I feel like the bad guy in this situation so I'm not looking for sympathy I just had to let this all out. It's not the most organized post but I hope someone can read this and give me some advice. Thanks a lot for taking the time to read this far.

TL;DR 
broke up with gf of 8 years, got a new gf after a week, moved 8 hours away, realizing it was too fast and I'm still broken, need advice on what to do next."

depression,2020/02/03,"I feel worthless because of my height (5’2) I, a (20M) college student, haven’t had a friend since high school. I spend most of my days waking up, going to class and sleeping without any human interaction. I try my best to be outgoing but no one seems to want to be around me. Doing basic things like going to the dining hall is especially hard because seeing people my age with friends, laughing over a meal is painful. I try to convince myself that my lack of friends is not because I’m short and ugly, but I have no other explanation for it. I feel like if I died suddenly, no one would care - considering that no one cares about me when I’m alive."

I'm 20 years old and I've never really been happy with anything in my life. I tried college, hated it. I've had a total of 7 different jobs since I started working at 16 and I hated all of them. I'm in a long term serious relationship with someone I think I love but even that has been boring lately. I don't think he cares if I were to leave, we've broken up before and he's pretty good to take care of himself on his own.

I was in the hospital a little while ago because my heart and lungs have been acting up but nobody was able to diagnose me with anything. It's hard to breathe at night and I'm always in pain and I'm really hoping it hurries up and kills me. (I've been too apathetic to commit suicide. Maybe. Or I'm waiting for something good to happen.)

I'm just taking up space and wasting my time right now. Everything feels exhausting and pointless. I know more people are disappointed in me than not; that's not a theory or imposter syndrome, it's just the truth. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on books because it gives me a little bit of a distraction from my life.

I hate going to bed at night because it just means I have to wake up the next morning and do everything over again."
depression,2020/02/04,"Considering murdering someone to avoid homelessness. Hey all, 23M and stuck in a hole I'm afraid i'll never climb out of. I still live at home with my mother, whose health is deteriorating rapidly as she had me very late - in her 40s. She'll probably have to be put in a home soon, which means I'm likely to end up homeless in the next few years, and there is nowhere for me to stay (I'm an only child, grandparents are dead and I've got 0 friends. 10 year wait for city housing!)

The problem is that I got no income coming in (was denied welfare and disability) and neither does my moms, as she uses it to pay all the bills. I can't get a job as I dropped out of high school from depression, and even then I wouldn't be able to hold down an interview anyway, thanks to my severe anxiety. I don't even have a drivers license. I rarely go outside, and when I do its only when I'm going shopping with moms. I can't leave the house alone due to my debilitating anxiety, and I've no money to get help.

You see, I've strongly considered stabbing someone to death just so I can go to prison and not worry about sleeping on the streets in -40F weather. In prison I'll be able to socialize with like-minded people and even get an education. There's nothing for me in the real world-nothing."
depression,2020/02/05,"I have a toxic situation waiting for me back home... what do I do ? I (22F) live in a foreign country in Europe since 2017. I came to the country to study for 3 years so by October 2020 I have to leave the country unless my situation change.

I was happy to leave my country since my family is very toxic : my mother hate my father, my father loves my mother 10% of the time and my brother (19M) blames me for his failure in life (he thinks that I used all the money that my parents had to go to university witch is not true at all) and though he beats my father and my mother on a daily basis.

The abuse from my brother started when he was a teenager, he would beat my father and mother for simple things like telling him to do his homework.

He attempted suicide many times and wanted to kill me and my family many times (he wanted to disfigure me with a knife and wanted to kill my parents because they failed him)

According to him, they love me more so they spent everything they have for my education and they forgot about him. The truth of the matter is that he
 never wanted to study since a young age and with my parents forcing him to study he became very violent and thus did not propose to him extra classes like they did to me because he was not attending the normal mandatory ones and my family didn't have money to throw.

The problem is that I finished my studies and I will be obligated to go back hom on October of this year and it gives nightmares to think that I will be under the same roof as him.

Moving out of he is not an option since my home country is a muslim country and girls are not allowed to live alone and no I can't bring my parents to live with me if I purchase an apartment because they don't want to leave the house to my brother.

I just feel like wanting to attempt suicide everytime that I think about what's waiting for me back home.

I don't know what I should do..."
depression,2020/02/05,"What is the most self-destructive thing you have done due to your depression, in terms of a romantic relationship? I (38M) have no experience with depression myself, but I dated someone (36F) who suffered her whole life. Together 8 years, engaged, 95% of the time she was a great partner. On our 8th anniversary, she said she needed space, then slept with our mutual friend a few days later. Objectively speaking, our friend was gross, so all of our other friends suggested she did it because she knew it was something she ""couldn't take back.""

My brain is very logical and evidence based. Has anyone here done something similar due to their depression? Did you ever try to fix it? This happened to me 3 years ago. I fought for her for a while after it happened, but she never responded and has never reached out to me. She also has incredible pride, which I hear is common among those with depression, so I think it was a combination of those two things.

I am not asking for your experiences as a way of giving me hope, I have none of that, lol. Just emotionally and intellectually curious so that MAYBE I can understand and empathize a little better."

depression,2020/02/06,"I feel lost i really don't know what to do right now, can someone help?  

My (19F) girlfriend broke up with me (20M) about a week ago and I have lost all motivation to do anything, fell behind in school work, and keep having panic attacks and no one to talk to.

Sorry if this is worded poorly I am currently freaking out as I type this. So we were together for 2 years and have broken up in the past for similar reasons only for a little more than a week I think, I honestly don't remember. She basically says that I smother her and am too needy. She is away at college about 2 hours away from me. I know I was insecure and I would call her all the time and if she was busy I would feel like she just didn't want to talk to me so I would get insecure about that and if she went out I would ask too many questions about who is going and what not. She didn't think I trusted her, I don't think that is how I felt, I think I just love her too much and was scared to lose her. I went to therapy and it made me realize why I did all those things and that it was a deep issue that came from my childhood.

She still loves me, she keeps telling me that, and she said she is open to getting back together in the future. Although she also says she wants to fully let me go to work on her self because she has a lot of stressful things going on in her life. She has problems with her health, mental and physical, and she is seeking help for these things and I feel so bad that I wasn't there for her the way I feel I could have been. She had anger problems that would start petty arguments a lot and was probably triggered by my insecurities. But deep down to my core I love this girl with all my fucking heart and soul. I can't understand if she still loves me how she can just leave me like this. She said we can talk over coffee when she gets back for spring break in about a month but I don't know what to do. I feel as though now I realize how depressed I was. I have no motivation for anything right now, all I have been doing is hanging out with friends because I am scared to be by myself. I just want to be happy and I am scared that I dont have the motivation to do something about it right now. Everytime I have a panic attack I want to call her but I know that will just push her away even more. I want her back more than anything in the world but I am confused on how possible that is, I don't want to move on before I even get the chance to talk to her in person and see how we stand then. But the pain of waiting for that is unbearable. I have to wait almost a week to see my therapist again. My friends are in relationships so they can only do so much. And my other friends are at college or online where I play games with them. I feel like I just can't enjoy being by myself. I am so scared. And I am in so much pain right now. It feels like there is a pressure in my chest constantly. Any advice or thoughts are much appreciated."
depression,2020/02/07,"Empty I (21M) have been so deeply empty and apathetic for the past 4 years. Growing up, I was always super sensitive to how other people feel - I hated people being left out, made fun of or just feeling upset in general. Life was so colourful and full of emotion and feeling, all of which I have pretty much lost? I've lost interest in literally everything and if it wasn't for the tiniest bit of hope that things will change, there'd be no point in living as at this point I feel dead inside. I have no energy and have lost my sex drive which is almost non existent now. Some days I'm much lower than normal and try to cry as some sort of outlet but I can't. A lot of people still feel anger but even that doesn't seem to exist for me.

I rarely drink and don't smoke weed, although I used to smoke once every 4-6 months, so very rarely.

I smoked for the first time in a long time about 4 months ago and holy shit I felt like my old self. I was so overwhelmed by this alien yet familiar feeling of what it was like to be me, something i had thought was no longer in me. I cried so hard for about an hour. I felt every single emotion so powerfully which was also very overwhelming, I hadn't felt them in YEARS. It was like my mind had been switched off for the past 4 years and I had finally woke up. It was probably the most amazing day of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

After that experience I haven't smoked since as I decided I would finally open up and get help. I went to see my GP and have since been on 100mg of Sertraline (started off at 50 for the first 4 weeks. I've been on the medication for 12 weeks now and it has done nothing for me so far, i still feel as empty and meaningless. I have another appointment soon so I'll try a dose increase to 150mg. I really hope Sertraline at a higher dose helps because if not then I give up on medication."
depression,2020/02/07,"Suicidal thoughts and relationships Around 8 years or so ago, I \[26M at the time\] entered into a pretty serious period of depression (physical health related, mostly). Roughly three years after that, I attempted suicide multiple times. I'm talking serious, planned and thoroughly researched methods.

I was with a long-term partner for most of that time \[25F\], although the attempts themselves only came after we'd split it. It wasn't the breakup that tipped me over the edge. Rather, the breakup was the opportunity I'd been waiting for -- taking my own life while in a relationship seems to me to be a cruel thing to do.

As it turned out, I can now see that the relationship dysfunctional, depression aside, and I can't believe it took us 5 years to work that out. But the whole experience has totally changed me.

I'm far from that mindset now. Yet I'm very rarely grateful to be still alive I can think of no particularly good reason to go on living, as I find much of life a chore. This is despite the fact that objectively all is good and well: I eat well, have plenty of friends and hobbies, live communally with 8 wonderful people, and have a relatively comfortable academic research job (in well-being and sustainability, ironically). I'm currently on holiday for 6 weeks running up mountains ffs.

So here is my dilemma. Having been so close to taking my own life, and knowing that I'm still quite indifferent about my future, I think there's a significant chance that I will end up seriously trying to end my life again in the future. And so I've pretty much closed myself off to romance (and am perhaps a little guarded more broadly), despite craving intimacy deeply, because it seems unfair to bring anyone else into that situation. And that sucks for me, too.

Honestly, I don't know how this will change. How could I *ever* be sure that I won't end up that seriously suicidal again? And if that's true, how can I ever commit to someone as fully as they would like? Yet closing myself off this way means I'm missing out on some of life's more meaningful experiences, which of course leaves me more likely to sink very deeply into depression again.

It seems an insolvable dilemma, unless, of course, a find someone with almost the same history and outlook as me, such that we understood each other well enough to let whatever happens happen, without shouldering the blame.

Can anyone else relate? (I'm afraid I can't think of a more specific question...)

TL;DR:

For people that have seriously attempted suicide before, can you be totally sure you won't go to that place again? And if not, how can you fully commit to relationships, particularly of the romantic kind?"
depression,2020/02/08,"Why does it keep happening?  I (25M) haven't had any relationships for almost three years now. I'm going through serious depression, which was partially caused by me not being able to find any woman, who'd be interested in me. I was on dating apps, where I didn't have any success. I tried to meet someone offline - nothing. At some point, I just stopped any efforts. Then, when I started to feel a bit better mentally (last year) and found that it was so easy for me to talk to people and with women in particular. But nothing changed - I still had no dates, no relationships, nothing even close to that. One time, when I asked a woman out, and she ran away from me, it just broke me. I just stopped trying altogether. I felt like I'm some kind of creep, that I'm the person that other people want to stay away from. I tried to find, why does it happening, but I can't. I had a date recently, someone I met online after I decided to give it another shot. She just disappeared after that date, which was a complete surprise because I thought that everything went at least fine. I can't understand, why does it keep happening? Why do people run away from me, disappear after the first time they meet me in person? Is it my life now - constant loneliness and being treated as a danger? And why do they need to smile me in the face only to run away after that? It takes me some time to rehabilitate after every time I get rejected like that, and the moment I get some confidence in myself and some desire to try again, I just get rejected again. And it keeps going on and on"

“Why am I doing a course I don’t really enjoy?”
“Should I drop out?”
“Why can’t I hang out as much?”
“Why am I making zero progress in the gym when I’m still fat?” (Bit ironic considering I just ate KFC lol)
“My life’s been in a downward spiral since 2015”
“Should I end it all?”

The list goes on. I went on Twitter to complain about it. I got some supportive messages telling me to keep my head up and I found that to be no good because I’m not an optimist. One friend told me he was in my exact same position but said things do change. I wanted to believe him but I just couldn’t buy it. But suddenly I got a message from a friend who said, word for word:

“would you ever fucking give over feeling sorry for yourself and get a grip like hahahah”

“like i love you but why do you all ways complain like what’s the point pal”

First I found it to be a really negative response, like this guy didn’t support me at all. But then it hit me. I’ve been doing this a lot. Going on Twitter/social media to complain about my social life, my uni, my gym life, etc. Almost all the time. Usually they don’t get responses like the last one. But this one did. My friend was fed with me being soppy. And it was him being brutally honest. And I needed that.

You see because, I wasn’t depressed during the day like I was last night. I was waiting if my job interview was successful and I’d start a job ASAP, I went to a vigorous gym class, and expected to own the car my sister drove before getting a new one. I was happy. But one night somehow got me from anticipation to proper pessimism. And my friend telling me to “get a grip” actually helped me.  I think my friends are all sick of it too, disguising their hate towards my habit into something supportive. For how long it will help me is the question now before I fall into the same pit again."
depression,2020/02/09,"My life is a shitshow I’m not the most social guy in the world (20M) but if I can I’ll talk to people. I’d make “friends” who always say that they’ll be there for me but whenever they have a situation that needs advice they make me feel like I’m obligated to help them but when I try to talk to someone about the bullshit that goes on in my life (parents divorce, constantly being rejected, low self esteem, forcefully acts as the mature one in the family) they just essentially tell me to man up and get over it. Today (2/8/2020) I was supposed to hang out with someone i thought of as a sister but she completely forgets and stands me up. It hurts the most because everyone I’ve wanted to talk to and hang out with stood me up which led me to not wanting to make friendships. Everyone takes advantage of my kindness and it has further lowered my self esteem and self worth. This is probably not something that belongs on r/depression but I slowly have felt that since this happened I’ve developed depression of some kind. I just want a friend. I’ve always wanted a girlfriend but I just want a friend. Someone that will actually listen and not take advantage of my kindness"
depression,2020/02/10,"Feel horrible at one moment fine another. I(18M) moved to Texas from New York two years ago with my parents and my mental state has been declining since. I am a senior in HS planning to move back in June. Ever since junior year I had been feeling quite apathetic but this year has gotten much worse. I get episodes, usually in school, where I feel so lonely and hopeless but they go away once I am distracted by other people. I also get random anxiety. I have no friends, no physical contact or affection with others , and no sense of fulfillment. I feel like everything I'm doing is pointless. I really want human connection outside of family, but I'm not very good socially in large social groups and my school has 3000 students(one of the reasons I don't have friends in Tx), in perspective my old school had only 500.  Even the escapes I used to keep me from feeling too bad (watching anime) aren't entertaining anymore. The only things keeping me going is the prospect of moving back to New York, where all my friends, FWB, and dad are, and cooking which gives me a temporary reprieve from my emotions(very calming). I feel like I can't tell my mom how I'm feeling because my dad suffered from anxiety and depression so badly that he had to go to a psychiatric hospital(he has borderline personality disorder) and I don't want her to worry about me and think the same thing will happen to me. Plus i don't want her to feel bad about moving me out of my NY, the catalyst for the way I'm feeling. Just wanted to get this out cuz I haven't told anyone yet, if you have advice it would be nice. Sorry if I wrote this bad, I'm not good at writing or expressing my feelings."
depression,2020/02/10,"So... I've been robbed of my suicidal thoughts, I guess. I (27M) have been depressed and suicidal for as long as I can remember. First memory was when I was 7, telling my mother I wished I was dead.

I have been very slowly getting up from that, through friends that I started having what 21, first gf at 22 (she told me I could never be loved so there's that) and so on... I still felt like shit though, I had moments that didn't make sense, like me isolating myself and crying while counting the reasons I had to kill myself an reasons to not, and doing that after leaving a party with friends, nothing went wrong but I just felt no connection and I felt fake.

Anyway, i.'ve been really close to the line and I have been burrowing myself into work as to avoid thinking about my life. I was still trying hard, joining groups, having relation with people and so on. I did sport and associative work and going out with people. I did all that with the thought that eventually things would be good. It didn't.

Recently, I met a girl, it had been a very long time since I had but anyway, we matched very well. She confessed to me and I felt the same way. I don't know about the future, but for now I feel actually good, never felt like it, never in my life... It is kinda weird...

When I realized that I started crying. I felt somewhat robbed of my suicidal thoughts, I thought she had unwillingly given me a reason to live. I didn't want it but still it was there. I cried uncontrollably for a moment, then I was all right.

I felt like sharing that."

I’m a little used to feeling off around this time of year. This year though it seems a little different, it’s intensified definitely this time around. I’ve also been getting what i believe is anxiety attacks somewhat frequently. It’s been about 2ish months and I’m becoming worried about it. It’s been causing problems in my relationships with my family friends and girlfriend, work, and social life in general. I’ve noticed it’s worse this year because before it would just be a constant feeling of being down. This time it’s that’s on top of some messed up thoughts, snapping at people, no concentration, and a complete withdrawal from everything I once loved to do. I get this anxiety episodes where my heart will start pounding and i’m worrying about absolutely nothing and i find my self wanting to just go lay in my bed. I personally can’t find a trigger to these episodes. I’ve learned that coffee doesn’t help at all lol. I don’t really want to or know if I should see a doctor, I don’t want to have some drugs they give me to “feel better”. So i guess i’m looking for some sort of advice maybe or a little guidance on what could help with these things. I just feel so hopeless this year and don’t know who to talk about it with."

I thought someone there has had this issue when they were younger and they could maybe tell me some advice. instead i’m talked to like i’m 8 years old or just made fun of because i was a 15 year old asking for help. reddit is normally my safe space for asking for advice and now even that feels unsafe to me."

I’m 24M, I’ve been in Army intelligence, contracted with the DoD with Cyber Security, and now run my own construction business. I absolutely hate my life. I live day to day with seemingly no purpose. Our existence if practically for nothing. You can never experience happiness, just pain. If you do experience happiness, it’s maybe a 5 percent of the time while the other 95 percent is nothingness or sadness. I feel like I’ve been here long enough and don’t want to exist. The only reason I haven’t ended myself is the fear of failing and being vegetative my entire life. Everyone around me sees me as this young successful guy who is smart and has everything going for him. It’s not the case. I can’t even do anything I used to love. I can’t focus on anything for more than 5 minutes - and that’s not being dramatic. I’ll turn on my PS4, start a game, and close it before it even opened and turn off my PS4 and walk away. Sometimes I’ll walk right back and do it again. Or I’ll start my computer and open my browser just to close it and walk away. I have a mental barrier against life. I’m starting to ignore important financial issues, and sincerely don’t even care anymore. I could be robbed of everything I ever had and I wouldn’t feel any different. At this point, I don’t even know if I want help - because one you have this illusion that everything is “all right” you practically are just gliding through existence waiting on the next reminder that we nothing. Fuck this"
depression,2020/02/12,"I feel such a useless and a shitty person for not able to support my boyfriend better. I (19F) have a boyfriend who is depressed (20M). We've been together for almost a year now (tomorrow is our anniversary) and I do my best to give him light whenever his depression attacks. But everytime he's in his 'episodes' he refuses to listen to every positive thing i say about him and the solutions i give him. He just turns everything i say to him upsidedown. He said that I do not have the right to feel depressed as everything has been always been working for me.

This just made me feel so useless as i cant make him feel any better. I resorted to cutting my leg, and most recently my wrist. I also tried to overdose myself with sleeping medication as i dont think im worthy enough to live."
depression,2020/02/12,"I’m Not Sure Now this post won’t be as near as close to what I normally see on here, so if you’re more inclined to help people who actually need it, move on.  I’m not suicidal or anything like that.  

Anyway, I [18M] just feel my life isn’t that great anymore.  I used to say I had the best life.  I have two loving parents a goofy little brother; they all support me in college.  Ever since I moved away I feel like we aren’t as close.  I call my mom every day, but we used to talk for hours about everything.  My 7 close high school friends and I mostly went different ways, but I still have my girlfriend here at university whom I live with.  My relationship with my girlfriend is great although my libido has dropped because of my other problems.  

I recently got a 57 on my first Calc 2 exam which I still don’t understand why because I never guessed and got an answer for every question.  I feel like I was cheated, but it doesn’t matter because there’s barely room for error for me to even get a B- now.  My work is okay, but it’s taken me away from studies and because of that I have to compensate and only can’t do anything fun.  It’s school, homework, work: repeat.  Because I don’t have time for games anymore, I don’t have time to play with my friends who are no longer near me.  We have a Snapchat group chat that I try to keep alive, but it isn’t like it used to be.  My best friend and I haven’t talked for nearly a month now except by passively in the group chat.  I don’t even understand why.  And I’ve directly addressed it twice now.  He just won’t respond.  I’ve been so busy I haven’t found a good time to force him to talk about it which might even be the problem, but he came back from Chicago (he joined the Navy and is in school there) for Christmas and I thought that we had a big heart to heart, but he clearly didn’t see it the same.  

I don’t know, I just feel like my life fell apart in less than a year.  The worst part about it?  I’m apathetic and indifferent towards all of these problems because I don’t know if I can fix them. I also haven’t had earbuds for a week.  Not really important, but kinda sad.  No music.  😔

tl;dr I’m just sad."
depression,2020/02/12,"Bump in the Road Hi.

Little Background: I am 28M, struggling with depression for most of my life but always managed to come through. I was at the brink of suicide and occasionaly have suicidal thoughts but for me, my friends and the future i might have I would never do it.

I finished school with my Abitur (Highest school gaduation in Germany) from which I tried to study and find my own way. I managed to settle in being a physical therapist. During that time I married and divorced (was an ugly breakup). I found new hobbies and kept old firends. I found new love and moved 600km away from my home.

And now the actual Bump:

2 days ago, after a lenghty talk, my GF and I broke up. I moved here because of her and because I wanted out of the City I grew up in because of a lot of bad memories. The breakup was more or less mutual. The relationship felt more like a living arrangement than anything else. Because of a medical condition we seldom had sex in the last months and realized we get along better as friends than a couple. For sure I still have feelings, why shouldnt I. but I think it could turn out okay.

&amp;#x200B;

But because of all that, its hard to maintain my daily routine. I am not here for sympathy or anything, I just needed to get it off my chest in a space in which I know i will be understood.

Hopefully you all have a good day. I try to remember that there is no goal to fixate on but a string of events in life that I always should make the best off :) Even though it happens to be the way it is now, i try to live a happy life :)"

I’ve been wanting to cut myself for a while but I’m scared of the pain as well as my family finding out or finding me. I don’t see it getting better either, I’ll be like this for the rest of my life and that thought seems so daunting to have to live another 40-50 years with this shit. I literally can’t do it. I’m screaming for someone to help me in my head, but the only words that come out are “haha yea dude I’m fine” and I hate myself so much for it. I just wish I was strong enough to either get help for it or strong enough to just end it all, but either way, I’m not."
depression,2020/02/13,"Is it stupid to stop Lexapro after one day? Hey everybody. I've been struggling with intense OCD mixed with general social anxiety &amp; depression/dread for a while now. I finally started attempting to do something about it this year. At first, I began going to therapy, to try the whole talking thing. I didn't love it. Though to be fair, I didn't give it much of a chance. Only about 4 sessions. From there, I tried some over-the-counter herbal things I found through Google and Amazon. In short, nothing really made a difference.

Cut to yesterday, when I finally bit the bullet and met with a psychiatrist. She put me on 10MG of lexapro for the next 30 days, to see if that fixes me up. From there, I went to pick up my prescription and then proceeded to do roughly 11 hours of straight Googling. Of course, I found plenty of horror stories and ignored all the positive stories. I ended up panickedly writing up a pros/cons list and it just seems like the cons far-outweigh the pros. I'm a film director &amp; writer, constantly dealing with all things creative, and I heard the drug absolutely destroys creativity. Not to mention the weight gain and occasional reports of hair loss. That, mixed with the idea of it turning me into an emotion-less zombie. I mean, I'm a frantic, high-energy person by nature (at least I was before this depression got the better of me) - and it sounds like this drug destroys that too. Plus, apparently the process of quitting Lexapro is absolute hell. So then I'm just gonna have that to think about endlessly?

I don't know, I guess I'm just not meant to be fixed. I took my first Lexapro last night, and I think it's also going to be my last. I don't know what I'm hoping to get out of this post. Does anyone have any thoughts on the matter? Should I be doing something else to fix myself? Should I be sticking with this?  
I just don't know."
depression,2020/02/14,"I can’t stop freaking out about something I *didn’t* do. So I (27M) have a huge crush on a woman (33F) who goes to the same boot camp that I do. I’ve had difficulty with depression since I was 15 and have been having more intense suicidal thoughts in the last few months. This crush has been one of the biggest contributing factors as I’ve always felt very insecure about my lack of success in connecting with people romantically. 

In the past month or so I’ve tried to start casual conversations with her. These brief moments have left me feeling good afterwards, especially on one occasion where she engaged with me by asking what I studied. So I’ve been trying to make a point of asking her how her day went every time I see her. 

So at today’s class she came in a little late and finished the workout on her own. I was planning on asking her how her Valentine’s Day went and complimenting her on her pink heart socks. But I didn’t want to make it look like I was going out of my way to talk to her or approach her while she was stretching after she finished the workout. My plan was to wait by the front desk for her to come up and sign in, but she did a few more stretches than I expected so I stood there waiting a little too long. Since I had already had my coat on I decided it would be too weird to approach her while she was stretching so I just left. 

Now I can’t help but feel stupid for not trying to talk to her. I won’t see her again until the boot camp class on Monday so I’m afraid I’ll be pulling my hair out with stress all weekend. Did I do the right thing by being cautious? Should I just hope that I’ll see her in class on Monday and redeem myself then? I can’t help but feel like an idiot who is going to die alone and miserable because I never take any risks."

Me (20F) been struggling with my own mental health issues since my teenage years some months were good and others just controlled my life. My boyfriend (19M) of three years has depression, and honestly he’s been pushing me away for a weeks blaming it on his mental health and how much he hates himself, and A very very low self esteem. He would leave me on read no matter what I send, whenever I need him would tell me to stop talking, doesn’t respond to me when I text him. Thought it was depression and just kept quiet coz I know how hard fighting a mental illness is. Then on Valentine’s Day someone called me and told me how he had been flirting with that girl (mind you he NEVER told me anything sweet for WEEKS, coz of “depression”) it broke me. He cried, I cried, told me how sorry he was and said “I told you I’m shit and you would be heart broken, coz I’m unavailable” . Had a lot of plans in mind to mask his depression even temporarily and it broke me so badly.

My (26F) brother (23M) attempted yesterday. Thankfully he was not successful. He called to say goodbye and tell me the he loved me. He did the same to some friends and left a note for my parents. This was a very serious attempt. He has had a lot of exceptional stressors lately in addition to the fact that he has been suffering from depression since 2018. He drove a car at 90mph into a telephone pole. Thankfully, he is getting help now and will be getting voluntary inpatient treatment until further necessary. 

I’m going to see him on Monday. What do I say? What do I do?

I don’t want to make it all about me when I see him. I’m angry, scared, and very sad about this. I’m planning to get therapy for myself to cope with the anger, trust issues, and overwhelming sadness that comes with this event.

My friend bens mom was out of town, so we had his house to our selves. We went to another friend's house where a bunch of seniors was. The girl Sarah got drunk off four shots of vodka, and my friends were drinking too. Three of them 18,18 and 19 took Sarah to bens house where they had sex. The next day they called her a bitch, gross and a slut.

They said because of rumors she’s fair game. They ignored her afterward and said, “what did she expect “ and say she’s a slut because not very attractive. She bled because I saw blood on the bens sheet the next day. Ben still hooks up with her sometimes but says it’s only for sex and has no respect for her. They say they did nothing wrong because they were drunk too, and she said yes.

A thought popped up in my head telling me that I could end up being alone forever, and I couldn't cope with it. I started crying uncontrollably, experienced heavy anxiety,  and I felt this massive feeling of self hatred and insignificance. It got so bad that I split myself into three alter egos (with names, and very distinct personalities) that night, and functioned as them for the entirety of the next day. This was a very very odd experience because I'm usually a very composed individual. Even when drunk I usually have a lot of control over my actions but I completley lost it yesterday. I felt as if ""I"" as a person didn't exist, and my ego's would refer to me the progenitor. They'd say things like ""the progenitor was so damaged that he left, and put us in charge."" I know this all sounds so crazy. Now, I'm feeling a bit better, and I'm back to being my whole self but I still feel kind of ""off"".

Well my first post was a rant that made little to no sense. But this morning I just want advice. I need to get my motivation back if I’m going to keep with my dreams and save my marriage.

I know I have to exercise so I’m going to try to do that as well as cutting out junk food and weed. The weed is really tough for me because I find myself wanting to make excuses to try to keep it in my life. I threw out most of my weed stuff and now only have a single battery for cartridges but may need to toss that one too. 

For the most part I function okay but I’ve lost my passion and I need it back. I especially need help with being motivated to read. For school I usually have to read about 300 pages a week of various books and articles and that just for class not my own research. I find I get fatigued a couple lines in and almost always push it to the last minute so I’m skimming material way more than I should be. 

Anyways any advice on how to keep on keeping on would be great. Maybe someone who can help keep me on track?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi. I'm not used to write anything on social media, much less things related to depression, so I'm not sure if this will fit here as it may be a long post with some background. To clear things up from the begginning: this is my main account, I'm Spanish (mentioning this because as things here in Europe-particularly  economically wise- are different, they may have been a contributing factor to my depression. Maybe, even if there are similarities, mine could be very similar and yet very different than yours if you live in the USA or any other country) aaaand this is me:

I wanted to share this to address something you all already know. Guess what, yep that's my instagram profile photo. Notice the smile. Everything in that photo is staged, I hadn't slept at all for two days, did not want to smile, and I took nearly 8 photos until I got one which made me look less shitty. I've already had several people telling me that my eyes scream sadness. Other than that, I've recently started noticing the area directly under the eyelids to be darker and darker.

Anyway. I don't want this post to be read like a teen-vampire-romance book so I'll try to be pragmatic. My problem started when I was 15 following my first breakup (summer between my third and fourth HS year). You'd think that I'd be stuck thinking about my ex gf for more than a decade but no, as even though I really loved her that issue would eventually stop hurting.

However, I don't know if by that age I was already starting to develop depression as I was in HS, which means I got to be around friends, maybe look for other girls (which I eventually did), etc. Still, I remember that by my fourth year of HS I had started to skip classes. By the end of said fourth year I had a total sum of a full month of absences. 6 hours a day, 150 hours worth of learning, lost. It wasn't like I was skipping classes to go party. I just slept or waited for hours alone, sitting down, thinking.

To clarify: my parents are not the problem, they're along with our dog the best thing that could ever happen to me, so it was even worse when I started coming home with worse, and worse grades. I went from being one of the three best students in our class to the guy who girls ask ""hey, didn't you like, drop from school?"".

My friend list was getting emptier and emptier by the months, but I somehow managed to get to college. Spoiler: It ended up badly. People were not a problem... but me doing nothing for the whole year, or sitting in class for 1 hour and then leaving to go hide at home when thoughts started coming to mind and couldn't manage the anxiety and sadness, definitely were.

I couldn't take it anymore, so I talked to my dad and told him that I wanted to go back home and work. Get my own money, and pay for my shit. This was back when I was 22 if I'm not mistaken, I was mad at myself for wasting my parents' money and after several tries I managed to convince them.

And here is when things get fun!!1! I mentioned Europe economy situation and here is when it comes into play. Nobody wants to hire me, nobody needs anyone new. I have my city and 15 minutes -walking- from me I have Gibraltar. Welppp. Nothing. Not stores, not bars, not pubs, not fucking Mcdonald's. Nobody hires me.

And here I am now. 26 years old, still living with my parents, with no way of making money, no friends, same clothes I bought when I was 16. Needless to say my self-steem is nonexistent, and even though I'm dumb I can still undertsand that my vibes, especially without caring for myself, are not what employers are after. I mean, I shower, still use deodorant and sometimes I fix my beard a little, but I've forgotten about my body almost completely.

I don't have any possitive emotions, I do not want to do anything, always bitter, resentful, envious. I can't suicide because I don't want to ruin my mother, so I can only hope to encounter a psycho on the street (that's one of the reasons for night walks) or get a terminal disease. It's fucking sad because I used to laugh a lot, I had dreams, heck, I could even talk to some girls like ""heeeey u missed me babe? I know, I know... ;)"". My inexperienced 16 year old could do more shit than me in half the time.

I can't even make friends. I looked through friends-based subreddits and what I see are people describing the best traits of them, hoping to connect to other human being. What am I going to say? ""Hi, I'm Snow and I'm a whinny, emotional-bomb uncaring person whose only thoughts are complaints. Worse than a Karen's complaints, in fact"". I know people don't want to get to know someone just to hear their problems, and even if I somehow managed to talk to someone, then part 2 kicks in and we enter in no-trust-and-much-fear territory. 

That's one of the worst parts. I can't even talk to someone for an extended period of time without eventually dissapearing. Once I found a website for penpals. I got to know a girl who was very shy at first, and during that perior I would log in every day. Then she started speaking more and I started waiting days between answers. The result? She finally left me on read. Can't blame her, and I didn't even want to flirt, I just wanted a friend. I try not to be a jerk so I like to answer everyone, but once things start to get more intimate, be it in a friendly or flirty way, I bail out.

In the end and to sum up, I can't barely get out of bed, I always try to be kind when speaking to someone but nothing I do encourages me to keep going, as I try to hide this damn illness from everyone. I just let days fly by now...

What a dissertation lol I'm sorry. I never talk about my own things, I guess  I had to vent a little. Thanks for reading :D Please excuse any mistakes, I've tried to write properly but I'm honestly too tired to do another check"
depression,2020/02/18,"It's getting worse My \[28M\]'s girlfriend \[26F\] has always had depression. She's always been sad, low energy, lonely, hopeless. And I've always been here, loving her anyway.

Recently, however, it's escalated. Her anxiety has become severe. Her habit of picking scabs and pulling out hair has accelerated to the point of no return. Her bald spot and severe open sores would make it hard for anyone to want to leave the house, much less a depressed person. 

She cannot/does not function at all. She will sleep for up to 72 hours straight, she talks about how she hates herself and doesn't want to live. When she does manage to get out of bed, the most minor inconveniences induce a panic attack and/or crying fit. The most recent example.. running out of dishwasher fluid.

I've been supportive for so long, and I will continue to be. But what happens next? over the past 7 years, it's been new meds, new doctors, inpatient, repeat. How does this ever end? She's only gotten worse, with her school and career to a place of no return. I can't see her ever climbing out of this hole. And as her boyfriend, what do I do? I can't force her to feel better, I can only offer my support. But I've been doing that for years and it's only gotten worse. What can I do? How can I make this end?

&amp;#x200B;

She's DONE the therapy, she's DONE the doctors, she's taken the meds. She's TRIED..for years. Nothing has helped... thanks for reading anyway."
depression,2020/02/19,"Why am I so insecure about guys? (Serious) Recently I(20M) went to a mental rehabilitation centre and it really did me well.....or half of me anyway. 

My psychiatrist is great and i see her every month. Shes helped me realise a lot of the reasons why I'm sad all the time....but we never really focused on my anxiety and I kinda have a lot on her shoulders already, so i dont want to work on my anxiety rn when my happiness is more important. But anyway...

I'm hella afraid of guys around (talking to, assciated with, looking at, etc) my GF(21F). I'm so afraid of not being good enough or her finding someone she connects with better or someone better looking or makes her happier or steal her heart in any way. 

""Trust her""....I know, but I'm still scared amd I cant help it. 

Why am I like this and how can I combat it?"
depression,2020/02/20,"Not wanting help / not wanting to get better First of all i want to say that i have not been diagnosed with depression but from what is happening there is no way im not suffering from it. The reason why i havent been diagnosed is because i didnt go see the psychiatrist. I have had an intense fear of going for a while now because of a previous experience. A few years back i have been diagnosed with asperger's after spending around 3 weeks at a ward (it was a terrible experience). Ive been put on strong medication that has only made me miserable and unable to function at all. I know that i should just tell the psych that but it was pretty traumatic and ive been in fear of going since.

With that out of the way, ive been having serious issues lately, i stopped enjoying everything i liked before, i cant get myself to do anything but stay in bed all day. This has been going for a few months although im not really sure about that because i honestly cant remember a time when i felt too different then now. Today i realized  i might be addicted to depression, ive caught myself  many times refusing help and putting myself down for the sake of feeling the same.

I feel like im rambling and i dont wanna make this post too long, not sure if i said everything but i wanted to ask if any of you had this experience before, and if so, what helped? I feel like i know the answer (psychologist) but its extremely hard to do it. 

Anyway thank you for reading, this post was also a way to vent and put my feelings out there. Sorry for any grammar mistakes or nonsensical sentences (english is my second lang.) although my english is alright im not thinking clear right now.

Ps. Im 18M if that is relevant at all."

NO HOT WOMEN LIKE ME

I'm miserable about how attractive women don't want me and I'm miserable that I'm broke and poor living with my father. I'm 26 never a girlfriend or kissed still a virgin. I'm fat ugly short and poor. I'm frustrated and miserable and stressed. Nobody loves me.
My best friend is about to become a pharmacist and his girlfriend is unreal hot and my other close friend has just gotten in with a very big firm and it's going to make a hundred grand a year and his girlfriend is ridiculous hot and I'm 26 and I'm just now halfway towards my bachelor's and I'm on academic probation so it feels like I've ruined my life already cuz I'm so far behind compared to everybody else.Hot girls don't date fat dudes who live with their dad. I also work for my dad as a salesman because I don't want to push carts at a grocery store. And attractive women don't date cart pushers. 

Where I grew up in Colorado all the girls thought I was a loser and when I hung out with my friends my friends girlfriends think I'm a loser and it is because I'm ugly looking and fat.
 I now live in Massachusetts and I'm practically invisible to good looking women and I also don't have any friends here and I've lived here for 7 years I only have friends because I keep tabs and visit my once in Colorado.

26M Never a girlfriend or kissed still a virgin never a date I'm fat ugly short and poor. No decent women (20sF) like me. Nobody cares that I am miserable and no one wants to help me and no one cares about me. Can I get advice?

depression,2020/02/21,"30M I've been working at starbucks for five years and it has made me develop my first panic attacks and serious depression. I'm scared, because I want to quit but I'm so wrecked from this job that I don't think I could handle any job. I don't know what to do and feel really scared even though I'm an ""adult"" 30 years old now.

People will say, oh just go learn a trade or oh just go apply at this retail store or that restaurant.

I have no energy or focus to learn anything anymore like I used to. I can barely even hold a conversation without getting tired. 

I eat healthy and I stick to running and going to the gym. I'm in great physical shape but the stress of work destroys me instantly. 

These jobs are destroying so many young people and it isn't being talked about enough I think. 

I even debated quitting and being homeless instead. 

Starbucks corporation is slashing hours at all stores so they can eek out more profit. This has been happening since the holidays. It has been absolute hell! Huge lines of people standing and staring at you, while you alone make drinks and then have to go and restock yourself in order to continue because there is no one else to help you. Then the managers yell at us for poor customer surveys. They blame it all on us and keep themselves out of it. It is such hell on a daily basis.

I don't know what to do. Quitting would be a huge fucking relief I'm sure but then I'll have to be homeless I guess. I don't want to work for anyone anymore.

All I want is to be completely alone. If I could just have food and a place to be completely alone to read  books or hike forest trails, I would be in heaven."
depression,2020/02/21,"I (24M)am severely depressed I broke up with my (23F) of 9.5 years and I realized I'm interested in men instead of women  

About  4 months ago I (24m) had broken off a 9 and a half year  relationship  with someone (23f) I thought I was going to spend my life  with I love  her and she was my best friend and I do still love and care  about her.  The beginning of the breakup things were really bad she hated  my guts  and things were not going well, I moved out and got my own  apartment of  course. Reasons I had broken this off is because things had  gotten  extremely toxic with fighting all the time some times physical  as well.  Something I had come to realize is I am attracted to men..  which is  probably why I was no longer interested in the sexual aspect of  things.  4 months later her and I are doing well, we text or snapchat  eachother  and I go over to her house once in a while to visit the dog  and cat  that we had gotten together in the past. She has told me about  guys  that she has been talking to or trying to talk to and also told me   about a potential date she has coming up possibly. We are now pretty   good friends and have agreed that we were not good together. About 3   days ago I had started talking to a guy I met on tinder and plan to meet   him this weekend in person. My problem is I still care and love for  her  even if I am not attracted to women sexually, I feel so guilty  pursuing  this whatever it may be with this guy I just started talking  to, I do  enjoy talking to him but part of me is considering ""ghosting""  him  because of the guilt I feel, because I'm the one that ended the   relationship so I feel guilt thinking I don't deserve to be happy since I   had made her sad when I ended the relationship. This guilt is causing   me to have anxiety attacks it sucks. Thank you to anyone who can give   some advice. 

(UPDATE) she said she doesn't want to be friends she either wants us to be together or nothing and if I choose nothing I can no longer visit the dog and cat that were ours that live with her. I am too afraid to come out to anyone even friends and especially to her as I have a huge fear of being judged which I know for a fact my friends will end up either stop talking to me completely or judge me a lot and I know for a fact that she will not take it well at all.

TL;DR I broke off a 9  and a half year relationship because things were toxic and I realized  I'm attracted to men, I feel guilty about my ex"
depression,2020/02/22,"Feeling really lonely after a breakup TL:DR After a very shakey few months, we finally broke up and it's tearing me apart. 

Before we were together, he (18M) was my (17F) best friend. We would talk all the time and hang out like friends do. Our relationship was very fulfilling, at least for me. I had never felt so connected to someone, and I don't mean romantically. I was able to understand his likes, his reasoning, his personality etc in a way that felt natural. That never happened to me before. Not even with my family or any past friends. 

Not only are we not together, but he doesn't even want to talk to me (long story) and I feel so empty. We would find time to tell each other about our days and he really was such an important part of my life. I know I was a handful. I have so many panic attacks and rapid mood swings, but he never made me feel like I was a burden to him. I never thought that I would be able to make anyone happy in the way that I was apparently making him.

I feel so mad at myself. I think back at the times when I would be upset because I wouldn't see him as much as I would have liked or that he fell asleep before we could say goodnight. I would give anything to have that again. I just want to go back in time and relive every moment so that I can fully appreciate what I had. 

I feel so stupid for letting myself fall into it so deep. He was my first everything; from the first person to show genuine interest in being in my life to more physical milestones. Now it's all gone. My light in so much darkness. We're teenagers? What did I expect? Yet somehow I still feel into the trap. 

I thought we were more than just some teenage fling. I thought I actually had some greater value in his life than to just pass the time. Now I'm finding myself grieving a relationship that feels like was all in my head. 

I can't stop crying. I just want all this to go away."
depression,2020/02/22,"I just can’t do this anymore I’ve reached my limit. I [28M] can’t do this anymore. By this, I mean, working to the bone for less talented people for a meager hamster wheel existence of being broke. I have trouble with authority. I see through everyone’s bullshit and just can’t play nice when the existential dread sets in. What’s the point of living while just barely paying rent and just barely having enough food with nothing to look forward to and no way to tap my potential as an entrepreneur. Job or no job, I never get ahead. This sucks big time."
depression,2020/02/22,"Has anyone been fell in love again with your ex after you’re no longer depressed? About 4 years ago, I (20F) used to be depressed and I fell out of love with my bf. I broke up with him. But after I was no longer depressed, I’ve just realized the fact that I still love him but yeah it's too late.

Time goes by, I met my recent bf (21M) and we started to date. He was diagnosed with depression before I met him. We got along well with each other. Everything seems perfect but suddenly his depression became severe. He felt exactly the same way I used to feel. I’ve tried to tell him this feeling is not permanent but failed. He always feels down when he can't force himself to be happy around me. And always thought he can only bringing trouble and sadness to me. He also said he doesn't feel like he loves me as much as before and can't take care of anyone else's feeling now. So we decided to break up to save our own mental health.

All the feelings depression did to him was used to happen with me. But I’m wondering if it was only me who started to fall in love again with the same person after I’m no longer depressed or not? Do I still have a chance to get back with him since we didn’t have got any big problems in our relationship (except the fact he is now depressed) before?

depression,2020/02/22,"Any change in treatment in the last 10 years? Some background: 33M tried Paxil in my early 20s for anxiety and depression. Despite the medication, I still felt the need self medicate with recreational drugs (mainly weed, booze, anabolic steroids, and the occasional Percocet). The combination led me to have a year long period where I would occasionally get dizzy, get sudden cold sweats, and then black out and collapse like a sack of potatoes. This was not pleasant. It freaked my friends out. I became a burden to my girlfriend. I finally nutted up and said I wanted to switch to something else. Enter Lexapro. Lexapro made me total zombie with a constant droning thought of “you should probably just drive into oncoming traffic now”. So I stopped the Lexapro too. Fast forward, it’s been ten years since I’ve taken meds, and I’ve recently realized I need would like to address my depression again.


So my question is: Have depression meds changed at all in ten years? Or is my doctor just going to throw me back on an ssri?"

depression,2020/02/24,"No Reason to be depressed (18M if that matters) Not a fan of word vomit, so i'll try to keep this concise.  

I live in an upper middle class family ( only child if that matters) and I was the typical introverted ""smart kid"" throughout elementary school. Hard work wasn't needed to achieve stellar grades. Middle school fucked me over tho; it was a new school with new people and I was far out of my element. Compounded with my lack of work ethic, this took a toll on every aspect of my life. I've felt useless ever since. But, all will be detailed in the following. 

In preschool ( age 4) I didn't have control over my anger, so when someone annoyed me, I would hit them. The teachers, obviously, didn't like that and told me not to hit. Needless to say, kids my age didn't really like me either and I became anti-social, eventually entering elementary school with sub-optimal social skills. Although my violent tendencies slowed in elementary, they didn't stop, and, more importantly, neither did the incessant guilt that followed. Keep that last part in mind. 

At age 5 I started Taekwondo. I only did this because my one of my few friends did it as well. Like most martial arts, there is fighting element called sparring. I HATED it. I was conditioned to NOT hit, which is not ideal if you are trying to fight someone. So, when they hit me, I didn't know how to handle it and I cried. I was not only self conscious of my violent tendencies that I repressed them at all costs, but I was also humiliated in front of everyone whenever there was a sparring class. 

I think you get the message. I wasn't very social, wasn't good at anything useful and I felt like shit because of it. Now back to the present. 

 Just, barely, graduated high school and I have no direction in life; grades were shit so I'm not going to Uni and I have no energy to look for a new hobby or passion. I'm TRYING to fix my diet and workout but its extremely difficult. Nothing matters anymore, I think about suicide everyday. I even tried it once. 

If, for whatever reason, you want to know more, I'll happily oblige.

depression,2020/02/24,"How do I get help? I (14M) suspect that I have depression. I feel tired and sad all of the time, and doing small things exhaust me, which has caused me to fall far behind on my schoolwork. I have also had most of the causes for depression happen to me, such as death to a loved one (my dad), abandonment (my mom), and sexual and physical abuse (my aunt). I now live with my grandparents who are very strong believers that all (or most) mental illnesses are just people wanting attention. How do I get help without being judged or ridiculed by them?"
depression,2020/02/24,"I (29M) feel empty and lonely even though I have friends and gf I've been in RL for about 2 years.

I could say i'm outgoing, every weekend I would go out to a party, know a lot of people talk to them occasionally 

I have my regular spot where I hang out and know everyone from the owner to bartenders and frequent guests. Every once in a two weeks or so I would catch up with my best friend we would hang out and talk about deep topics.

I would say I have good relationship with my (goth big tittdy) gf, we see each other every second day or so, our sex life is awesome we really enjoy spending time together.

But I feel unaccomplished and stuck, the main reason is that I got this corpo job 9-5 which pays alright and can be dull without big intensity but it gives me to be independent and in the same time it ties me down where I don't have mental power to start something on my own or even go to the gym. I see it as ""i don't have time for it"" even tough i have plenty time 9-5 job and 25min commute should give me a lot of time to explore new things, right? I've tried for 3 months or so to hit the gym with my gf but when I became overwhelmed with job and she had to travel I dropped out. Thinking to get back again.

Occasionally I would have this clingy moment where I really question is everything normal, I would be mad or more precisely said disappointed that I don't interact with my gf or share some stupid memes. feel isolated and alone without anyone around me.

I try to think of a way to burn this feeling with fire or to find something that fulfills me and motivates me.

I would like to find more mental energy for ideas that i have, i get motivated with some ideas like build some gadgets where i ordered half of parts already, try to continue with my online store which has some orders but i just lose the will.

I'm currently living day by day without plans for the future and that causes overwhelming anxiety in me since i think im average loser without anything accomplished in my life.

Is this some kind of depression or apathy? Deep down i'm struggling with this emptiness even tough if you look from the outside you would say i got my shit together and everything is fine. How to find some supporting community and snap out of it?

I see how it is ruining my life and relationship because i can't keep my frame as a stable, well round male that can maintain good relationships (i would be passive aggressive if i feel that im ignored) with girlfriend, friends (i would close down and talk and see them less), job (i don't perform well and see hopelessness) etc...

I guess even this will get downvoted as perceived i got my shit together and i'm just whining"

depression,2020/02/25,"Long depressed post I know you guys must be tired hearing these types of rant over and over again. But if you can please read the whole.
I am 32M, currently doing PhD. I will be out of fellowship next month and it's still a year before I finish my PhD. I have been suicidal in my school days, tried once but no one knows.
I have these thoughts again and again when I see my future going no where. I have a huge stage phobia of addressing any gathering or even having anyone's attention on me. This thing is hurting me most as in my PhD and in future I have to address audience (students) as I want to be a professor and I really enjoy explaining things to other but only one on one or to a small familiar non judgemental audience. Everytime before my half early PhD presentation I get in to a depressed stage and I feel like I run somewhere and be in isolation. 
Before my first PhD presentation I was under huge mental stress and it got me diabetes insipidus (I think it was due to stress). I do not like sharing these thoughts with anyone and it's the first time I am sharing it to anyone. I think sharing this will not help me and people will just pretend they care but no one actually cares. I think I don't have the capability to survive financially or emotionally. I like being alone, living alone.
On personal front I have a girlfriend and our marriage is fixed later in this year. We have been together since 10+ years but I feel I am ruining her life too. She is very confident, well spoken in front of anyone but she is stuck with me.
The reason why I don't share these thoughts is because I have done nothing to solve these issue. I am a lazy person and just want to lay in bed surfing net playing games. I know I can be better but I don't make any effort. Also I am not brave enough for a suicide and I just wish someday I vanish from this world or better vanish from everyone's life like I never existed."
depression,2020/02/25,"Any advice. Any. Fuck making a throwaway, I'll just write my thoughts and see what happens.

20M, mandatory community service. I'm doing it at a library, I believe it was the only place left in my hometown right now to do it. So in a lot of ways I could say I'm lucky. Didn't have to move anywhere, didn't have to even change my gym membership or anything.

But the library is destroying my fucking head. It's me either doing overly easy tasks that have gotten pretty goddamn boring after 2 months of being there, or it's me having nothing to do because it often feels like they don't really even need me. But I still can't fill this time with something else like being on my phone or reading books or whatever because the staff still wants me to do something... even if there's nothing to do. You know the kind of people that just make no goddamn sense. Like how dare you just wait for more work!!! Do that thing again then even if there's no need to!!

I tried talking about this immediately with family etc, but they're just ignoring it. First they gave a pretty good point saying that it takes a couple weeks to a month for something to become a routine so just keep going. But now it's been 2 months of just endless slow, boring, mind-numbingly fucking frustrating days and I'm so tired of it. And of course now when I try talking about it, it's just ignored. It's that instant ""stop complaining"" thing. I read how it's about attitude often, and doing it just to be able to enjoy other things. But this library is in my FUCKING WAY constantly. Can't relax and enjoy movies, music, shows or games because the library's in my head constantly. If the two months had gone fast, 9 more wouldn't sound so bad. But they've been SO SLOW. Sooooooo slow. 9 more sounds awful.

Hitting a wall or screaming doesn't help. The only thing so far relieving some of the anger is hitting myself in the head and slapping myself hard. That's the only thing that lets some pressure and frustration out. Hitting objects doesn't help because it's me trying to find an alternative to real pain and violence, and those things are in my mind A LOT at the moment.

Over a year ago a childhood friend of mine killed himself because of bad depression and ignorant people around him just ignoring his dreams and not being supportive in any way or helping with his mental health. He was always a super ambitious and smart person. I'm not suicidal at the moment, but the more people just fucking ignore my terrible feelings and the more I'm forced to go to this place every day, the more I'm starting to like the idea of doing something bad. I don't know what's gonna happen if I hear ""you just gotta do it"" one more time.

I don't even know what I'm trying to accomplish with this post. Any sort of advice probably. Bro 9 more months of this. NINE."
depression,2020/02/25,"How to get help without parents knowing/approving? For any region specific laws/regulations - I live in the tri state area.

Not really looking to rant just need some advice. I'm 20M, in college being funded by my parents and on their insurance. Been thinking for a while now I need at least therapy if not meds for this shit of a life but my parents are a) not really approachable with this kind of stuff and b)don't really understand mental illness as a concept they think it's just lazy and a lack of effort (it took literally 12 years to convince them I had ADD).

Do I have any options to get sessions without them knowing/approving? I can't afford to pay myself."
depression,2020/02/25,"I sorta beat social anxiety and now it created a bigger problem I (16M) suffer from mild social anxiety but it used to be worse, so as a coping mechanism to not knowing how to socialize I make jokes, and a lot of jokes roasting myself in sometimes extreme manners, as I always do things. It made me less of a ""loser/loner"" and more of a ""regular kid"" which is awesome for a teenager, BUT.

As I said I make a lotta jokes about myself, and people think that they can too, seems logical, yet it isn't, I can't take it, people make fun of everything I do. Even when I find the courage to tell them I'm not ok, which is hard considering I got SA, they somehow making fun of it later on.

One time one girl I really thought was one of my best friends, along with a tiny bit of help from her friends, single handedly managed to make try to jumper under a speeding car (I didn't get hurt). It didn't seem like me, I never thought I would try to kill myself, even in my darkest times. 

Shit got worse when her two friends were trash-talking me directly in front of me, while I was in midst of a mental breakdown that nobody was even remotely trying to stop. They said that they were dissappointed about my ""asshole behavior"", which was literally a fucking mental breakdown FFS.

There hasn't been much lately, and things seem like they're going a bit more smoothly, but I've missing these long writing sessions on reddit's finest rant subs. And I still feel very bad and lonely, so I thought I'd share with other people who are in kinda the same boat."
depression,2020/02/26,"I (22F) am in a downward spiral and it never stops This is my first ever post on reddit so I’m sorry if it violates any rules or anything! This is super long so there will be TLDR at the end...

The world is ending and that is the only way to describe how I feel. The world is ending and I’m suffocating but it’s not to anybody else. 

Background: I’ve had depression/anxiety for as long as I can remember. I have a wildly complicated/horrible relationship with my mother (a single mother who raised me, an only child, by herself) and a friendly relationship with my father who wasn’t around much until I was like 10 so it’s like not at all a parental kind of relationship. 

I’m in my last semester of college and it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I’m overloaded with 21 hours of classes and working 8 hours 2 days a week. 

I don’t have any friends. I used to but as I get older the depression gets worse. My self esteem is wrecked. I have incredible social anxiety that’s also gotten worse as I get older. The actual only human contact I have is my wonderful boyfriend (21M) who lives with me. He is patient and supportive in every way possible and showed me what love truly is. His family are amazing people and I love them too. They are everything I wanted in my family as a kid. 

I regularly see a therapist and a psychologist and am on medication. Two things have triggered my downward spiral: the loss of a written prescription of my antidepressants which has caused me to be off them for about a month (but I have since found and been back on them but only for about 5 days and this is also 100% my fault and I’m kicking myself for this) and the severing of my relationship with my mother. She had me young (21) and we have had a super insane relationship with no boundaries at all whatsoever. She is my absolute best friend in the whole world but also the cause of my depression and anxiety, regularly verbally and emotionally manipulating and abusing me since I hit puberty. 

BECAUSE OF ALL OF THIS I am incredibly depressed and anxious and it’s getting worse with each passing day. Something new happens with my mother almost every day where she has been cold to me. But on top of this, I have been physically sick with the flu (which is going around in my area) &amp; it has caused me to miss my class last week. It is 3 days a week for 4 hours. But I am able to work at home because we use our laptops to run the program we work on, so I have been keeping up with schoolwork. 

Last Friday was our midway presentation on our final projects (I graduate this May) and I ended up having a full on panic attack because I didn’t have enough money to print my presentation out on my university account and I left my wallet at home because my boyfriend drove me to school. It was already past time the class had started so I ran outside to try to calm down but everything had built up and I couldn’t stop crying. Needless to say I didn’t go to class. I emailed my professor an embarrassingly cringey email about what happened and he hasn’t responded. (Attendance is important in this class)

This past weekend was Mardi Gras which I did NOT participate in because it turns out I have a sinus infection right after getting the flu. I have a dr note for this. 

I relapsed on my antibiotics and had to go back today to get a stronger prescription. Mardi Gras classes resumed today at 12:30. My class starts at 1:30. I got a drs note because I obviously still feel bad (coughing up mucus, sneezing constantly, blowing my gross snotty nose every 5 seconds, deep mucusy cough every 10 seconds. It’s NOT pretty) and the class is freaking 4 hours long and I don’t want to subject anyone else to that either??? The classroom is tiny. 

So I sent him it. I said I can present when I come back this Friday. He has yet to respond to that too. 
I’m terrified I’m going to fail and not graduate. I have to graduate because I have an amazing job lined up for me afterwards.

TLDR: it feels like bad thing after bad thing keeps happening to me and I really want to just give up but i have so much pressure to not give up that it makes me so fucking anxious!!!

My anxiety is CRIPPLING me right now. I don’t really know why I posted this and I’m not really expecting any responses. But if you had any kind words to say that would be really appreciated..."

I Didn't attend most of high school, missed most of Year 9 - 11, and i feel so FUCKING GUILTY for not going, i want to retry it all, but i'm to embarrassed, doing the grades again.  
I Was diagnosed with depression in late 2017 (When i was in Year 9) Now in Tafe, Alone, with no friends to help me along  
I Really want to succeed but i just...just have no motivation, i feel nothing but...Hollow?"
depression,2020/02/27,"The moment you realize the first signs of relapse 21M. I had a major depressive episode about 3 years ago, around the time I was graduating high school. Towards the end of last year I think I started declining again, but I refused to acknowledge it. It was just a “rough patch.” But now I’m too tired to do anything, my grades are declining, and I don’t care about anything. I’m living in the past, thinking of the times when I was really happy, confident, and proud of myself. I miss those times. Compared to then, I feel worthless and like I haven’t made any progress with my life. I don’t want to slip fully back into the depression I had then because it put a lot of strain on my relationships. Including my girlfriend (who I am still with and also struggles with depression) and my dad.

I’m trying to work through it and prevent it from becoming worse. I know I tie a lot of my self worth to the accomplishments I make but I feel like I haven’t made any in the past 2 years. I’m considering transferring from my University to an online university to finish my degree so I can work full time and make progress toward my goal of being independent. I think that might make me feel better. My girlfriend wants me to see a therapist/psychiatrist but I don’t want to worry my dad and burden him with the cost of covering any bills as I’m still on his insurance and everything. I just feel like I need to change something.

Thanks for reading."
depression,2020/02/27,"I've been sitting idle at my computer with no music on for over two hours and I just realized that I more depressed than I like to admit. I'm thinking what to write, because I no longer know what I should be feeling, I'm alone.

Sometimes it feels as if I'm walking into a snowy forest, as the frosting breeze touches my face just to keep me alive and sane. 

People used to call me interesting, but they never put in the effort to get to know me. 

People used to chat with me, they no longer do. 

People used to see me smile, now they are not even around to see me cry. 

I'm a mess, with no friends, my family doesn't support me and make me look like shit. 

To be quite frank, I am tired. 

I, 1MilVoltage, curse each day I woke up and will wake up in the future. 

I pray to God, with all my heart that he finds it in his heart to put me out of my misery, I pray that one day I will go to sleep and it will be the last time I will think about this endless ugly cycle that we call ""life"". 

Please God, if you exist, prove that you exist and take me with you, I no longer wish to stay here."
depression,2020/02/27,"Im too young to want to die, I don't want to but I feel as though going on living would be pointless I (20M) am trying really hard not to feel this way but I just can stop thinking about being depressed, reasons being the relationship I have with myself, my friends and family and my future, please, to anyone who have ever struggled with depression, please share me some knowledge as to how I can make things better. 

I have no plans of killing myself, I assure everyone, I just dont know what to do with my life anymore from this point on."
depression,2020/02/27,"There is hope but it usually means a lot of work. 38M here with depression or rather depressive states coming and going on regular basis. I feel like there is a lot of people like me here and I just want you to know that there is hope to get out of this. The problem is that there is work that has to be done. 
There is so many ways to help coping with this darkness. Meditation, being active (sometimes to to the point where it becomes an obsession), breathwork, psychedelics, therapy and many others. 
Sometimes, I come here to read your posts and my heart breaks how many people are suffering and don't have proper coping mechanisms. Life isn't easy, I would say it's very hard for most people but also most people are not willing to put work into making their lives better. 
Become obsessed with something, learn new thing, get out of your comfort zone and for gods sake change the pattern! 
Some people will say that depression is preventing them from doing all those things and I agree to a certain point but give it a shot. Maybe it's not as bad as we think. Maybe it's just an illusion! 
My heart is breaking seeing so many people depressed and I wish you all that you find the courage and strength to live your life fully. We have only so much time here. 
Lots of love to all of you!"
depression,2020/02/27,"Confused and looking for advice So lately, last 6 months or so, I (33M) have been pretty depressed.....I think. I don’t know if it is actually depression or not or just a time in my life where I am down. You see, the thing is, I’m not always down in the dumps. I think I am actually a pretty happy normal guy most of the time but every day there are hours where I hate my life and think about suicide...even though I know I’ll never do it. I don’t really know what I should do. Should I tell my wife? If I do, I think that there is a chance she doesn’t feel comfortable with me being around our 2 year old. If I do tell someone, is this something that is medication worthy? If it is medication worthy, is there a natural “medication” I can take instead? Is this actual depression or just a down time in my life? I guess part of me is worried, hence why I am writing this, and another part of me just wants to get this off my chest. So with that, I thank you all for reading and I appreciate all the advice and thoughts."
depression,2020/02/27,"Don't know what to do anymore I (20M) have been dealing with major depression since I was in 10th grade. It was kinda bad then, but I got better for a time. My first semester at college was rough, but I got through it and was fine again. I'm now in my second semester of sophomore year and my depression worse than it ever has been before. I come in and out of depressed states, but my roommates have been finding me staring off, unresponsive. While in those states, I can hear them yelling my name, and I don't know if it is that I don't care to answer or I physically can't. These last few days, all I can do is sleep and stare at my arm, imagining taking my razor to it. I know it's wrong and I don't think I want to do it, I don't want to do it to my family, but the only place I can imagine myself in the future is either dead or being so depressed I can't function. I've been seeing therapist, but it isn't helping, my meds no longer help and it is a struggle to keep taking them...
I don't know what I should do, my grades are horrible because of this, which doesn't help.
I really don't want to go to the hospital, but I also don't want to fully loose the little keeping me from offing myself.

 I just want my mind to be quite. All I want is peace and normal thinking."
depression,2020/02/27,"Not even sad anymore, just feel nothing always I've (24M) come to an odd place in my depression that kinda has made it worse for me. Throughout my life I've aways been somewhat hyper aware of my own emotional state, as my emotions have always been something which I've felt incredibly intensely. 

When I was younger 17-19 I was very lonely and had a hard time connecting with others, this grew into something I came to recognized as situation depression. I had always believed I would feel truly better if I made those important social connections in my life. Eventually I did, I found myself in a strong circle of friends, working towards my life goals, and in love for the first time in my life with an amazing girl. This truly made me content, my depression went away and for the first time in my adult life I knew what it was like to be happy and proud of myself. this lasted about 2-3 years (19-22) and made me believe that it was possible to live a happy life. 

Slowly and one by one I began to lose the things that were important to me. My family moved across the country while I was in school and our relationships soured, my girlfriend moved away, we tried long distance but it wasn't what she wanted, she ghosting me and started a new life, my best friends slowly started to move away, change for the worse (lots of drugs and alcohol involved) or leave, one of my best friends passed away, and I started to fail out of school. All of this put me into the darkest hole ive ever been in and to be honest im not sure if I've ever fully recovered. 

(22-23) I can remember the most intense and excruciating sadness of my life, physically it felt like this vast aching hollowness inside of my chest and stomach that would never ever go away. Like the deepest blackest pit I could imagine had replaced the spot where my heart used to be ... 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next two years (23-24) things began to turn around and my life improved. I turned my grades around after about 4 horrible wasted semesters, I started a new relationship, met some new people who became my friends, and I started working again after a long break. But truthfully I never felt content the way I used to and I'm still not the same. 

I dont truly connect with friends anymore and feel distant to everyone around me. I've now graduated from school finally with my BA after 6 years and moved back to my hometown, I dont keep in touch with my newer friends and only really talk to my girlfriend who ive been with for 2 years now (we're doing long distance now and its hard). Sometimes I honestly dont feel the capacity to love someone anymore and it puts an incredibly heavy strain on my relationship with her, I feel she deserves better than that and she always have. But the truth is I dont feel anything anymore, its just blank numbness every single day and night of my life. Im trying to get past it, im trying to better and love what I still have and what Ive made for myself but I still feel so utterly empty and void of emotion, its almost like thats the best emotionally I can do for myself and ive just come to except it.

Im about to turn 25 now, Im looking for full time jobs, staying active with exercise, I am sober since the new year and trying my best in my relationship but still feel profoundly empty.

I dont know what the point of this post really is but I needed to share my story. I really appreciate it if you read this far and would be happy to read any response or advice anyone in this community has. Thank you."
depression,2020/02/28,"I often find myself weeping throughout my day when the loneliness gets bad It was never this bad, but the more time that this goes on the worse it gets.

I can't talk to people, and when I do end up finding the courage to do so, I panic and forget what I was going to say, or I just end up sounding like a weirdo.

Hi guys, I’m sorry to be so short. I (22M) have been living my life alone, forever, until I fell in love. My relationship lasted a long while, few years, until today my girlfriend left me. Aside from her and her family, I don’t talk to a single person. I live with her, we share our entire lives, and she left me.

I now feel alone, and to be honest I just want to die. I have felt this way before, even attempted, but I’ve never been successful. Now I feel I’m at the point where I have to do it. I don’t want to live another day that nobody cares about me, it hurt too bad before and it hurts now. 

I just felt like I had to let someone know, tell someone how I am feeling, because I don’t have anyone to listen. I can live, especially not like this.

depression,2020/02/28,"My (19M) Gf (18M) is suffering from severe depression and pushes me away more and more every day A little Backstory: I grew up in a children's home since I'm 7 because I have no Dad and my Mother left my two siblings and me when I was 7. I've been going through severe phases of depression and suicidal thoughts, have taken Antidepressants for 3 years.
My girlfriend is suffering from a disease called Cystic Fibrosis(CF), Google it up because it is waaay to much to explain here. She is also suffering from depression and already attempted suicide 4 years ago because off the pressure from all people because of the CF. 
So she is going through a depression phase right now, and she leaves it all out to me. I really want to be there for her but I really can't stand it for longer because the more I'm talking to her about that all, the more she is distancing herself from me. She says  that she needs some space for herself, and I gave it to her and the she's distancing herself even more. 
This all leads to the problem that it pulls me back into my anxiety, i started thinking about death more than ever and how great it would be to stop it from hurting me.
And I can't just drive away because we already moved together (big mistake I think) and I have nobody I could drive to. I used to talk to her mom about this but my Gf forbid me doing it. She's pushing me away more every day. 
I know it's complicated but you can ask me what you want about it, I am really open and need your help because I don't know what to do.

depression,2020/02/28,"Feeling completely replaced &amp; is causing so much pain? Preface: my depression is already at the WORST it’s *ever* been this past month. This then happens and it crippled me. 

We were so close, for 3 years. He was the ONLY person I trusted and was close to. Last week we argued bc I got out of hospital and he (32M) didn’t visit me, instead talking to local girl (23F). I confronted him and he deleted her and said he wouldn’t even like her anyway because he doesn’t respect her job (online sex work).

He cut me off a few days later, ZERO EMOTION.. I went to drop my stuff off at him and he looked at me like I was a stranger, he walked off part way through the discussion about it and never spoke to me again. To me it’s unfinished conversation, to him it’s forgotten. 

Yes, he readded her, she blocked me, he blocked me, and he added the link to the same adult site she uses in his bio. (??) 

I’m devastated. It’s been 5 days and I sleep about 2-3 hours per night, cry excessively, and can barely eat a thing. I physically cannot face another week feeling THIS horrendous. My thoughts have got dark. On waiting list for NHS therapy, doctors know how low I am but can’t do much more than they are. 

I feel replaced and thrown away for new girl. Painful to know he probably is super taken with, as she very sexual like him, and thanks to my serious health issues I’ve been too sick to be sexual in a while :( he’s got his DREAM fantasy, and i’ve got my nightmare. 

Feel not good enough and like the loser here. I’m here inconsolable while they’re probably having a great time together, me not crossing his mind. I won’t even get closure let alone a apology. 

Just tell me how the hell to get over this. I can’t physically be sad about it for another second. I’m sick of crying. I’m in a lot of pain."

For the past 2 days I have been pissed because a friend of mine made a comment to me, it was more like being interrogated more and a ways of my sexual orientation, it's because I don't have a lot of sexual history. I go to bars, parties, and the internet, but I choose not push myself into sex until the right person comes along. I really want to have a good income, and i'm looking for maturity. Anyway back to the topic, I was talking to someone and she suddenly ghosts me, but I haven't talked to him in a while. I had been down due to my job, and I have seen how better off they are. We had talked about that, but we talked about why I distanced myself from them, and every time i'm around them they talk about how many bitches they fuck, and how much money they make and the extravagant lifestyle they have, and why i'm still single, and then I was asked if I was gay and I was pissed and offended by that. That was like a cheap shot, and it's because I never was into sports, and it was my taste in music, movies, television and my choice of being to myself. I have nothing against gays but I never had no luck with females, but I do admit I am a little jealous of their lifestyles and I wish I had some kind of stability in my own life. I decided to stay to myself because of that.**"

Today my coworkers had a “go out and eat and do some bowling” so I joined them, since I got no friends and it’s a good thing to go out and challenge my social anxiety.

I went, and they all laughed and had a good time. I felt so disconnected and lonely and empty the entire time. I had thoughts like “how can they think this is so fun” etc.

One of my coworkers when we did bowling, when I missed or did a bad go, or when I lost the round. She told me “aww, we playing for fun”, “nice try” etc. it just feels like she feel sorry for me and it sucks.

I been doubting my ability on my job lately as well, and on the way home I said something like “I wanna see if I get a full time job here, when my trial ends in September, before I move to x city” and one of them said very carefully “hopefully u get to stay” while, the rest was quite. A second before we talked about that, my other coworker in the backseat said she hopes she gets to stay, and all in the car agreed, and made sure she will.

I also work for my dad as a salesman because I don't want to push carts at a grocery store. And attractive women don't date cart pushers. 

Where I grew up in Colorado all the girls thought I was a loser and when I hung out with my friends my friends girlfriends think I'm a loser and it is because I'm ugly looking and fat.
 I now live in Massachusetts and I'm practically invisible to good looking women and I also don't have any friends here and I've lived here for 7 years I only have friends because I keep tabs and visit my once in Colorado.

I TOLD HER MY FEELINGS SHE REJECTED ME AND SHE TRIED SETTING ME UP WITH A FAT UGLY GIRL AFTER REJECTING ME. F**K MY LIFE. I HAVE THE WORST LIFE POSSIBLE

ALEX:
My prom date who I had a crush on for years made out with another dude in front of me and ran off to F**k him in his car and because she was from out of town she stayed over my place and the next morning after she invited him over so she can make out with him and in his car on my driveway amd people found out and I got humiliated all the way to graduation

SARA: 
The girl i had feelings for in high school but who friendzoned me is getting married  to a guy who is cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman. Hes an absolute scumbag. I truly hate him. He was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and has been caught texting other girls with intent to cheat multiple times. and now the girl I want is marrying him and **A TEACHER HERSELF**
She would use me as the shoulder to cry on and then when she was done crying to me she would have me go away and then she would go back to him after I'm not saying it wasn't my own fault but to some degree I was used emotionally

and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. 
Then five years ago when my mom passed away everybody I knew gave me their condolences even people I didn't like but they still were decent enough to tell me their condolences **EXCEPT HER** She didn't even give me a my condolences at the minimum despite her feeding me lies saying how me and her were such close good friends.  She couldn't even text me ""My condolences"" or ""Sorry for your loss"" not even 2 to 4 words in a text. I go to therapy **BECAUSE** of this experience. 

I then messaged her saying how it hurt me that she didn't say anything I told her how I felt about her I told her that her boyfriend now fiance is a scumbag I told her she's dumb for staying with a scumbag like that and the last thing she ever told me was
""F**k you loser sorry you're so mad at the world"" 

**THE WEEK MY MOM DIED!!!**

 last thing I ever said to her was ""how is that possible? I'm not a scumbag who cheats on you. Isn't that what you prefer to f**k?"" That was five years ago and we haven't spoken since. The wedding was in July

All my life women I've liked rejected me or ignored me. The only time women liked me they were morbidly obese and extremely unattractive but then I would be told to ""give them a chance that's your league anyways at least they're nice girls"" 😒 being told to take an L with a smile isn't a great life. Especially if you compare her to the women who rejected me. Their husbands and boyfriends (WHO I LOATHE) see that I'm with a woman much less unattractive after being rejected by them gives them a whole lot of leverage over me and that's absolutely humiliating for me like ""Haha my girl rejected you and you're stuck with an ugly woman. sucks to suck loser"". That is HUMILIATION defined, and everybody wants me to embrace this happening and it's NOT FAIR.

I'll be happy when a woman hotter than the women who rejected me loves me. Until then, ALL I EVER GOT WAS FUCKED OVER NO LUBE OR SPIT AND THEN PEOPLE TELL ME BE HAPPY FOR THE PEOPLE I HATE. TO JUST LIE DOWN AND TAKE IT AND THATS FUCKING BULLSHIT"

I hope this will help you realise it's OKAY to have bad days and to feel like you haven't made any progress. 
I hope it'll help you treat yourself more kindly, give yourself more leeway and give yourself hope that things will get better with time! 

I've always been a pessimist and never thought my disordered thoughts would get better, but since introducing some daily practices such as positive affirmations and gratitude (even though I didn't believe in them), and actively going against my thoughts, I've noticed my mentality is getting slowly better.

depression,2020/03/01,Depression and bad self esteem I’m a 32F in my first relationship with a man I love (28M) very much. My low self esteem and horrible self image are making myself and him crazy. I can’t seem to believe he loves me and is attracted to me despite numerous examples to the contrary. I also am much more emotional than even before. Does anyone in similar situations have any advice?
depression,2020/03/01,"22M cant keep any real friends how can I find some good friends, people who I connect with ?  
 I only have 1 true friend, and he's really hard to be with as he never wants to do much, and he complains a lot.  
 I would love to meet some more people, get a group of friends with who I could vibe with, an uplifiting group. I am currently in college and hopefully going to university next year. Im hoping in this change to meet some new people and possibly make my life more enjoyable, as i'm currently feeling really alone."
depression,2020/03/02,"Looking for job advice I'm a 27M (not in/from USA) and I am 100% lost now when it comes to future job/career.

I haven't worked much, very little in fact. I have worked full time in IT doing support.

I have extremely mixed feelings about IT. This is not only due to support kinda sucking, but also the business aspects That are unrewarding to me.

  
All I really know about ME is what I wrote below. I have no fucking clue which job title I am meant to pick based on this info.

I grew up with an aptitude for computers very early on. I would just screw around with them, reinstall the OS and learn the hardware. I probably understood this by age 8 or 9 or so. Don't know exactly.

I never became much of a programmer. I know the basics of python and Java / android but while I enjoyed the projects at the time, I didn't go on spending my time on loads of programming projects and stuff. I just started a course on iOS development which I like but I am not hyperfocused on it. I do like it tho but I need a little push.

I am very good with hardware, overclocking etc. I learn concepts that interest me very quickly. I have done every out of the box thing out there. I have done hackintosh but also much more out there kind of stuff. I fucked around with software defined radio (just first thing that jumped in my head). I successfully on first attempt delided a PS3 CPU and GPU with a scalpel. But the list is endless. Just little projects I get super interested in and then POOF. Completed it so no more interest. 😔

I am good mechanically. I can fix almost all things on bicycles and probably some simple stuff on cars. Fix loads of shit around the house. I can solder and do simple repairs on electronics. Spent quite a bit of time on RC cars and other RC stuff and can do all of it. All self taught. I love doing shit like this.

I have a bachelor degree but don't give a fuck about it. I never really enjoyed studying. I was mostly interested in my little side projects I would come up with rather than study.

Also love cars and love driving. F1 is a new interest.

Music saves lives or at least is a higher form of language. I am not at all interested in virtuose / technical playing.

I also think quite a lot. I like Joe Rogan and Sam Harris (podcasts). I have also enjoyed learning about Jordan B Peterson but don't hold his worldview. I find psychology intriguing and would be interested in helping others but I feel like I would only be good at helping some people. Others might come with problems where I think WTF but I am required to show empathy etc. Which would probably fail.

I guess I am an introvert. If I feel I have nothing to say, id rather say nothing. I really enjoy working alone. I like spending time with people that are nice to hang out with, or think loud Nigra is an acceptable form of humor.

What the fuck do I do lol?"
depression,2020/03/02,"The only way from here is down I'll try keep this short.

I'm a 30M. Grew up with quite the screw up of a family, but through the depression (I didn't know I had it at the time) I managed to get through uni (accounting) and music college (grade 8).

Life went up and down from there. Got the perfect job, screwed it up. Found the perfect partner, same story.

2 years ago was the worst though. I lost my wife and stepchild all of a sudden to another man. No warning. All this after losing another dream job.

It's been nothing but drinking, screwing up, and just drifting from there. My father took pity, took me in, and gave me a job (minimum wage). Things are different this time though. I have ambition to even go get out and get fucked on weekends anymore. I don't randomly meet women on tinder anymore. 

I work at this point only to support my 2 Addictions: Xanax and morphine. It's the only thing that gets me through the day. Sure, some nights I have the strength to work on music (even got involved with an underground drum n bass label at one point, but I deleted all social accounts apart from Reddit because it's anonymous so I've got no personal contact anymore. I don't even have a personal SoundCloud anymore.)

My rhetorical question is this; is this it? Will I just forever go on like this? Working just to support my habit? Making music at times, taking my drugs daily and playing some RPG's at night? Sure, I'm on 2 antidepressants, but they do nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

Do I attempt to kill myself again? (My dad caught me, I'm not going into detail as to not give people ideas how easy it can be if you have the correct resources) or do I just fuck on the way I am doing now? I have no ambition to get better. None. I don't want to be happy again. I... I just want to not be. 

I don't even know where I'm going with this. I'm tired. I'm at an age where my friends and family my age are all career driven, having kids, and here I am. Looking forward to my next valium and/or Xanax and morphine combo. 

What do you do when you don't want to get better? But you're stuck in a rut? Most of you seem to give such great advice so I figured I'd post here... Thanks for reading my rant."
depression,2020/03/02,"I (18M) am starting to feel depressed again after 6.5 years On mobile, sorry for long post and bad formatting. The past few weeks have been shit.

Context:
I was bullied in primary school by people who used to be my friends, I was depressed and often thought about suicide. once the bullying stopped in year 7 (6.5 years ago) and I went to highschool I thought that I had overcome my depression as I was happier and wasn't having anymore suicidal thoughts although i had severe social anxiety.

I have not been a Christian since year 7 because of the bullying and had been struggling with that until a few months ago when I was finally able to admit it to my parents

My parents are Christian and have been together since they were in highschool. My dad had cancer when I was 1 and has chronic back pain as a result and has been basically an absent father my entire life, as when he isnt working, he is on his phone or sleeping. My mum is the mission leader for our church.

last month I went on a mission trip with my mum and brother to indonesia, and someone from Indonesia came with us to bali for a holiday at the end of the trip, before we returned home. I went on the trip because my mum had said to everyone at church that I was going before I had told her whether or not I wanted to go, and didn't want to embarrass her by not going, even though I didn't want to.

the person who had come with us has been in contact with my mum for years and they constantly talk to each other and there is an age difference of 20+ years.

What happened:
When we came back from the mission trip, my mum said that my dad and her were getting a divorce because of some of the things my dad has done and  she has been silently dealing with the fact that she doesn't love my dad anymore. She says she has been dealing with this for the last year and that she finally came to terms with having to get a divorce. we found out the same day as our dad. The next day I went to a friends place and that night I got the most drunk I have ever gotten and hated myself for it.

My dad kept coming over and actually started to make an effort in being a part of our lives while also subtlety hinting that part of the reason they were getting divorced was our fault without realizing he was doing it.

after a week of processing the divorce I found out that my mum had actually slept with the person who came with us for the holiday and that they want to pursue a relationship together. I found out this from my dad who had to actively ask what happened and why the apparent suddenness of it all.

Today my dad vented and yelled at us and I had a minor panic attack and realised that I am starting to feel depressed again.

before all this I was really excited to start going to a university that is much closer than the one I went to last year and has a much better course, reputation and employability after graduating from there. Now I'm finding it difficult to have the effort to do anything, let alone go to university.

I want to go to a therapist but am afraid to ask as my parents are not going to work because of this, and don't have enough money and I don't either."
depression,2020/03/03,"I don't know what to do. I'm 15M. Recently, even though I'm very much a spoiled boy, I mean like a nice computer, nice girlfriend, nice life, I'm super depressed. I also have anger issues and have been lashing out. I do not know what to do. I feel like I don't have the right to be depressed because I have all of the nice things. I don't know how to feel anymore. I hurt mentally and talking to my parents has been tried before. No results."
depression,2020/03/03,"How to make people notice and want to talk with you? (17M) So it's been three extremely hard months for me (since November), but I am finally winning this battle against depression, panic attacks and anxiety (which basically caused them all). But I have a thing which needs to be explained to me in order to feel free of anxiety for good.

So I am having a social anxiety, which basically means (in my case) that I never know what to say to people and what to talk about. Then I noticed: there are a very very (2 or 3) few people with whom I don't experience this. Spending time with these particular people (classmates in high school) feels brutally awesome, and makes me think that everything is possible. 

Then I started thinking: how do they differ from all of those other people? After many years, I figured out. The answer is: with them, I can be myself. I can talk with them about anything I want, anywhere I want. They are interested in me, and I am not the only one who keeps the conversation going. And that's the key! 

So my question is: since I can't be free and act truly as myself if I am not around people who actually ""need"" or ""like"" my prescence, how can I meet new people, or make friendships with those who I really like, but they would just rather spend time with others? (If I want to make friendships, I must be the one who initiates a talk. They don't just come to me, wanting to talk or to have fun. But how can I achieve that?) It just feels like a paradox situation."
depression,2020/03/04,"I (19M) feel like I'm reaching a breaking point. I've been feeling depressed af the last few months, it sort of feels like a relapse after about 6 months of a reasonably healthy mental state.

Basically I feel physically drained of energy all day, I have zero motivation to study or try in any way whatsoever in college. I'm doing a notoriously tough course and barely passed my Christmas exams. I come home exhausted but when I go to bed I just become really agitated and irritated. My heart starts pounding and I struggle to breathe, I can't get comfortable and even if go to bed exhausted at 8/9pm I wouldn't get to sleep until 2/3am.  However in the mornings I struggle so much to get out of bed, I feel like there's almost zero point getting up anyway as I wouldn't even miss out on anything. I end up missing so many of my lectures simply becuase I cannot bring myself to get out of bed. I still live at home going to college but if I lived by myself without parents I could see myself just staying in bed/my room for days at a time. 

Every day passes by in a sort of blur for me, I feel like I almost have a depersonalization disorder as I just operate in autopilot. I feel like a shell, it's almost like I'm just empty inside; I don't feel emotions, everything just feels monotonous and numb.  Honestly I really just don't give a fuck about anything anymore. I used to have passions like playing music/sport/reading/films etc but nothing excites me anymore. I feel like I don't really have an emotional outlet, it's like I'm just existing day-to-day without actually living. Since I find close to zero pleasure in general life I self-medicate with weed; I guess it's just a coping mechanism in order to feel something other than numb. I also think I have memory loss, as the last couple months have really blurred, I honestly don't know where the time has gone or what I've been doing in that time. 

I also have really really bad eating habits, I don't generally eat breakfast and then could go the day without eating. However when I come home I often would binge until I struggle to breathe. 

I also feel socially exhausted every day I have to go into college; pretending to be someone I'm not is mentally draining as I feel like I'm putting on a fake persona just to mask the numbness when all I wanna do is just go to bed/get high. This is probably part of the reason I avoid going to lectures. 

This all eventually caused me to go to the student couseling services in my college sometime last week, however I feel like I wasnt as honest as I should have been regarding my situation, I was definitely making it out to be less severe than it actually is. They set me up with counselling sessions that start in 3 weeks. 

However I feel like my ability to function has been severely impaired in the last few days. Tonight I felt the urge to self-harm for the first time and honestly if I had clean razors I would already have done so. I don't think I can wait 3 weeks for my counselling appointment, I feel like I should go to a GP/psychiatrist and see what they think. I feel like I just want someone to tell me exactly what I have, I'm 99% sure it's depression, and perhaps symptomatic  insomnia/a binge eating disorder. I guess part of me still denies it's depression despite me knowing that it almost certainly is and I feel like I need a medical professional to tell me how it is in order for me to be able to work on getting better. I guess I also want to see if they think that medication could help too. Ultimately I just want treatment as soon as possible, something concrete I can show to myself to tell me that I'm taking steps to improve myself as atm I feel so lost in life, and I feel like a breakingpoint might come soon unless I change things. 

I really don't know where to go from here, I guess this post is just a reflection. Maybe I just want to get my thoughts down somewhere but if anyone has any advice obviously I'd rly appreciate that: like most ppl here I just wanna feel normal again. :( If anyone would be willing to talk about things a bit more in detail I'd appreciate a pm."
depression,2020/03/04,"How do I unisolate myself when I have the energy to do nothing? Commute, work, commute, sleep. That’s pretty much my life right now. I feel tired every day can’t get anything done in my personal life. I can’t even game or watch anime anymore I’m so damn tired. Couple that with very intense loneliness that I’ve felt my whole life (22M never had a girlfriend) and you have me. I’ve found that throughout my life people just lose interest in me and always end up leaving. It’s always just a matter of time.. I mean it’s understandable as all I do is sleep and work I guess. Honestly I can’t take it anymore I just want something to change, whatever the hell it may be. I want to feel connected with someone... I want all these things that I can’t have because I just can’t bring myself to get them"
depression,2020/03/04,"Boyfriend (30M) ended things with me (27F) due to depressive episode? Had no idea he dealt with depression New to reddit, I hope I’m ok to post here and not breaking any rules

My boyfriend of 2 years and I have had an overall happy relationship. We had one breakup last summer for a month or so due to him being unable to communicate well, but since getting back together things have been great. We saw each other last week and everything was normal, we made plans to spend Saturday together.  

Saturday, I texted him twice during the day and got no reply. By 9pm, I was pretty annoyed and over reacted a bit, I sent 3 texts asking what was going on/expressing frustration that we were dealing with the same lack of communication as before. Sunday morning, he responds saying “clearly this isn’t working” and tells me that he was struggling with a depressive episode Saturday and was unable to even find the energy to text me. 

I feel horrible, he has never indicated to me that this was a struggle he dealt with. He’s told me before sometimes he gets into “funks” but never anything like this. If I knew, I would have definitely backed off. He accused me of always making him feel guilty. I asked him to please not make the decision to end our relationship based on a misunderstanding, as I can only react to the information I had, and to please tell me if he wants to be with me, and that I will give him the space he wants/needs to recover. He never responded to that message, so I assume we are broken up. I have not tried to contact him since. (This is probably silly to add, but he has also been avoiding all of my social media stories, which is out of character for him.)

I have never dealt with depression, so I’m not sure what protocol is here. I guess I’m just looking for how I can reach out (if I should), let him know I’m here for him, or get him to understand that I would never want to pressure him or negatively affect his mental health. I’m blindsided because a week ago we were talking about our future, and now he is acting like I don’t exist. 

TL;DR I over reacted to my BF not responding to my texts when we had plans, he tells me he was dealing with a depressive episode and that I was guilting him and ended things. I’m blindsided and desperate to fix this."
depression,2020/03/04,"I feel like I am not enough I (16M) feel useless, unneeded and not enough for anyone. Sure it may seem like I am just a teenager seeking attention but that is the exact reason I am reaching out to reddit and not to my friends . I feel like I am not enough for anyone anywhere. I’m never anyone’s number one choice. Every single person has someone else to go to before me. I am not my “Best friend’s” (16 F) best friend. She has about 5 people she’d tell before me. I have always kept a small friends circle and slowly it has shrunk so small I do not have anyone to talk to on a personal level. For about a year I’ve felt like I am of no use to anyone. I can never do the rights things. Everyone in out class gets into relationships and bromances but I get left out. Relationships may not seem like a necessity but I know for a fact no person has ever had a crush/interest in a friendship with me. I feel like ending it all but the thought of people thinking that “We could’ve helped” worries me. I feel really alone. I don’t know what to do."
depression,2020/03/04,"Really like feeling on giving up So me (18M) have been dealing for a long period 
of time with depressive episodes. When I was around 15 I went to a psychologist for a year. It helped, but clearly not long enough. I have been getting depressive episodes more rapidly and more extreme. Its beginning to take a toll on me, I'm tired and desperate. I honestly dont known what to do. Going back to a psychologist is really hard for me because even though it did help, some things happened and it really gave me some trust issues because of it. Any one who can help me a bit with this?"
depression,2020/03/04,"I’m gonna try and get some help Hi everyone. I’m a 21M just for reference. Anyways, I’ve been stuck in a long depression since about this time 2 years ago. Why I exactly started feeling that way, I’m not really sure, but I stopped caring about my job, about my health, basically about anything but smoking weed, getting drunk and hanging with my girlfriend at the time. At first I just felt that I was kind of out of the loop, but then I just felt worse and worse everyday. Suicidal thoughts, feelings of inadequacy, really unsure about my future etc. and I began to realize I was probably depressed. 

For all of 2019 it was basically a really bad year for me. I was stuck at a dead endjob I hated, not going to school or having some type of future I believed in, completely hopeless and desperate for love while I was single and failing miserably at trying, and in the worst physical shape of my life. My confidence has practically dropped to non-existent. At the moment I’m jobless since I got fired from my last job, and I don’t even have the motivation to look for work. All I ever want to do is lay in my bed and sleep. And then on top of it a girl I really really liked broke my heart and it’s really tearing me apart to see her with another guy.

So the way I’ve been feeling is just ready to die. I think about killing my self far too much. So I’m finally taking the opportunity to get myself help before it’s too late. I’m gonna talk to my mom openly about how I feel and see what options I can take to help myself. I really just want to be better and stop feeling this way. I’d just like to say I would appreciate the support from everyone here because it means the world to know I’m not alone in this."
depression,2020/03/05,"Getting work done when Depression is telling you that you can’t do anything and you’re worth nothing kills me. (Unfortunately not literally) Hey. 16M here. I’m just a wee little high schooler but I feel like I’ve been through a whole ass war with my own fucking brain. For context, my depression got intense at around 7th-9th grade. Finally it’s started to slow down and I don’t want to kill myself as much as I did in middle school. But not everything’s is so hunky dory. I don’t know if I’m alone on this and I doubt I am, but it’s so hard to get motivated to do anything but play video games and smoke weed. Now I know I’ll probably be told that the weed isn’t helping with my motivation, which it isn’t, but that isn’t the issue. My issue is that I don’t have any drive to want to better myself or to do anything other than what is fun to me. Am I alone here? Is this because of something other than my depression? 

I never do homework, I never study, and these days it’s actually affecting all of my grades and that kills me because I could get away with doing *some* of my homework and get amazing grades on tests and 9 times out of 10 I’d pass with a C or above. But now I’m getting Fs in my classes and I just want to quit. I can’t find a reason to continue being in this useless place we call school for my “education”. Anyway, you probably have something better to do than to talk to me so, I’d better get back to “work”."
depression,2020/03/05,"Any website or resource for learning common skills that I'd need in jobs (or everyday life)? (x-post from /r/FindAPath) Posting here too since I'm suffering from pretty severe depression and nothing seems to help. I need to get a job soon or I'll go broke, and I feel so unprepared for anything I'll get. Even the career conference at my college the other day seemed to go poorly. I had brain fog going in and I have no idea what the recruiters think of me. Feeling pretty hopeless tbh, and my parents and fiance are losing patience it feels like. Feeling stuck in life and that I'm going to have to take a job that will only make me feel worse :(

22M. So I've always done pretty well in school, my grades have only ever plummeted when I literally decided not to do work (frequently), but I think I've always had less common sense than others. Growing up I was always awkward or knew less common things than my peers. I've only had a couple jobs, not any really in retail, and I have a degree in IT/Software Development so my daily tasks are likely to be much different than those I'd be doing in retail. Regardless, I'm afraid of being incompetent at easy tasks during work, since it's happened a few times. Best example I can think of: was asked to mop something up, tried mopping (seemed self explanatory, just drag mop head over mess) but did it wrong (tried for about 30 sec, wasn't using any force downwards to actually scrub the mess, had it taken away from me [lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI5o939LHrE)). Felt embarrassed and like a failure afterwards, because who doesn't know how to mop? These things made me feel awkward around my co-workers, because I was clearly less competent than them at basic tasks, and I never fit in or made friends regardless (not much in common and I live 20 min outside of town).

Some people might call these kinds of skills (chores, adult responsibilities, things that are common knowledge, etc.) ""adulting"" skills, but I kind of hate that term. I've been sheltered a lot of my life and have never had the opportunity to learn them. I don't want to blame my parents, but I've hardly had any responsibilities or means of learning how to do things properly outside of what I've learned online or in school. Is there a site or list somewhere of things I should learn to be helpful in jobs? I would have never thought to look up or ask how to use a mop, since it's never taught and everyone just seems to know, but obviously I had to.

I'd like to learn some common things as I feel useless in that regard. A lot of things are easier said than done, yet I think this would be helpful for me. Almost like a HowItsMade site or youtube channel for people that are lost in life."
depression,2020/03/05,"19M Need Help Badly in Relationships Before I start I do got to say that I do not struggle with girls becoming interested in me since most of RateMe and many other places rate me at about 7.5-8 out of 10 for a male which is about average.
My main problem is keeping their interest in me.
A little background on me, I don't have many hobbies,dropped out of HS because of social anxiety and deppression,fathers dead,still living with mother, have no car nor license,and have no motivation whatsoever. So my life's a mess. 
So compared to most my age I'm lacking in pretty much everything, especially confidence. No friends really, so I'm mostly alone and feel like dying.
Thats why I came here, I need advice and need it bad because soon I'm afraid I'm going to hurt myself because this pain keeps breaking me down and down and I don't know where to turn. 
So any help would be appreciated. I'm just so close to ending it I just need someone to talk to right now."
depression,2020/03/05,Probably gonna give up tonight I (22M) am probably gonna give up tonight. I had a rough day at work and I kinda snapped at my younger brother and cousin. My mom told me I was a pathetic person and it made me realize that I really am just a pathetic fuck up. I have been trying to keep it together and not let my depression take over but I think I’ve just about lost that battle. I have a note written out and everything.

depression,2020/03/07,"I don’t know what to feel I [19M] constantly feel empty and emotionless. I’m not sure why. I fail to see any purpose in my life and very often get sudden moments where I feel like just crying or running away from everyone and everything. I don’t like who I am at all, and it always feels like nobody else does either. In the past I’ve had problems with drinking and feel like it’s soon going to resurface. I don’t even feel like being awake anymore. I just try to keep myself busy with work and stuff at home because I know there are people who feel stronger than me and hurt themselves etc, therefore I almost feel like my mental state isn’t justified. I’m sorry if this is an inappropriate place to post this, it’s just that I have really nowhere else to write or talk about it. 

My friends have kept slipping away from me and getting girlfriends, spending their time with them. I barely have the motivation or energy to even get out of my bed or meet people anymore. It’s getting harder to even see the point in being alive. I hope this doesn’t sound too emotional or dramatic, I just don’t know how to word it any differently."
depression,2020/03/07,"Anti-depressants have ruined so many good things for me (24M) I don't rant very often, but I'd like to share my personal experience regarding what anti-depressants have done to me as an individual.

I began taking Lexapro in 2018 because I had symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts. It took a long time for the medication to work, but unfortunately it caused me terrible stomach problems. My anxiety has been terrible since I was a kid. I needed to figure it out. So late last November I switched to Prozac.

Worst idea of my life.

I started dating this wonderful girl who was independent and sweet and empathetic with me, which helped me sometimes feel like I could fight my mental health problems, but when the medication started ramping up in December, I started throwing and breaking things, and eventually we got into physical altercations. 

I have NEVER in my life been in a fight with another human being. I'm a small guy, I don't like confrontation, and I don't appreciate when people are irrationally violent.

Well, Prozac made me absolutely *violent.* It is still coming out of my system and I can feel it lessening everyday, but I still can't seem to hold down the  rage. I can't stop myself from having knee-jerk reactions to even little things like what I hear or what people say to me.

I am in so much pain because this medication isn't helping me control *anything* like my doctor promised. I'm going to start therapy in hopes to curb this, but I haven't had these issues since I was ten or eleven years old. 

Back in September I was happy, but anxious, and sometimes fell into depression, but I got out of it. I don't want to try anymore medication. I was perfectly fine just taking the hits and dealing with it on my own, but Prozac made me feel like I had no control. I still sometimes feel like I don't.

Props to my girlfriend (27F), for she hasn't left me while I struggle with this, but I'm feeling like an outcast too. I've slept on the couch for two weeks as punishment from her. I tell her how I feel and she says ""I wonder why"" and then tells me to prove I can be different. I just want this bullshit to stop! I'm so done feeling like this. I want the pain to stop and I just want to be me again."

I was wondering if there are any guys or girls have had similar experience and if so did it affect you as much as i think it will"
depression,2020/03/09,"Cheated by the only girl ive ever loved. I'm 21M. I have always been the quite kind of person who never really socialised a lot. I had a few good friends and was alone for the most part of my life. Untill I got into college. Into my second year, one of my seniors who I was working on a project with started hitting on me and I fell in love with her naively (given that it was the first time I wasn't cautious).
Later i found out that she played a dirty truth and dare came with a friend of mine while we were dating and I felt cheated. Upon probing I found out about her past. 
I don't know which part of the world you are reading this, or how your culture shapes your perspective, but I come from a conservative society. Here the concept of casual relationships and premarital sex is still a taboo. 
I found out that she had had many fuck buddies, she used to post nudes online and send nudes and I also found out that she had a best friend with whom she was having an online casual relationship while we dated. She asked me for an open relationship and all these stuff that I never knew existed. All I knew was find a girl, love her, marry her.
Nevertheless this broke me inside. I felt weak and like I don't matter. Like I'm not enough. It's been more than a year and the feelings still lurk in me. However she has changed. She has become loyal and caring about me. I can't leave her just because she had a bad past.
However I don't know how to get out of this hole. I've tried everything. My mind got messed up in the process. Now I'm a cuckold and like to watch my gf get used by others. I wish to become normal again. But pain has become my normal mood.
And I'm so tired, at this point I just let the pain eat me away. I've faught it for so many months. I tried Buddhism, but it only distracted me for sometime. When my mind is idle, I start to think about how my gf used to be someone else's, how she had another important man, how she had someone else who she used to always talk to, share her life with and make memories with. More than the sex, it's the fact that she got so emotionally close to someone else that hurts.
Many times I just feel like dying since I see no way out of this. I can't break up with her, I've tried many times. I'm just trapped here and left to rot."
depression,2020/03/09,"I (22M) feel like I’m at the lowest I’ve ever been (friends &amp; relationships) (solopreneur) I’ve slowly lost all my friends, I don’t feel happy with my girlfriend anymore, I miss my ex, and I feel so so empty...

Those all happened in chronological order. 

While my past friends have all moved on in their lives through university or work, they’ve made new friends, met new people and found some sort of a “happy place” in their lives. As a solopreneur who doesn’t go to university or work in a traditional environment, I haven’t gained these friendships. As a result, all my friends have moved on and I’m left being “that guy” asking everyone to outings when everyone is busy with their new friendships. 

I’ve always been the type of person to delve in the past and think about all the good times that happened. This is why I’m always trying so hard to bring those “good times” back that apparently no one else wants. This was the beginning of my downwards spiral so to say and leads to what happened next...

Being the super sentimental (is that the right word?) person that I am, I really wanted to rekindle the past relationships I had and not lose touch. I have connected with several friends that I had previously lost touch with. 

But I also decided to reach out to an ex.

As you might have see from the title, yes, I do have girlfriend at the moment. However, for some unknown reason to me, I really REALLY want to reconnect with this ex-girlfriend and form a friendship. I thought that I had a lot in common with her and that we connected very well. This sort of connection might be something that I feel I lacking in my current relationship. 

But after reaching out, I received no reply. I have no idea if she read my message or if she’s changed her number or what. 

While I do see her around every once in a while, it’s such a rare occurrence and it’s always from afar. Plus, I’m pretty shy so it’s hard to muster up the courage to speak to her if I see her unexpectedly. 

This happening, in addition to how I feel about losing all my friends, it’s killing me. 

I feel like I’m in a hole that I can’t get out of. I try to bury myself in more work, starting new activities, and exercising more. I still feel like absolute shit. 

My assumption was that reaching out to my ex to reconnect would be the answer to helping me get out of this emotional hole that I’m in. But it never even crossed my mind that she would completely ignore my message (or that I wouldn’t be able to reach her)...

Reddit, what do I do? Where did it all go wrong? Plus, would it be wrong for me to send a follow up message to my ex again or through a different medium (I used 2 already).

Bonus details:

- dating current gf for around 2 years
- haven’t spoken to ex for over 2 years
- tried rekindling friendships for 1+ years and it hasn’t improved one bit"

I \[28M\] met the **most amazing woman of the face of the Earth \[18F\] about two months ago. She is super sweet, kind, smart, funny, drop-dead gorgeous, and a dream to spend time with.** We originally met just to hookup, however we connected and she became an amazing friend. **By far the best thing to ever happen to me in my entire life**, no question. We weren't bf/gf, **we were us**, no labels. We hung out, went on dates, explored the city, and generally just spent time together, and it was so fun and felt so good. Age gap is a thing, I understand, I wasn't expecting a relationship or anything, but if it turned to that I wouldn't say I'd be adverse. We had talked before about the age gap and she said that it wasn't really a problem. Anyway, the other day I received a text from her that she thinks we shouldn't see each other anymore, that things were going too fast and she wasn't comfortable or ready for it. Two hours before this she responded to a cute meme I sent her that was a ""cuddle coupon"" and she said she would be using it a lot. How it goes complete 180 turn in such a short time, **FUCK MY LIFE**. Frankly I'm devastated, I never intended to rush anything, in fact I was more than content being friends. I can't help but feel that I did something or said something that ruined it, and **I hate myself for causing the end of the best thing that has ever happened to me**. I feel like I was being toxic or asking for too much without realizing it. I am in so much pain. Now I am planning on improving myself, mainly to try and numb the pain, also hoping that our paths cross once again. **I place no blame on her, if she thinks its over, then I guess its over**, I respect her feelings. But god I feel so bad and miss her so much, **I'm afraid to sleep at night because I dream about her and feel even worse**. I cant focus on work, or family or anything, I've basically been crying nonstop. I feel like such a baby and such a burden. ""Why would she want to hang out with me anyway?"" I think to myself. Its so fucking painful. **I was truly, genuinely, happy for once in my life and now its over.** I fucking ruined it.  **I would do anything to be friends with her once again.** Her birthday is coming up and I think I'm gonna send her a card, which is probably the stupidest fucking thing imaginable, but I want to do it anyway. Well yeah, I kinda just wanted to vent, but I'm interested to hear about what yall think too.

depression,2020/03/10,"My (34M) wife (33F) just moved out. Depressed and pushing me away? My wife has been struggling to find happiness for over  a year now. She couldn’t decide if she was unhappy because of us or just unhappy in general. It has been a year of her putting extremely limited effort into the relationship and then pulling back once things seem to be improving. Does this sound like depression taking over or should I just let her go and start over?

Interesting note: she started taking cymbalta/duloxetine this past weekend. I’ve read that this will take 6-8 weeks to begin really helping with her views of the world. Am I silly to think it will change her view of us?

We went to counseling last February and she told the therapist she never loved me and pretty much forced our entire relationship. I know she loved at one point, but her views are so jaded now. 

Appreciate some feedback with others that have experienced similar!"

depression,2020/03/11,"Lost hope. 

19M

I was completely normal until 5 months ago. 

Was sitting in a car then it just felt like my heart stopped. I lost hearing for a second then had constant adrenaline the next day. Muscle twitching that I’ve never had before. Lost 30lbs in 2 months. Had 2 seizures. Palpitations 

4 months into doctors visit and 1 month into Prozac nothing is helping and even doctors are puzzled about what’s going on. 

Everytime I lay down a muscle twitches. It sucks. My memory is so bad, I don’t feel like I’m living in reality. If I kill myself right now I feel like there would be no repercussions.

Doctors are sending me to Mayo Clinic. 

This is just too much to deal with on my own. I have no family. Provide for myself. This sucks. Just a venting post honestly. If I really wanted to kill myself id go do it right now. I’m about 60% there"

depression,2020/03/12,"My BF [32M] has severe depression and I [26F] don't know how to help. Suggestions? My BF has rarely been open with me about his depression until it comes out during a fight (usually as an explanation for his behavior when I didn't realize that's what was going on). I hate that I don't know how to deal with it. 

He typically spirals and can spend days, weeks, or months on a downward path of not getting anything done and being extremely sensitive or irritated.

I have tried to ask him/talk to him about it but he doesn't want to. I usually get mildly upset if he snaps at me and don't have the patience that I would like for handling his bad moods. 

How do your spouses support you in a positive way? What can I do that won't make it worse or push him away? I'm not the best at taking car office people but I'm trying to learn.

TL;DR My BF struggles with depression and I need suggestions for how to handle it and support him."
depression,2020/03/12,"32M. Finalizing divorce. So, at this point I'm done wallowing in pity. I'm done repeating myself over and over, with no one to listen.

By the time I was 20, half of my family was dead. 

By the time I was 25, I was a young father with two kids.

By 30, their mother had terminated my parental rights. I had met a wonderful woman who helped me heal from unimaginable trauma and depression.

Now, at 32, that woman, my wife, has left me. My beat friend of 15 years is gone, too.

I've been to counselors and psychologists. There's nothing really *wrong* with me. I've been told time and time again that I do not need medication. 

But here I am. Alone. Angry. Sad. My growth, as a person, amounted to nothing. Being better, meant nothing. Every single fuckin time I try, life kicks me in the nuts and I have to start all over again.

And I'm tired of this song and dance. I'm just waiting for her divorce to be final. Shes happy. She found someone right away. I dont have anyone, and cant find anyone. And even if I did, they wouldn't be her. 

Even she isnt who I thought.

Just days ago we went out to a party and everything was good, we held hands, kissed, joked and laughed like we normally do. The constant reassurance, love, support, and affection she gives me in light of my feelings makes me feel even more guilty even though I shouldn’t.

depression,2020/03/18,"I’m (29M) suffering from my wife’s (29F) depression The title sounds more selfish than I mean it, but some part of it is selfishness I suppose. My wife is extremely depressed and borderline suicidal. Since a miscarriage a couple years ago she has lost her best friend, painfully watched many other friends get pregnant, lost her job, and recent tests confirm lost many hormones as well (low estrogen). I’m not sure how long it’s been hormonal but I know our situation is dire. 


I’m currently a grad school student contributing nothing to this family but debt. It’s too intense of a program to have an actual job but I do work on a small contract type basis. My wife does not have a degree and since losing her job (business closed) has done everything to find another job worth more than minimum wage without luck. She’s an amazing worker but there’s just nothing even available here. She feels worthless and like she cannot contribute to society or anyone else. We also had to move in with her parents to afford things right now so we are in a bad spot with everything. With this new virus who knows when she will be able to find good, fulfilling work. 

In short, she feels like she’s 30 with nothing to show for it and nothing at all what she planned (losing our baby). We have no idea when things or how they will change. We can’t afford therapy and even when I’m done with school next May we will have so many bills to settle before feeling like we can try for a family again. I feel like I caused all of this going to grad school. I wish I could stop or go back in time but that I’m too deep to quit now with student loans and what I will make once I’m out compared to quitting. There’s absolutely no solution for my wife. 

Now you’re caught up. I try everything I can to make her feel better but I’m just watching her slip deeper and deeper into depression. Away from family and friends who don’t care enough. Away from myself who cares but causes some of it in her mind. And hearing her talk about suicide makes me want to kill myself it hurts so much to hear. I have no idea what to do. How do I address having nothing at 30? Any positive spin I try to put on her makes her upset or feel invalidated but not doing so just let’s me agree and suffer with her. I’m so defeated from being helpless to make my wife happier when that’s all I want in the world anymore."
depression,2020/03/19,"I need serious help right now... depression from losing ex girlfriend (24M) I need serious help like right this minute but I have no one to talk to. I'm home with my mom during this coronavirus crisis but I don't dare reveal my extreme depression and near suicidal-ness to her. She already has her own problems and would be a wreck if I ever was honest with her about how I'm feeling. 

The sudden social isolation has made it 10 times worse because now I realize I have nothing. Literally nothing. The college routine kept me busy but without that I'm going mentally insane. My depression over my past breakup has returned. 

I was with a girl for a year but due to my problems at that time (family tragedy, depression, porn and marijuana addiction, etc.) I treated her badly at times even though the love was real. It's been a year since she broke it off but the pain has gotten worse with every passing month as I realize more and more how badly I fucked up. I've talked to her in the past few months but she mostly either ignores me or says horrible things to me now (she says the same story of things I said to her at my lowest points). Additionally she keeps arguing with me and telling me things like I am extremely selfish and will never make it anywhere, and I never said anything like that to her. The thing is, she doesn't know about my depression and addictions and personal problems while we were together. I kept them hidden and I've always been too ashamed to tell ANYONE. Now it's eating me up inside, because while I've gotten better I'm still struggling some days, and I need to tell someone.

I need to tell her the truth about me. She's convinced I'm just a bad person who treated her badly intentionally; she doesn't know how badly I loved her and won't accept my words when I tell her how sorry I am about everything. 

I finally told her today I need to tell her the truth about why I was the way I was (things I never told her), but she again just insulted me with nastiness and it appears she may have blocked my number now. 

I've never self harmed but for the first time in my life I feel close. I cannot focus on anything. I'm trembling. I have fucked up so much and I hurt her so bad and I cannot ever forgive myself for it. I'm very close to doing something bad because I have no reason to go on with life anymore. She was my everything and I didn't realize it and I fucked everything up. I don't want to go on anymore. I need the pain to end."

depression,2020/03/22,"My sister is quite depressed and I don't know how to help Hey, 24M here, my sister 31F is suffering from severe depression. She does see a therapist but I don't know how helpful that is. She took up science in school and stuck with it till post grad and became a biomed science graduate. What she tells me is that she sucked at it and the pay was shit so eventually she couldn't take it anymore and left her job. It's been 2 months now and she's been sitting at home. Her passion lies in music and honestly she's pretty fucking good at it. But considering she's 31 now and out of job, I get worried seeing that she's just lost the will to do anything at all. I've asked her if she can upload some stuff on streaming services like YouTube and SoundCloud and see if she finds success there but she just won't do it. I don't earn but I supported her through her last few months of her job so that she could save enough money for herself and have some financial independence once she quit. But since then she just stays at home. I wouldn't call her lazy, but I think her confidence and self belief have taken a hit. I don't believe she should stick around and hustle in a field she's not interested in just to have some form of income, but I also know that staying at home isn't gonna help in any way. What should I do ? I'm not from a well off family so my father can't support her once he stops earning. I'm in med school so ill be earning soon but that ain't gonna be enough either. I don't like to bring this up and make her feel like I'm pressuring her to do something, it's just that I don't know how I can help her get her life back on track.

TL;DR - my sister's depressed and I'm not sure how I can help."
depression,2020/03/22,"How to deal with liking someone you know you can’t be with? Im a 19M and i work in a school. For some reason i started to really like a 16 year old girl who attends there, she has no idea nor does anyone else for i would never be so stupid as to act on these feelings because i know it would be illegal. I have no attraction for young girls either so I’m not some sort of sick individual. 

Due to the coronavirus the schools have shut and it will likely be 6 months before they reopen. As she was in her final year she has now left. How can i deal with these feelings as it has left me deeply depressed, i know that i can never get with the girl but i cant help how i feel, knowing that I might never see her again is really playing on my emotions and I can’t go 20 minutes without thinking about her.

Never had a girlfriend nor a date.

Was rejected by everyone at kindergarten, elementary school, high school, even in my 5 years of college.

I was in a soccer team from 5 to 15 years old with the same guys, during practice I was always training with the coach no one wanted to be with me.

Some years ago i went to a psychologist, she said she could not help me, she didn't know how i could live like that, that i was too mysterious for her (i don't even know what this mean). She refused that i pay for the session.

I still live with my parents, fuck this is so pathetic. My house I am building will be finished in about 3 months (thanks god). It was not worth it to stay with my parents that long to get my own house that will worth near 500k.

I never tried dating apps because i am not able to see myself in a fucking picture, i'm a skinny guy that still look like 20 years old with no beard. I am trying to gain weight, i was 127lb 1.5 year ago now i am 142lb but i don't see any differences (im 5""11)

depression,2020/03/26,"How Can I (depressed 22F) Help My Husband (not depressed 22M) with my Depression? Hi everyone, as you can read from the title, I'm seeking help on how to help my husband with my depression.

A bit of backstory: I've struggled with mild-moderate depression and some anxiety since I was 15 and I have somewhat unhealthy ways of coping with it, but I'm still here, so they work, I guess? Before my husband, I've never had any true long term relationships, but you can probably tell that from my age haha. I consider myself extremely lucky to have found my soulmate, and that's why I'm writing this post.

Before my husband, I usually dealt with my spirals, breakdowns, and panic attacks alone, in my room, isolated from the world. Like I said, the mechanisms are somewhat unhealthy, but it's because I don't want to subject anyone to the toxicity I carry during my lows. I don't want to go into more details just in case they might be triggering.

Now that I'm with him, it's really hard to go through the same mechanisms. I would spiral, and it would bubble underneath me for hours, and I would be absolutely destroyed by my own brain, and my husband would be there to pick up the pieces. He's always been there for me during these times.

I love and care about him so much, so it physically and mentally hurt me so much more when I'm going through my lows. I learned that I have a terrible tendency to push him away, using excuses each more intricate than the last. I started to get these strong urges and impulses to hurt myself or behave violently when things don't feel resolved, and that's a huge part of my fear, that I'll end up dead. 

This hurts him as much as it hurts me, and I'm afraid of what might happen one day if I don't learn how to help him help me. What should I do to help my husband with my depression?

TL;DR: I (22F) want to help my husband (22M) better ways to cope with and handle my depression."

\*I post it here in the depression community because we all deserve to get out of the mind, emotion delusions the we have drown ourselves into and allocated tremendous amounts of energy and thought but where there is no escape except cycles of misery. We share a new perspective here and I encourage you to explore the ideas in the book. While people are mostly concerned about solutions to depression, we here, together question the very existence of depression. Is it perceived, invented ? or natural and then what is natural anyway ? Natural is cultural programming we are conditioned to. (Imposition of a concept to sensory inputs(for e.g daily experiences))

depression,2020/03/27,"My family is falling apart during quarantine. My family’s relationship has always been rocky but generally we just back off and calm down. Ever since quarantine started, we have all been fighting and picking on each other non stop and its miserable. 

My dad keeps leaving at night to “go do his own thing” which he has been doing for years and no body knows what “his own thing is”. I (17M) am constantly fighting with my extremely annoying sister (14F), which my parents are yelling at us for, all while my parents are also yelling at each other because my dad is never around (but is around more than usual on quarantine) and never does anything for the family and my mom hates him for it.

What do I do? I am having a terrible time and I just want this whole thing to be over. I am about ready to tell my dad to “get the fuck out of our house” because he is pissing me off more than normal as well."
depression,2020/03/27,"I don't know what to think about myself Ok, major question here: could I possibly be depressed? Or smth else?

My story short version (sorry. I wrote too much and is not a short version anymore! Also, sorry for my non-native english).

This is the first time ever I talk about my problems with anyone.

I'm a 27M who recently (6 months ago) moved out from parents home to live with a close friend.

I work as IT support in a office I truly hate. That's why I applied for another work for government, which is a completely different work and I think it will be a nice new start for me.

I'm single, I had one serious relation which finished around 8 years ago and I was never been capable to find another girl, until I knew on Tinder a very nice girl one month ago, which seemed perfect for me. (just tbh, I don't think I'm super ugly or stuff, I don't like myself but I think I'm a ""normal"" guy).

I'm not antisocial, I like to stay with other ppl and friends, but I usually can't go out because I don't have many friends and during weekends they usually go out with gf or stay at home. And I don't know how to make new friends.

I travel. A lot. These past years it was with my young brother. My travels are the only moments during the year when I'm truly happy and capable to see the bright side of life. That's why I usually do at least 3 ""big travels"" every year (and that's why I'm always out of money).

It seemed things was going better until Coronavirus, which completely paralyze my apply for the new job and for new travels. Also that girl I knew told me she is now looking exclusively at casual sex and random relationships with multiple ppl. Which is something I'm not sure I want... otherwise my choice is returning alone, again. So for now I'm still talking with her and waiting the end of the isolation, to see what will happen with her.

This is my story. It could seem like I'm a ""normal guy with an unlucky year"". But I often feel empty. Alone. When I come back to home, I usually stay in my bed, watching TV series and playing videogames.

I don't want to kill myself, mostly because my family would be devastated. And because I know that's completely useless. And I'm sort of ""depressed optimistic"": I know there are a solution for my feelings and I know I will found it at some point, but I feel tired to search it and sometimes I just want to sleep and wait the end of the day.

This aren't my feelings 24/7, sometimes I'm happy or whatever, but I'm also very lunatic and I change emotions in no time during a single day (The Office ""parkour"" meme related!).

(That feelings I explained happened also before the ""coronavirus case"", so that's completely unrelated, in case you thought it).

Any advice will be truly appreciated. I don't know if there's something I can do to move away from this situation and it seems everytime I try to do something, things go terribly wrong (like it was with the new girl and the new job).

If you read until here, thanks."
depression,2020/03/27,"Four times I’ve tried dating my girlfriend, three times haven’t worked. I’m certain the fourth is about to end. Why do I try anymore? My girlfriend(17) and I(19M) have been on and off for about six years. This is the fourth time we’ve dated; it hasn’t even been three months and she’s already wanting to call it quits. I feel like it’s all my fault that I haven’t been able to do what I’m supposed to do. I have no way to see other than get rides to her house or see her at work (or vice versa), we’ve only seen each other a handful of times within the past year (it feels like it’s worth it every time I get to see her, I truly do love her and seeing makes my world just a little brighter), and she’s been stressed at home for reasons I won’t explain. I felt that this was coming sometime soon because she hadn’t been responsive (most likely because of how clingy I tend to get) for a couple weeks, but with the whole Coronavirus issue coming into play, she has to work her butt off to provide enough income for her family (she makes the most money and works at Walmart for around $11/hour). I’m hoping it’s just the stress getting to her, but at this point I’ve just given up. She’s like one of the only reasons I want to live my life to the fullest left. I don’t want her to go away, but I want the best for her. I’m giving up on everything. I don’t know what to do anymore..."
depression,2020/03/27,"Evaluate My Message To My Depressed Bf my (18F) long-distance bf (19M) has been very withdrawn recently. i’m aware he has been dealing with his mental health for a long while, but within the year and a half we’ve been dating, this is the very first time i’m experiencing his depressive episodes to this extent.

this has been going on since mid january when his feelings of self-doubt and worthlessness became especially prevalent to me. he has opened up to me about how he feels and he has explained his thought process to me. since then until now, he can often go multiple days without responding back to me because of stress or lack of energy or just general apathy, which i understand. however, i’m guilty of becoming anxious and constantly wondering if i play a part in his sadness (though he has reassured me i don’t) - i’m trying my best to steer away from that mentality.

he hasn’t responded in 4 days so i was planning to send him a handwritten message (thought it’ll be scanned and sent as an image). please let me know if there’s anything else i can add to further emphasise the support and love i have for him and if what i’m saying is helpful and reassuring at all.

——————————————————————

i’m sorry i can’t do more for you my love. and i’m sorry if i may get upset at times, but please don’t interpret it as you not being good enough. you’re more than enough for me - you always have been. it hurts to know that you may be struggling so much more than i’m aware of and that i can’t comfort you in ways other than words. i know it may not feel like it but i believe you have the strength in you to hold yourself above this. i’m praying for you everyday and i’m trying my best to understand you in the most helpful way possible. i apologise if i’ve ever overwhelmed you, made you feel guilty or made you feel like a burden. i value you, you’re important to me and i care so much about you. there’s nothing i want more than for you to not have to endure so much pain anymore. please take care of yourself in the meantime and stay safe. take your time and don’t force yourself - i’ll always be here whenever you need me to be; whenever you’re ready. i’ve never stopped being proud of you and proud to have you. you’re my blessing. please don’t forget that i love you with everything that i have my darling.

depression,2020/03/28,"Im (27M) struggling with my mom's controlling behavior and her distrust. I'm 27 years old unemployed university graduate, staying with my parents after I resigned from old workplace.

I love my mom, but I already had enough with her controlling behavior. A little example; she assumed me playing games while I'm struggling to working on my curriculum vitae as I'm trying to find some jobs online. 

Today, she hold me off to going workout at dawn because she called inappropriate to doing anything before prayer's call. I know the current situation involving COVID-19, but I know what I'm doing. 

I already planned that I will run around my house only for 10 minutes; 1.5 km run. I did that because her concern, I ran at dawn because no one crossing on the road at that time knowing after she thought COVID-19 brought from dust and fog from commuting vehicles.

I'm struggling with this classic parent-children thing but this is ridiculous, even in my position as the last child.

I can't hold these negative emotions sometimes I burst out and yelling at my mom because I can't take it anymore. I don't know how to stand up for myself in front of my parents properly. It's affecting my mental health and stress management sometimes I punched wall to calm myself.

depression,2020/03/28,"What is it like to be depressed? I (17M) have been feeling like I'm depressed for the past year and a half. I can't really go to a medical professional without telling my parents and I don't want them to freak out. The thing is, that I'm not sure if I'm depressed or just plain sad and so I was hoping somebody here would help me diagnose myself as to whether I do in fact have depression or not.

A couple reasons as to why I'm not sure whether I am in fact depressed are -

1) It is genuinely better some days. I am sad most of the time, but not all the time. It has gotten worse in the last week or so where I don't feel like doing anything I previously enjoyed but it has only been since my break up so this will probably pass.

2) Apart from my recent break up, there hasn't really been any major incident in my life which would make me depressed. And even my break up is a very small thing considering what other people here have gone through. So I feel like there isn't really any reason for me to feel depressed. It's just sadness but as I have mentioned before, it has been a year and a half and it doesn't seem to be getting better.

To everybody who is going through something right now, I wish you the very best and hope you feel better soon :)"

I love her but I haven’t been able to sleep for longer than 2-3 hours at a time since she told me because I keep thinking about her and that guy. If she plans on having my child I can’t leave her, I have to be a good father.

depression,2020/03/30,"Back home because of COVID-19, I (25F) have noticed clear signs of depression in my ageing immigrant father (53M) and it's breaking my heart for not knowing how to help. My father immigrated to Canada back in the 70s, got lucky. With a 70K figure salary, his charm, and active social life, he was a happy clam with my mother. This all changed slowly when he quit drinking and lost the social group he nurtured since his 20s. He also lost his job in the 2008 crash and has since needed to resort to cab and truck driving because he never completed high school, and no longer was the breadwinner at home as my mother surpassed his income in a clerical finance role.

As an adult, he also cannot fill his afternoons or days with helping me or anyone in our family as all siblings are self-sufficient. During this strange virus, I have moved home to be with my family having formerly lived 3 time zones away. While the entire family (siblings and mother) resort to our rooms to work during the office hours of our respected jobs (PST/EST/MST), we limit our social time to lunch and dinner after logging off from the day. My father, however, has been out of work. The cab business is slow, and that resorts to him being at home. Without former hobbies or interests, he often spends unhealthy hours watching videos in English that he often does not understand. He has fortunately found interest in recipes and daring to cook, but it is all time spent alone. He does not seem to have friends he can socialize with, and will often walk, or nap throughout the day, curled up in a ball on the couch or bed. If he hears footsteps, he'll sit up or ask if he can help with anything.

I don't know how to help my father who appears to lost all zest for life. He is not needed and does not know how to spend his days if not working. He also grew up in a different generation where I imagine it hurts to not be the provider of the family and instead has become the house dad to no children.

I love my father dearly, and while I understand his situation may be unique, I just don't know how to help. I'm sorry if I didn't provide the correct details here, and I do appreciate any advice on how to strengthen my relationship with him or him with others.

TLDR; Immigrant father is visibly depressed, and I am now noticing clear signs while at home b/c of COVID-19. Unsure how to navigate this situation as he is very reserved and is attempting to fake being ""okay"" when others are around."
depression,2020/03/30,"A constant string of negativity Hello, this would be my first post on this website. I'm sorry if I made any mistakes that seems to go under my eye (including grammar).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm Ken, 19M from the PH. Since the first day of lockdown here in our country, I thought it would be great for an ambivert? like me to stay at home and continue my daily life as a streamer. The reason why I put on ""?"" on ambivert is that I can't understand myself if I'm an introvert or an extrovert at this point. Getting back on the topic, I thought I would have a blast. It's already the 3rd week of the lockdown, my mind can't calm itself and my wild imagination spreads out of the brain. Not mentioning the time of the sleep (3am till' 8am) then play games all night long. Tonight,  I was trying to think of something that might help me reduce my ""stress"". I can't even play games, masturbate, stream, watch videos, etc. I am constantly having the same thing that goes on my mind. ""I am useless"". I always think of this not only when the pandemic started, ever since my last breakup, I was constantly blaming myself for being the useless side of a relationship. I never noticed this kind of thing. It only got into me as I type this down.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if I managed to fuck this up, be an asshole about it, be a fucking cry baby or anything that come into your mind if ever you read the whole bullshit that came from my depressive self, I just needed to tell someone regardless if they care or not. I just wanted to avoid being a suicidal for nothing useful of a teenager.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is all just getting into my head. If ever you have some advice or some critique about my bullshit situation, please do tell me because I would really appreciate it right now. Thank you.

Recently I've been able to make myself feel like I have some kind of purpose (ie: getting work, better grades in college) but now that we're all in quarantine, I don't know what's meaningful to me anymore.

There were stages in my life where I was unhappy and felt like a cloud was over my head. This lasted for years and then I hit a turning point and started figuring things out and improved my overall happiness.  
A few years ago I started learning about positive psychology to continue to learn systems to help me live with as much joy as possible. I continued to read books and become a certified coach along the way.  


During this time of uncertainty and being stuck in the damn house all the time, I see myself having similar feelings… but it’s totally different now as I’m able to recover from negative feelings much quicker and not get caught up in them.

depression,2020/04/02,"I (18F) need advice on how to help my boyfriend (18M) get through his depression. I myself am a sufferer of mental health issues, though I feel as though I cope as best I can. I remind myself of how lucky I am, whilst also not dismissing how I feel. I take necessary days off to in the long term aid my mental health. I have routines and resources to look forward to , I also have outlets to vent to in times of despair. I’ve dealt with depression long enough to over come it for the most part whilst still suffering . My brother attempted suicide when I was 12, and from that point onwards it was the beginning of my mental health issues. Though going through that, I know suicide is an option I will never consider, whilst even feeling suicidal. The lasting damage is too painful on those you love and I’ve learned how precious life is through this. In conclusion, I’ve come to terms with my depression being apart of me, and I’ve tried my best to adapt.
I’m glad I’m growing up in a period of time where mental health for the most part is normalised, if not I don’t think I would cope as-well as I do. Though my boyfriend on the other hand, struggles to see the light, and struggles to get through the day with his underlying depressive thoughts. These depressive thoughts have become darker. He doesn’t put the pressure of suicide on our relationship, though he has made it clear he has suicidal thoughts, and finds it hard to see past these thoughts. With everything going on right now and for him to not have his usual resources of happiness that help him through the day, he is getting worse. Also me not being there in person to comfort him is hurting him a lot. I feel myself getting overwhelmed by everything also but I’m still coping and believe this is temporary and it will all be okay. If I didn’t think this way I also would be cracking up alike him. But he can’t seem to take on this ‘it will be okay’ mindset, which is important right now. But it would be ignorant of me to get annoyed that he doesn’t think this way, because that’s an element of depression which he has, negative thoughts and feelings of despair.
I have voiced that I think he needs professional help, as have his friends( he got the courage to openly discuss his mental health to his friends, and have they also in return). He’s aware it isn’t fair to put this stress over us by opening up about how he feels(regarding his suicidal thoughts), though he can’t come to terms with getting to the point of talking to his parents. That would be the first step in getting towards professional help.
I can’t help put feel overwhelmed when the topic comes up. I don’t know how to react. I’m not a professional. My advice to him is to realise how he currently feels is only temporary, and that I myself go through bouts of depression. I get out of them. I’m okay for a while. I fall back. He has never experienced depression up until 2 years ago. I have experienced depression for the past 6 years. Hence, my reasoning for my development of coping mechanisms. He can’t come to terms with why he isn’t like his old self, why he isn’t happy all the time. We all have our breaking point I believe, when childhood happiness just fades. Though he often thinks back to when he didn’t feel this way. But I don’t know how to help that. 
With my experiences , and relatability to how he feels in ways, still doesn’t help. I never turn things on myself ,I simply resonate. I’m aware of how annoying it is when your upset and someone ignorantly makes it about them. I give advice as to how I deal . How I think he should approach things that will help him. But I can’t help him. I don’t know how to help him. But all I want to do, is to help and be there. I believe he is only going to get worse as this goes on, and I don’t know where else to go for advice. I myself will probably only worsen too, I feel we all will. But how do we keep sane in the midst of a pandemic? How can I help him keep sane and halt his worsening thoughts? I’m trying my best and advice is really what I need right now."
depression,2020/04/02,"How to get on with my life(15M) How do I get on with my life everyday. My whole life I've always been trying to help others,and this goes from the fact that I'm adopted, so I feel that my problems could always be worst, and I should just try to suck it up and help others fix there own issues. I always thought that since im adopted I should try to help others as a way to cope with it. I always knew me helping other would not solve my problem but I though I would have time to think about what I was going to do to get over my problems. Now with this coranavirus it just eating at me. I cant help anybody,so now I'm just stuck thinking about my own problems.

I would tell my parents but I don't want to put a burden on there life worrying about me. As far as i can tell they said I was being quite lately but i just told them in feeling a little sick. I feel that sense they already take care of me I should not tell them. I also don't feel like I should tell any other friend or family because it would just be a burden on them to. How do to I get over this these feeling of self worthlessness without my family getting involved."
depression,2020/04/03,"I just need to do the work (18M) I have 8 weeks left until exams and i haven't done any study. I know if i start now ill do well enough to get out of this house but I'm just struggling. I dropped out of  school a couple months ago because i was tired of being stuck in the same place. I had no friends and I was just awkward as hell. I left because I'd made the decision to improve my life and I felt there was no room for change in boarding school. 

I feel like my anxiety around other people has improved but I'm still always alone and its so hard to study when you're so divorced from reality. I'm now living at home (studying as an external candidate) and  trying to study to get some grades so I can leave this place(my home is in the middle of nowhere)   

But every day i can barely get out of bed. I have no hobbies and i dont get the work done. Ive tried to do things but its all so boring, ive just lost my patience from years of tv and i cant seem to handle something without instant gratification. I dont want to end up like one of those guys who stay home for their entire life. I don't like tv, i dont like anything but everyday the hours just slide by and i cant force myself to do the work. i get lost in these pathetic fantasies of fame and being liked but god its so boring. i dont even enjoy music and tv anymore.

The fantasy is so boring and so pathetic but its just marginally better than reality.

I worry about this post coming across as self pitying. I know what i need to do. In the last few months my social anxiety has improved and somehow i can now hold a normal conversation and seem like a normal person. I need to start a schedule and stick to it but i've done this several times. i'm sorry if it sounds defeatist but i'm tired of repeating the same mistakes day in day out with no progress with my life. I've moved on from being awkward around people but the damage is done and i'm alone and its hard to work when there nothing around to remind you what to work for. The last few months have been a waste but if i can beat these next 8 weeks i can get to a place where i don't have to be alone 

I know what i have to do to get on with my life. I don't know if its going to work, sorry but i just had let  all of this out."
depression,2020/04/03,"My (28F) BF (26M) of 5 years got caught cheating on me while I am here in the Children's Hospital with our 2yo daughter who's intubated and fighting a viral pneumonia. 
I've been so tired. So depressed.. 
Dealing with different doctors everyday, my daughter's developmentally delayed with a seizure disorder. So it was a little more difficult for her to fight off this common viral pneumonia kids her age tend to get. 

I've been in the hospital since March 2nd with our daughter who turned 2 on the March 21st. Everything was going okay so far, her dad was coming over every night after work and being all the great things (bc otherwise I'd be pissed at him for not being here for us, we've had this fight one too many times) but he stepped it up this time. I told him I was so happy and proud that we were doing okay and he was here for us. But then COVID-19 hit us and suddenly shit got really real for us. They kicked out my mom one week and limited to visitors to only mom and dad at bedside... A week later Dad got kicked out, now it's only me allowed at bedside. 

It's been super rough going through all of this alone to say the least. Then things really started to get emotionally draining for me. Her dad started being  irresponsible, pulling rent money from our savings to buy weed, smoking way too much, spending long amounts of hours on the game. He stopped texting me back, I would get upset because I needed him here for me still and wanted to talk to him. I don't have anyone to talk to. He's supposed to be my person. We fought over that for a few days. I didn't talk to him for two days. 

His Facebook was logged in on his laptop that was left here for me to watch TV on. I got curious. He was liking this one girl's post at 5:00 in the morning (more on that later) he also unblocked one of his exes. Apparently he felt compelled to check up on them and see how they're doing at 5AM instead of thinking about us and checking to see how we're doing over here. Which really sucked. 

I questioned him, I asked him why he unblocked her,  he just was curious and wanted to see how she's doing apparently... The girl who cheated on him with her best friend. I questioned him about the other girl, the one that he was liking her post. He said he had no idea who she was and it just popped up on his timeline. 

We eventually 'sort of' get over our fighting. But I wasn't over it honestly, I was just tired of fighting. Tired of having to dumb things down for him and explain why his behavior is inappropriate and why it was hurtful for him to be a certain ways towards me. Regardless of how irritated he is. Things seemed kind of steady and okay. He's texting me often, calling me once he's out of work, bringing me food everyday again, all the great things... Telling me how he can't wait for us to be home so he can hold us and his arms.. All the great things he should've been doing all along. 

Then I find out that he's been messaging the one girl that he denied knowing through Snapchat. He's been consistently talking to her, he met her through his coworker. He lied to me about knowing her. He was planning to meet up with her tomorrow to ""hang out and smoke""

After telling him all of this and I knew the truth about it all he admitted it to me finally. He didn't really seem apologetic, didn't apologize. Kept saying he doesn't know what to say or how to fix it. He also said that he's not displaying any sympathy because he's ""half awake and super sleepy""

 I feel so shitty. 
I've been crying non-stop. I wanted to stay with him despite all of this to work this out for the sake of our daughter. He says he wants us to be a family and won't talk to her anymore, but I don't trust him. I'm already going crazy thinking about what he's going to do tomorrow and if he's going to lie to me and still hang out with her. It's already over. 

Hopefully we'll be getting discharged within the next week or so, and I have no idea where we're going to go. I don't want to go home to our apartment that's not a home anymore. My daughter is special needs and I haven't been able to work after graduating school because she doesn't qualify for nursing (something she needs) and there's not a daycare available that can watch her. My mom is not willing to help out much as far as daycare goes either. 

I don't know what the heck I'm going to do, but I do know that I can't go back to him after this."
depression,2020/04/03,"I (19M) resent every fucking breath I take What the fuck is wrong with me? I had the oppertune moment to take control of my life and I fucked it up. god Damn! if was going to be thrown in this fucking hell hole, at least give me some fucking backbone to deal with it.

depression,2020/04/04,"Depression morphing into rage Lately I've been feeling my depressive thoughts moving further towards an overwhelming sense of frustration. Lying around doing nothing is now being accompanied by temper tantrums and meltdowns. The depression makes me so goddamn mad and then the anger just funnels back into a deeper depression once I've calmed down. 

It's weird, I never thought of myself as having an anger problem. My parents and teachers were always concerned that I never seemed to show enough emotion. But now when I'm outside I've been punching holes in walls, breaking things and getting into fights. I feel myself getting more exasperated by the day, at my depression, at this state of being, my life, everything. I can feel it right now, Let me just type it IDASHSDFJK ,YLNV318O452B798165V9B \[384-K,09C 9\[821J-8FC9MT19234C,L=894,C2\`0

depression,2020/04/05,"I feel helpless at this point Hello fellow Redditors!  I'm 19M from India. It's 4.05am right now at the exact moment when I'm writing this post. Reddit right now is my last resort and I don't know where else to go as I feel mentally clutched and no one else to talk to right now. I have been experiencing spells of anxiety and depression ever since I was around 15 or 16 and it worsened day by day. It is also important to note that I have an extreme social awkwardness and even though I manage to make friends, they tend to keep me sidelined and hence I'm always left alone. I believed till then that maybe it's a part and parcel of my life, the loneliness. I have experienced bullying during my schooling days and I never realised how deeply it would scar me. I apologise if I'm not making any sense but it is during this point of the day that I feel most vulnerable and even during broad daylight, I literally have no one else to reach out to. If I go on speaking about my life here, it is going to be a huge rant and I don't wanna do that right now. I'm just here to vent the feeling about being lonely and facing severe panic attacks all throughout the day and feel isolated , gloomy and sleepless at night. I have lost interest in things I liked to do and instead I go about finding solace or solution over the internet. I don't know what is happening to me, I don't know what to do  and I feel it's better to die than be a burden to this many lot of people. 

Thank you for reading, i mean if you did. Also, sorry for posting this messed up thought, I could have texted this to someone instead but seeing there's no one, I ended up in this subreddit. Hope you all have a nice day."
depression,2020/04/05,"Feel in a constant downward spiral Alright, time to get this off my chest

23M, and due to the current epidemic my work shut down. I'm lucky that I'm financially comfortable and I know a lot of people have it worse than me but Idk. All I can do is stay in my apartment all day apart from going to the grocery store and stuff.

Not to mention the strain being apart is putting on my relationship with my SO, but that's a whole other story. I basically stay home and watch Amazon Prime and old Michael Jackson concerts most the day while having cigarette after cigarette. I never thought it'd be like this, I love to work. Nothing is going right. I give up.

Anyways, that's all I need to say. Just wanted to vent"
depression,2020/04/05,"why do I feel so lost all the time ? Some background : 23F, studying mechanical engineering, passed all my exams since the day I started college. In a 3-year relationship with a 28M, also engineer. But something just doesn't feel right. I feel ""broken"", as if a part of me was just cut off of me and thrown away and I can't find it back. In December, I just couldn't stop crying, all the time. He would come back from work to me, crying in despair. Something just hurt, still hurts but less and I don't know what it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel lost, all the time. Am I doing what's best for me ? Is being an engineer what I really want to purse for the years to come ?  Am I just depressed ? What's my purpose in life ? I just don't know what to think anymore and it just hurts all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like packing all my stuff and leaving for another country. But is it really going to change how I feel inside ? Is it just a dumb way to cope with my anxiety over my life ? I just wish someone who'd tell me that it's going to be okay in the end, that I'll eventually find my path, I'll find a purpose ...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just crying over this, not knowing what to do to change my mindset. Should I seek help ? Should I just wait as this feeling could magically go away ?

depression,2020/04/05,"Is it normal to want to break up with my girlfriend because I feel like a loser? What should I[20M] do? There are days when I cry because I hate myself and see myself as a horrible loser. I feel like I haven't achieved anything that I ever wanted and the path that I am going down, graduating and preparing for phd admission, isn't something I want to do. It's just family pressure. Nevermind all these things. The main problem is I love my girlfriend[21F] and I can only see a bad future for her if she remains with me. On my bad days, I feel like I should break up with her to give her a better life, although she is one of the few reasons I have still been able to keep myself from breaking down.

I'm losing so much over this and I've felt I have finally gotten over my depression after almost 8 years and yet, it feels like it's back and I'm off my meds now. I dont know what to do anymore, I relied on my medication, then I relied on people and gave up on meds. Now I have no one, no one to help me, no medicine to keep my emotions calm, I dont know what to do. My head is hurting and I can never sleep, my heart hurts and every breath is another breath I dont want to take. My life is hurting me every year. Every year I must suffer, I took years of countless bullying and lies and hate put towards me in highschool, middle shcool my friends betrayed me, and college, I thought would be a fresh start, but this is where I have been more suicidal than ever... Why is it back...I have a girlfriend now, I have a good family, nobody picks on me anymore...Why is this happening again, I cant take it, I want to end it, and put myself out of my misery. My life is pain and I've always hid it. Everyone got surprised seeing my medication back then thinking I was the happiest person in the world so they thought I didn't have issues. But it was a facade, and I realized I've fallen for my own facade, am I still depressed? Why??? I miss my medication, I miss my friends, I miss wanting to be alive...What is the point anymore, my life hurts so much, I can't take it, I can't even see my therapist or anything, Help me please... Why is this back...I want to be happy again desperately. I'm desperate...I dont want to end my life....and its not that I'm afraid of death, but I am afraid of the people I would leave behind...I cant do that to them....IVe always been told to just be happy, how....How do you be happy..."

The answer would be that their are pure and absolute evil, sadistic, and conscious forces who fuck up the lives of good people who deserve better for their sadistic pleasure and entertainment and control our lives, events around us, our thoughts, emotions, and actions to make us suffer for no reason. we live in the Matrix and that live is an insufferable and inescapable hell that is being controlled by evil forces outside the universe that are secretly , unknowingly, and psychologically tormenting and torture us for no reason and do it in really well and hidden ways and affect the external factors around us that makes us repeat our wrong habits and the unnecessarily bad things that repeatedly happen in our lives that are not in our control or responsibility and speed up time so uncomfortably fast to make us miss the moment and feel forever trapped and miserable.

depression,2020/04/05,"I’m falling So I sit in bed daily and sleep. Sometimes I get up to eat, walk around or cook, but mostly I just lie in bed and fall in and out of sleep. 
My (19F) boyfriend (25M) is a really great help, but he is also going through depression and has constant, overwhelming anxiety. He really needs my support and I want to be there for him.
I grew up in a privileged family, and I know that. I am so grateful for the life I was given, but for some reason I feel this bitter coldness enveloping me more and more. I don’t want to go outside and do things, I don’t enjoy things like I used to. I just sleep. I’ve been seeking help from psychologists, psychiatrists and GP’s but I also feel like I’m not worth their time. As if my problems aren’t worth it. Maybe that’s why I sugar coat things and say that things aren’t that bad. That I’m coping okay. 
But really, I feel so close to doing something reckless. It feels like no one can see how close I am to drowning, but some part of me will smile and tell people I’m okay because I feel immense guilt from even suggesting that I’m not.
What’s wrong with me?"
depression,2020/04/06,"My father walked out on us today. For some context, I am 20M and usually live away from home for university reasons but am back home now due to lockdown in the UK.

Anyway, today was fucking awful. I woke up late, and something just felt off in the house. When I went down to get breakfast, I found a note from my father addressed to my mother explaining that he had betrayed her trust and didn't know how to tell her about it. Later, he came home and spoke to me. Turns out he had been seeing someone else, and that person wasn't even much older than me. He has decided to move out for a week, though he has said that this doesn't necessarily mean he and my mother are going to split up, but I think it will culminate in divorce.

Yet, the troubling thing was that when he told me, though he was crying and very clearly upset about the whole thing, I felt absolutely nothing. Not sadness, not despair, not even anger. I just felt absolutely void of anything at all.

Perhaps the emotions of the situation are yet to kick in, but I feel absolutely fucking nothing and I hate it. I feel like my own depression is preventing me from even being able to generate normal human emotions at this point. I want to fucking die."
depression,2020/04/06,"Debating whether to commit on April 20.  Hello, I am 16F. I am selectively mute which makes it nearly impossible to make friends. I did have one but she got more popular than me, changed into a different person and let her new friends bully me. I cut her out but she’s the most liked person at my school and turned everyone against me. This isn’t as big of a concern anymore since school is canceled, but I’m still so depressed. I had my first boyfriend 22M I met in an instagram community and we got very close. I realize the age difference was wrong but I was too caught up in it and thought I loved him. He added me to a discord chat with his friends and it was okay for a while. We exchanged pictures (i really only do this if i think i love someone) which I deeply regret. Then after 2-3 weeks one of his friends in the group chat was being mean so he called her out on it and she got really mad. She posted on her instagram story about our age gap and had all her friends send him mean messages. We broke up which was really upsetting. Then just a few days ago I met someone on here I really liked and I got too excited and we exchanged pictures quickly. I liked him a lot but he’s also suffering with depression and told me he’s blocking everyone so he’ll be able to kill himself tonight. I am devastated and angry with everything. And it’s not only stupid high school drama, I absolutely cannot connect with anyone. I cannot make friends, I am always a second choice. And I have since left that instagram community where all my online friends were so i have no one to talk to. I’m so angered with how cruel and thoughtless people are. And if you look at my profile you’ll see I post in r/selfie often, I am aware that I can be attractive sometimes. I post those pictures to get attention from men that I don’t get irl. I promise I look completely different in person. My skin is covered in acne, I have greasy hair and my bangs are too short, I feel fat all the time, I dress weird.  I get bullied at school. I don’t care how pretty I look to weird men that message me. I hate everything and everyone around me and when I’m not suicidal I’m homicidal. I am currently on 20mg of Prozac and went to the Psych Ward a few weeks ago but am still extremely depressed. I’m failing online school. I know how to slit my wrists but I’m afraid. How many mg of Prozac will kill me?"
depression,2020/04/06,"(30M) I'm ugly and depressed I suck at socializing, having no friends let alone girlfriend, I never had one. I have very asymmetrical face structure and pretty long chin.

depression,2020/04/06,"Divorce because of depression? I'm (26F) not sure how to word this. I've had depression for a few years,  diagnosed about 3 years ago. I was on a few different kinds of meds and it kind of worked for the most part. It did, however, mellow me out completely. No bad lows, but no great highs anymore either. My husband (33M) expressed his concern with my emotional flatness (and zero sex drive) and I got off the meds This was maybe 6 months ago. I also changed birth control methods and then got off those completely too, about 3.5 months ago in an effort to be myself again. My depression has crept back up over the last couple of months and my sex drive is still zero. I've been taking addyi for almost a month now with no results, but I know it can take up to 8 weeks so I'm hopeful. 


Anyway. I've had good days and bad days lately. On the bad days I emote less and just sit around, basically. Nothing terrible. Just not ideal. My husband just came to me with his concerns again that I am not pleasant enough around him and I need to fake it till I make it--not his exact words but that was the sentiment. I don't really know what to tell him. I said it's a process and I'm doing my best and he pointed out that when he met me 6 years ago I was not like this. He's right, I wasn't depressed then. He was very clear that he does not want me to force myself to have sex with him, so that's not the issue. The issue is I feel like he's ready to divorce me because I'm depressed and I literally do not know what to do. I can't help this. He's a control freak and he's trying to control my emotions I guess? I just don't know if this will get better or what I can do, other than getting back on an antidepressant. Any advice is welcome."

My prom date who I had a crush on for years made out with another dude in front of me and ran off to F**k him in his car and because she was from out of town she stayed over my place and the next morning after she invited him over so she can make out with him and in his car on my driveway amd people found out and I got humiliated all the way to graduation

SARA: 
The girl i had feelings for in high school but who friendzoned me is getting married  to a guy who is cheated on her with a teacher She started dating him when me and her were seniors and he was a freshman. Hes an absolute scumbag. I truly hate him. He was caught sexting a teacher caught on the news and has been caught texting other girls with intent to cheat multiple times. and now the girl I want is marrying him and **A TEACHER HERSELF**
She would use me as the shoulder to cry on and then when she was done crying to me she would have me go away and then she would go back to him after I'm not saying it wasn't my own fault but to some degree I was used emotionally

and now everybody is happy that they're getting married it's like I'm living in the Twilight Zone that people forget that he cheated on her with the teacher and got caught on the news. 
Then five years ago when my mom passed away everybody I knew gave me their condolences even people I didn't like but they still were decent enough to tell me their condolences **EXCEPT HER** She didn't even give me a my condolences at the minimum despite her feeding me lies saying how me and her were such close good friends.  She couldn't even text me ""My condolences"" or ""Sorry for your loss"" not even 2 to 4 words in a text. I go to therapy **BECAUSE** of this experience. 

I then messaged her saying how it hurt me that she didn't say anything I told her how I felt about her I told her that her boyfriend now fiance is a scumbag I told her she's dumb for staying with a scumbag like that and the last thing she ever told me was
""F**k you loser sorry you're so mad at the world"" 

**THE WEEK MY MOM DIED!!!**

 last thing I ever said to her was ""how is that possible? I'm not a scumbag who cheats on you. Isn't that what you prefer to f**k?"" That was five years ago and we haven't spoken since. The wedding was in July

All my life women I've liked rejected me or ignored me. The only time women liked me they were morbidly obese and extremely unattractive but then I would be told to ""give them a chance that's your league anyways at least they're nice girls"" 😒 being told to take an L with a smile isn't a great life. Especially if you compare her to the women who rejected me. Their husbands and boyfriends (WHO I LOATHE) see that I'm with a woman much less unattractive after being rejected by them gives them a whole lot of leverage over me and that's absolutely humiliating for me like ""Haha my girl rejected you and you're stuck with an ugly woman. sucks to suck loser"". That is HUMILIATION defined, and everybody wants me to embrace this happening and it's NOT FAIR.

I'll be happy when a woman hotter than the women who rejected me loves me. Until then, ALL I EVER GOT WAS FUCKED OVER NO LUBE OR SPIT AND THEN PEOPLE TELL ME BE HAPPY FOR THE PEOPLE I HATE. TO JUST LIE DOWN AND TAKE IT AND THATS FUCKING BULLSHIT"
depression,2020/04/09,"The lockdown has reversed any progress I made and I feel at my worst once again. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. Having struggled for years with depression, anxiety, and addiction (am 20M) this 6 months I’ve finally managed to get things somewhat on track.

I have an amazing girlfriend, the nicest, sweetest person you could possibly ask for. I haven’t seen her in a month and it’s killing me. My medication regimen seems to be somewhat effective - Elvanse, Bupropion, Naltrexone and the key winner Agomelatine.

I restarted university on a new course I like. I was doing much better. Clean for 7 months. Anxiety a little reduced but nowhere near as depressed and stopped being suicidal.
Now suddenly this all happens. U.K. in lockdown. I’m trapped at home with my family. I’ve lost weight, I feel like nauseous, every minute lasts an hour. My mood tracker went from consistent meh/good to lowest of the low. There’s no consideration for people struggling with mental health through this. It can’t be fixed whilst I’m stuck here - there’s no use trying to exercise, talk to family, meditate, “distract myself” or whatever. I tried this stuff and it doesn’t work or I have no motivation.

I’m truly miserable once again and I’m fed up to the point where I just don’t see a reason to keep going. I don’t know what to do, I just want to go to sleep and wake up when this is all over, or just not wake up at all."
depression,2020/04/10,"Depression that removes all physical pleasure, physically numb? Hey I’m a [23M], and I’ve experienced some drastic changes in physical pleasure since winter. It all started with me getting some relapses with my anxiety, and ever since that my skin has completely refused to accept physical stimuli. Massages don’t feel good anymore, masturbation don’t feel good anymore, and if I’m itching myself not even THAT feels good anymore. Has anyone experienced anything like this, physical numbness to anything that’s supposed to feel good? 

I also feel like I can yawn and be tired, but I never wake up well rested. And I can be tired for one second, then I’m not tired anymore the other second.."
depression,2020/04/10,"Finally spoke to my parents about my depression I (20M) have been living with depression for the better part of a year now. I was always afraid to tell my parents because they worry too much, and I didn't want them neglecting their own health over mine.

However, the circumstances over the past few days, added with the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent quarantine has broken me like no other, and I finally opened up to my parents about my feelings.

They told me to ""stop being a baby"" and to just ""snap out of it"".

What do I do now? I have never felt so lost in my life. And this is coming from a person who hasn't had a proper social interaction in more than a year. 

Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you."
depression,2020/04/10,"Feeling inferior to sibling I (24F) have always felt inferior to my brother (28M) and it’s causing me to feel depressed when he is around. 

Growing up, my brother and I didn’t get along and he was so mean to me that now he is trying to mend his relations with me, however I still feel uncomfortable around him and then with everything else I’m about to say.. it’s definitely hard for me to feel happy. 

I have always been more introverted, where he has always had tons of friends and was athletic and did well in school without having to try. Now he is running marathons in other countries, has a great job and a serious girlfriend that my parents love (when my parents never show that same love to my SO). He also has done a program through Harvard and has been so successful while I’m struggling to find a job. 

I know it sounds lame to feel so depressed and inferior, but I just want to cry and isolate when he is around with my family. I feel as if my parents don’t see me as amazing as he is."
depression,2020/04/11,"Unable to get help because of nobody but myself I'm 18M and I'm currently home from college due to the whole corona thing. I've been unhappy here and there for a really long time but ive been seriously depressed for about a year now. It started as a simple thing and just kinda grew because I internalized everything and never got much off my chest. The people who know that I'm depressed never had a clue because I never let too much of it show, although I've been pushed over my limit a few times recently. 

When my problems first started, it was entirely a loneliness thing and I think at the time getting into a decent relationship might have helped but as I said it's grown into a much more general problem. I've swung up and down a lot but recently the lows have gotten lower and lower. A few months ago, something pushed me to cut myself and i did it quite a bit for about a month. Thankfully I managed to lift myself out of that, and overall my mood was improving due to some various things looking up for me. However, corona totally stalled all of that by closing off college. Since then I've started to plummet again. 

Things got bad enough that I decided I should get some help and I opened up slightly to my mom about my issues. This is where I struggle. I can barely talk to people about this stuff, even just saying I'm depressed without going into the details is hard for me. She still doesn't know how awful it's gotten over the last few months because I'm incapable of telling her even when the opportunities show themselves. Because of this, she's reacted to me like I don't have any real problems, it's just hormones, etc (you guys know the drill). She did agree to try and help me talk to a therapist but her idea was kinda skewed as to what that would look like. She thinks the therapist would explain to me what real problems are, I'd see how miniscule my own are, and then we'd all be happy go lucky and I'd get over my stuff. Of course, that's bs but I don't have the strength to tell her that.

Today she got really mad at me and basically nailed me with the stuff everyone fears hearing from a parent. She's disappointed in me, she said I'm weak and I need to toughen up so I can get over my little problems that apparently can't compare to what she's faced in her life. I couldn't say anything while she was yelling at me and then she left. There was so much stuff going through my head and it was too much and my brain went to what it saw as the only logical solution: cutting myself. So yeah, I've been off cutting for like two months and I just did it again because I don't have the balls to open up about the reality of my condition. I'm just a dogshit person who runs away from every problem in my life and internalizes everything negative. I've been in that state of suicidal thinking where you really want to but you're too scared to do it for a while, but I'm getting less and less scared of the idea as the days go on. I just have no clue what the hell I can do in this situation. 

Sorry for the long rant but I've never talked about this stuff to anyone before so there was a lot to get off my chest."
depression,2020/04/11,20M new guy from india here. It's literally my first reddit post(not entirely sure how this works) It's been 14-15 months since I was diagnosed with depression. Also been told I have BPD. Also I'm suicidal even when  I'm not depressed. Meds and psychotherapy have had not stopped me from trying to kill myself. I dropped out of college and most of my friends have cut ties with me. I'm trying to find help here cause I don't I have anything to lose.
depression,2020/04/12,"I started to have episodes of depression or something, im worried I'M 15M if it mattrrs. So it started on september, i had episoeds every three weeks or so, and in those episodes i just don't care about anything and im sad for no reason and thinking i will not achieve anything and my lonliness is increased and i picture my future and it is just me, numb and sad, with no friends or people to  talk to, waking up, going to a work i don't need to talk to anyone and go home, and do nothing. In those episodes i just kinda assume i will kill myself one day, so i feel guilty about anything my parents invest do for me.
Those episodes became more and more frequant to the point of once or twice a week. The wierd thing is, that when i go to sleep and i wake up like nothing happenned until the next episode, and i try not to fall to an episode, but i don't care to much. I fear that one day i will go to sleep, wake up, and steel be sad. I'm not gonna tell anyone about these episodes.
My question is, is that a normal thing that happens to teenager or i should be worried?

Sorry about misspelling and stuff"

depression,2020/04/12,"Help with conversations Hey there everyone, I’m a 19M and I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me with convos. This has been a problem for me since I was 14. It has severely affected my social and love life. I find it difficult to make friends and I’ve never really found a girl that finds me interesting. I’ve tried asking some of my friends to help but everything they tell me to text/say makes me feel like I’m lying because I’m not smooth or that interesting. I would like to thank anyone I’m advance for the help."
depression,2020/04/14,"My girlfriend needs help. Hey everybody. I’m (22M) pretty much lost on how to help my girlfriend (20F). For the past 3 weeks or so she’s been suffering from what I would say is moderate to severe depression.

This past week was especially tough. She confided in me that she’s been sexually abused periodically over the past decade by a family friend, including one incident that happened the day before she told me all of this. She made me swear not to tell anybody or do anything (since I know the perpetrator’s name). I have since held that promise.

Now what’s even trickier is my girlfriend hardly has any family to confide in even if she wanted to. Her mother left at a young age. Her father who raised her and she still lives with, is a really great dad. But they never connected emotionally and she refused to tell him after I pleaded her too. Her reasoning was that she didn’t want to burden him and ruin the great life he’s provided for her.

So I’m really in a pickle. I love this girl to death. Yesterday was a better day. On her good days she can do things, but is slightly tired. Today is a bad day. She’ll stay in bed all day on her bad days. She also always texts me after I leave on her bad days and says I deserve better, and that she doesn’t wanna me to be hurt by her depression. It terrifies me but I believe this is the depression talking.

I’ve been researching a lot about depression and what I should and shouldn’t do. I’ve looked up local mental health clinics... as I believe she needs professional help. But everything is closed with the COVID-19. She‘ll probably refuse anyways, having told me before that depression medication never worked and neither did counselling. 

Reddit, please educate me. What should I do? I told her I’d support her no matter what."
depression,2020/04/14,"I’m losing patience with my mother. My (26M) mother (53F) is divorced these four years and is still grieving the end of her marriage. My mother is diagnosed with depression and she also has epilepsy. In the wake of her divorce, she leaned into her evangelical Christian upbringing and began to pray nightly vigils in her closet for my father (55M) to return to the family (mind you all, he is still in our lives and simply lives across town). My father was physically and psychologically abusive to her but she begs God to bring him back every day. She hangs her hopes in her “prodigal husband” returning on a... spiritual experience she had whilst in prayer at a church service: she claims to have heard the voice of God in her ears as clearly as I would speak to her, saying, “You’re praying the wrong prayer- (ex-husband’s name) must return to ME before he can return to you.”

Bear in mind that psychotic illness runs in her family, as does suicide. But she believes God spoke to her so she can never give up praying that my father will return. I’ve told her that the quality of our lives has improved since he left and my relationship with him has improved as well. Dad has grown as a man and, as unlikely as it should have been, has made amends for his abuse to my brother and me. He was criminally neglected and abused as a child and has come to terms with how it stunted his function as a model husband and father, but he will not re-marry my mother. My brother and I are grown and he will not again place himself in a circumstance that would tempt his abusive tendencies.

IANAD, but I am certain that the “voice of God” that my mother heard was a grief-induced hallucination *and a maladaptive one at that.* It has impeded her acceptance of the end of her marriage. She weeps on the sofa *every day these past four years* for Dad to return and that they can build the ideal, Christian family *that they never had in the first place.*

I’ve nearly lost all my patience for her daily grieving. She visits a... faith-based therapist monthly and refuses to see anyone else (the therapist is a quack and employs an [e-meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter?wprov=sfti1) in his sessions). Yes, I do live with her to monitor her epilepsy.

Any advice how to break this spell?

EDIT: If I’m grieving anything, I’m grieving my mother’s lost four years. I’ve met so many strong women from similar circumstances take voyages of self-discovery after divorce. They become stronger and more sure in their independent identities. They even become feminists! But my mother sinks lower and lower by the day, pining her lost role as a submissive wife. My dad has a girlfriend now and they live together and she has become spiteful, hateful. I just want to yell at her, “GET OVER IT! IT’S OVER!”"
depression,2020/04/15,"Feel hopeless more each day I [22M] wish I was never born into this shitty existence of a life. Not one day has gone by where I can throughly say I'm happy with my life. I'm in debt, banking on a degree that might get me no where, making 9 dollars an hour, I have no life outside of work. All my friends are over the internet. No one makes plans with me, no one stops by to see me, no one cares. Even if they did my life still sucks. I'm just genuinely at the point where everyday becomes more a struggle. I have to take medications to feel normal (have anxiety disorder/ PTSD) . Im constantly having mental breakdowns. I hate where I live but I have no way out. I can't afford to live somewhere on 9 bucks an hour. So I'm stuck here. In hell. I hate my life everyday and the idea that it's gonna get better somehow as if all my life's problems will be gone just isn't true. As time as went on in the past decade it's only gotten worse. My moms on the brink of death with her drinking addiction. My mental problems are through the roof. I feel so helpless. 

 I've been getting mental help for almost a decade now and it just feels like my depression can never go away. I'm so nervous that once I graduate college that job I want won't be there... Im going to college for my dream job. I've always wanted to be a journalist or something to do with writing, talking about sports whether it be a reporter, news station , just something with sports. The only things keeping me going is I know I'm pursuing my dream and what I love to do. But I'm so scared that once I do get my degree that job that I've always wanted won't be there and my degree in journalism and mass communications will be worthless :(. I don't want to be a failure"
depression,2020/04/15,"Why do I act out on social media? I (24M) have felt the urge to comment on things on social media to get a reaction out of someone, in hopes their reaction releases what’s clogged in my head. I’m not commenting anything mean, I just have the urge to comment on a lot of things. Like if someone posts something that may not make sense to me, I feel like I have to comment. A part of me thinks I’m doing it to prevent myself from going back into my depression. Maybe I don’t know how to let things go, maybe I have nothing going on in my life, maybe I’m just looking for someone to care. I really don’t know. And when I do comment I get anxious and get scared to open the app. But the relief after a sharp reaction from someone eases my brain. Like I can physically feel it. Feels like something has been snapped which then releases a flood of fluid. I also think I’m acting out of fear. But fear of what? Lastly I did start therapy this week."
depression,2020/04/17,"Dealing with a depressed dad Hi guys this is probably a rant but I don’t know what else to do. 
I am 25F and my dad (55M) is depressed and emotionally unstable/immature. 
A couple years ago he revealed to us at home that he grew up in an abusive home (his dad was an alcoholic and physically abusive/possibly sexually abusive). Prior to telling us this he used to idolize his father in an almost obsessive way. I am a girl but he named me after his FATHER and gave me a male name as my middle name. 
This childhood abuse makes sense because he has always been emotionally immature and irresponsible. I am 25 years old and I have NEVER depended on my dad. He is terrible with money and always in between jobs. He also worked in many different countries when i was growing up and so we have never had such a close relationship. 
My dad is a very traditional indian/Hindu. He does not believe in going to a doctor for his depression but has attempted suicide multiple times. Instead he goes to gurus and yogis to help him and has an obsession with yoga. I do not believe this helps him because he is still depressed and searching for meaning in life. Because of this he is obsessed with helping the poor. This isn’t a bad thing i know, but he does it to the extent that he runs us into debt to give to others and STEALS things from our home to donate to others so he can feel good about himself while putting his own family through duress. It has caused a huge rift in our family as my mother is the only person who provides for my 2 siblings and i and he puts a financial strain on our lives with his desperate attempt to “find purpose”. But i feel bad for him because i know he is a very sad person on the inside. 
When my siblings and i started working he started asking us for money all the time so he could donate it or build yoga studios for his gurus. I am not trying to offend anyone but i do believe some of these gurus are scam artists and some of these yoga groups are like cults. I am not a religious person and I don’t think any religion is beyond reproach. I think he gets taken advantage of by these gurus who use him for his money. 
His siblings also take advantage of him by constantly asking him for money. Many people take advantage of him for money and he gives it to them because he needs to feel “fulfilled”. Then he comes to us and takes our money because he has none. 
As an aside, after high school i was accepted to every college i applied to and one was my dream school to study Aerospace Engineering. I was unable to go because my dad said he had no money. A couple years later when one of my cousins wanted to study at her dream school he offered to sell some of his real estate to pay for her education (as a donation) so he could feel good about himself. I have never forgiven him for this. He goes out of his way to provide for others and does NOTHING for my siblings, mom and i. 
No one in my family can tell my dad anything about his terrible money habits because he gets depressed and threatens to kill himself so we just have to let him do him for all these years. 
Now that covid-19 is happening we’re supposed to stay in our houses to avoid being sick. My dad has recently had a surgery and is diabetic so he is at risk for covid-19. My older sister is a covid-19 doctor on the frontline treating patients and isolated at the hospital. She has called and told my dad repeatedly to stay at home because things are bad. He refuses to stay at home and goes out everyday to build his yoga studio and make donations. He has taken my credit card and spent thousands on this studio and these donations in the past few weeks when i am currently out of a job due to covid and need to save my money as i am migrating to Canada to start a new life soon. 
This has been my breaking point so today I finally told him about his spending habits and the fact that none of his children feel like they can rely on him as a parent. It was a bad fight and he has not been talking to me since and seems upset. Now i am worried he might do something to hurt himself or that i may have made him more depressed which wasn’t my intention but i just lost it today after YEARS of dealing with his behavior. I have also dealt with an cocaine addicted cousin and i still feel like my father’s behavior has been more stressful to deal with. 
I don’t know what to do now so maybe someone can help me? It is not my intention to cause pain to anyone but how do you balance this? Must i always let him take advantage of me because he is depressed? I feel like his depression has ruined my life in many ways but I don’t want him to kill himself over things i try to address in his behavior. Should i just let him do as he pleases and then maybe i can go to therapy to help deal with the stress he causes me rather than try to address it directly with him seeing as he is not emotionally mature enough to handle criticism? Someone please help me."
depression,2020/04/17,"I'm depressed and i think my mother is the reason So to begin with, since i'm (19M)  13 years old I have started to think about suicide. In my life theory, life is pointless so the only reason to live for me is to enjoy life. Since about 4-5 years though, i have had shorter but also longer periods of time where nothing was fun anymore. Thats when i started to think about taking my life.

This came to a peak about 3 weeks ago. Since then until now, absolutely nothing has given me joy anymore. And that was kind of new for me because in past times, when I was on a low, i always found something to get my mood back up.

But with this situation I came to a realisation; if nothing brings joy into my life, nothing really matters. Nothing I do can change the situation, so it doesn't matter anymore. Only one thing matters; when will I end it. 
And that's how the past few weeks looked like for me. I just wake up at 1pm, eat, think about death and fall asleep again.

Now yesterday I was thinking about it. Why now? Why the last few weeks and not earlier?
So I was starting to think about the situation and when it all really started, what the cause of all this was.
Then I had the conclusion to all of this; my mom.


So to make things easier to understand you have to know some things about me and my mother.
I was always a person who had the desire of freedom, independency and privacy. This stood and still stands in direct conflict with how my mother treats me.
She always needs to know what im doing, there is no privacy. I have the feeling, in order for her to feel that i'm safe, she has to be in control of everything (quick reminder, i'm 19). Also She always things that her way of life is the best and She thinks she knows what the best way of life for others is. Now of course, She would never admit this but she really lets it hang out most of the time. Those two characteristics lead to a deadly mixture when it comes to me. I always feel supervisioned by my mother. If I want to have privacy, I need to go somewhere she isn't. If I tell her what i have planned, or what i might want to do and she thinks it doesn't suit me, she'll let me know. But not in a way of giving me her opinion about it. More like the more often she tells me, ""maybe"" it'll change me.
It begins with the coffee in the morning and ends with my choice of what i study.
Since 4 years, every time i put a fucking sugar cube in my coffee, she'll let me know that she doesn't like that. Every morning morning like in groundhog day. 

Basically what that causes is that I slowly stopped caring about my moms opinion. It don't care if she's right or wrong anymore. It doesn't matter. Because when she tells me her opinion, she doesn't try to help me, she forces her opinion of the imaginary perfect way of life on me.
My dad sort of feels the same way and tries to support me.
He talked about how i should figure out my own life and shouldn't be pressured (by my mom) to life a life i don't want to. At first I thought he was wrong about my mom but now i think what he said became reality.

Now when puberty started for me, I could never understand kids that would rage at their parents. Telling them their opinion, rebel and so on. I was always trying to be nice and chill but in order for that to work I could tell my mom anything in order to have no conflict (and thereby neither my dad) which worked out but that meant that i could not show my personality.

So when I got my first pc with 13 years that was where my life was when I was at home. I had a couple of really close friends where i could go to but when I was at home, my pc was the only place I could be at, feeling free.
2/3rds of my time I didn't live the life I wanted, I just said and did things to avoid conflict, mainly with my mother.

----

So to bring this into the context of why i feel depressed,
this is probably the first reason why. I never really had any conflict with my mom the past years, the trade of is that I feel kind of empty. I don't really feel that i have a personality.
Every part of my personality since i was 13y/o was just a show to fit in.

Another cause of my depression is, that i started to let my mom know that i don't trust her and that i don't want to hear her opinion. I know that I hurt her by reacting abherent, which made me feel that I don't deserve her affection (regardless of the stuff, she still loves me).
In an article, I've read that one reason of a depression can be that the person thinks he doesn't deserve affection and love. 
This is where I started to think that i'm depressive.

With that said my only hope for things to change is that i move out. But there are some problems with that;
Problem n°1: it's not gonna happen in the next couple of weeks unless I move to my dad. He offered me to move in and I think i'm going to do that the next week or so.
Problem n°2: my mom will still have this negative kind of influence on me (because we would still have close contact). I don't want my life to be negatively impacted by her. On the other hand, if I give her a cold shoulder, it could possibly worsen my depressive feelings.
I can't just tell my mom the situation im in. She would be in denial and tell me that i'm creating all those problems by myself.

My questions are,
should I move to my dad's house?
should I tell her about it?
Should I tell my dad about it?
Is it helpful to get help through a psychotherapist?"

It started years ago when my (21F) boyfriend (23M) mentioned to me that he’s never actually happy. He will laugh and have fun but he’s never actually happy. Since then, I’ve encouraged him to go to a doctor. He decided to see one and was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and sleep deprivation. However, he never went back to get medication, nor did he seek therapy or receive any kind of professional help. It constantly affects our relationship and so I asked him to get therapy. After much delay, he decided to go and from an outsiders perspective, it seems as though the therapy was slowly starting to help him manage his depression. Since the coronavirus pandemic sent us home from college, he’s been getting worse. Not showing up to online classes and missing assignments. He’s also been distant and I have no idea what he’s thinking or doing. 

I just want to make sure he’s okay but don’t know how to help since we can’t see each other. We recently got into an argument because his depression has made it hard for me because it feels like I’ve been carrying the relationship for a long time. I have never had depression before so I have no idea what the experience is like. All I can do is sympathize and try to understand as much as I can from an outside perspective. And this isn’t about me but his depression has deeply affected our relationship. I wanted to break things off but immediately regretted saying that. I think that really hurt him and he hasn’t spoken to me in over a week but said he will reach out when he’s thought about things more. I don’t know what to do. I want to help him and our relationship. I want to be there for him. Do I reach out? When should I reach out? Would trying to talk to him when he isn’t ready going to make things worse? He says that he did see a future with me but now things are foggy. I’m not quite sure if this is linked to depression. Maybe some of you guys can help elucidate this situation for me. 

I want to ask those of you who know what it’s like to experience depression about what helps you the most. I care so much about him and I just want to do what’s best for him, his mental health, and our relationship."
depression,2020/04/18,"Zoom Study Room Hi everyone! My name is Mike (22 yo) and I am one of those who find it extremely difficult and depressing to study alone at home during quarantine. I tried to create a group for anyone who wants to work/study with other people because I personally find it easier and more motivating. I want to ask you to help me with studying and I will help you in return. I bought a premium on zoom so that we can have 24/7 study meetings non-stop, join and leave whenever you want (not gonna charge anything for this at all, never-ever). 

This zoom study room was created just a few days ago and it already had 2 meetings with wonderful and positive people from around the world: Australia, United Kingdom, Kazakhstan, India, France, Italy, United States and more. Right now there are more than 130 participants which join meetings using video at convenient for them time, so someone is always online and working.

In addition, I know how hard this can be in times of complete lockdown... I couldn't properly study for last 3 weeks, since the beginning of the quarantine. During my university times I used to go to the library all the time, and now this, without seeing friends, family, loved ones for weeks (I am an international student). Honestly speaking, so far zoom helped me a bit, at least when I seat and turn my video on - I actually start working by seeing that other people are also working. 

Feel free to add me to your contacts using the link below and I will add you to our group as soon as I see.

Hopefully it can help someone."
depression,2020/04/18,"I [20M] have had lifelong depression and isolation is destroying me. I'm 20 years old and have had a history of depression diagnosed at 9 paired with extreme anxiety. My depression has mainly manifested in two big waves, the second of which Im lost in currently. When I was younger it was what I would call an impersonal depression, it wasnt me depressed with my actions but was more or less cause by multiple family deaths within 12 months. The triggers for the first wave were far from invisible. I was blind sided and it hurt me for a couple years.

Fast forward to about a year ago, it started to creep back during a job that I had where the boss was a slave drive and who actively yelled at an berated daily. The constant day to day negativity was draining and I finally quit the job after 5 months of it. (Not that it was a super long time for a job). There was a massive weight lifted but it already did its damage. 

Now over the last 9 months my depression has slowly but surely kicked into turbo mode, and the current global situation has far from helped. I've been in a vicious cycle of self hate recently, stemming mainly from my weight but formed entirely of how I see myself. Not only do I hate the weight, I hate the look, I hate the voice, I hate the personality. My therapist asked me what I do like about myself and I honestly could not answer her. This then joins up with his asshole buddy loneliness, and they make a great tag team of ""you're ugly"" and ""you'll will always be alone"". I had finally really come to the conclusion of my depression and was about to try to meet new people, or join new groups to learn new skills, I was going to go to the gym again.

And.
Now.
This.

Well I'm not running around screaming like we're all going to die, but the idea of maybe being stuck like this for up to a year, is terrifying at best. 

My school year is over, well technically it isn't but my mind shut down the instant in person classes were cancelled. I can't go to any bar or join any university club to meet people. And now I can't even work out to at least tackle one aspect that I dislike about me.

I play video games all day, because I can't find anything else to do when I am not supposed to leave. This is beating down on me as everything is repetitive and I just can't have a proper conversation to the same level as face to face.

Every day is blurring into the next, while I would imagine the fogginess of days to be pretty universal right now. All the blurred days are painful and exhausting for me.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm horrendously alone with extreme depression, and just need some support as well as maybe suggestions for things to do to cope with this whole situation. 

TL;DR: ""I'm so blue, I don't know what to do."" -That Blueberry bitch from veggie tales."
depression,2020/04/18,"I make a minor mistake and instantly wish I didn’t exist is this normal? I (17M) have always hated myself as far back as I could remember, I remember going around in the first grade telling my class that I’m stupid, I don’t know why exactly I just do, I’m not good enough and it’s hard for me to like anything about myself especially my looks but also my personality sucks but whenever I make a small mistake I feel like I’ve ruined the lives of everyone who’s involved and I wish that I wasn’t such a burden. Is this normal for clinical depression?"
depression,2020/04/19,"I feel like I’m in a shitty simulation and I might as well test how bad I can be 26M Throw away account. I don’t don’t want to make this too long or confusing because I don’t want it to be looked over too quickly, so here I go. 

My life was like a movie from 18-23. But now every person I’ve ever known has stopped talking to me. Even the people I thought I had a lifelong bond with.


I feel like there is something off about me socially. A year ago I texted my mom and told her that I was severely depressed and her response was that I might have aspergers, that was the extent of our conversation. I turned it into a joke but I’ve never been able to get it out of my head. 

It makes sense, growing up I moved every year of my life but I do remember many people telling me they didn’t like me and they didn’t know why. 


I truly didn’t ask for this life. I know that’s so cliche to say, but I really didn’t ask for it and it’s unfair that I didn’t get the choice to choose what body and family I was born into. I definitely wouldn’t have chosen the 5’8 guy with a high pitch voice and severe social anxiety and the serial monogamist mom with bipolar depression and a lack of drive to bond with her son. 

I am going to do something very bad eventually and I don’t know what it is. I just know it deep down, I’m very afraid and ashamed of the places my mind goes sometimes, I know I’m capable of bad things. And now that I know there is no god (as he wouldn’t have given me this life and expected me to be just as good as the 6’ tall guy raised into a happy family that everyone wants to be friends with) there is no fear of eternal repercussions for what I will inevitably do, whether the thing I do is to myself or to a whole lot of people. 

I need help but I know if I stop pretending that I’m a cool guy with a successful life and admit there’s something deeply wrong with me I will never live a truly fulfilling life, my life will never be like a movie again because I will forever be the troubled guy. 

Tldr 
I’m capable of doing very bad things and I know I eventually will. I don’t know what to do."
depression,2020/04/19,"I wrote this when I was 14 to this subreddit. Didn’t post it and found it just now: Suicidal 14 year old’s guide to getting a bit better i wrote this when i was a suicidal depressed teenager. never posted it. i am now a depressed adult. hope it helps.

Hey guys. I've been browsing this subreddit for a decently long time now (around a year), and it has helped me so much. I read about people just like me. People that were struggling through the same daily endeavor of merely *living*. 

It almost became a second home from me. I would visit this subreddit in hopes of communicating with someone, or forming another bond with someone struggling. It was great, and I loved every moment of it. 

When people ranted, I provided support. When I was at a low, people provided support for me. A cycle of giving that never stopped. I fell in love with the people here, and the sub itself. It made everything just that tiny bit easier.

**Skip this part if you would like to see just the ""help"".**
*****

A little bit of background on myself. 

I am a student in high school that has moderate depression and more serious form of cyclothymia. For those who don't know, cyclothymia is a mental illness that causes one to have major mood swings that may strike at anytime. I may suddenly feel euphoric and happy and everything feels great, but it only lasts for a few hours or so. After that, I crash. I fall into a terrible low, and it is the opposite of the euphoria. There is not a single thing in the world that seems good to me, and all things wrong with my life just crash down and crush me. 

I've been suffering from this for around a year now. I'm not entirely sure what started it, but it was most likely a combination of my natural low self esteem, insecurity, and how badly I take failure. 

Up until around a week ago, this cycle continued until I completely broke down. I ended up taking a backpack full of medicine up with me to this forest that is located nearby. I was there for nearly an hour and ended up not doing anything. I cried for around 2 hours before I returned home. That was the day I decided to change. Here are the things that I decided to change/begin.

*****

**/r/getmotivated, /r/zenhabits, /r/frisson are absolutely great to look at when you're feeling down**

**Organize definitive but not too ambitious goals**
I made a list of goals on my iPhone. Definitive, but not too ambitious, goals. Things like ""get an -a on my geometry test"" etc. Also, make a list of the things you finished. It gives you an incredibly satisfying feeling when you look at the list.

**You're a phenomenon and should always believe that.**
Stop thinking of yourself as pathetic. Or useless. Or a horrible person. Because you're not. You can actually do something, and not be useless. Humans are fucking miracles, and you have no idea to what extent. You're no exception.

**Find a hobby, talent, or activity that you enjoy, and DO IT**
Go do something. Drawing. Writing. A sport. Work out. *IT HELPS SO MUCH.* You have no idea until you try it. I began to try to work on my fencing, and I started to go there very often. Working for something is a great feeling. Even if you can't do anything, learn something. It doesn't have to be complex or amazing. Just something you like or have an interest in.

**TAKE SHOWERS**
TAKE SHOWERS. It sounds really odd, but it works. A shower is a place to just calmly assess everything, and all the things you need to do/or want to do. You get out of it feeling clean, refreshed, and prepared for whatever you want/need to do.

**Sleep more. You underestimate its power and importance greatly.**
Get more sleep. This is a ridiculously important thing that many people overlook. Sleep is essential. It affects your thinking, performance, and general mood. I used to sleep at 12 to 2 every single day, and wake up feeling like everything in the world had gone black. If you take the time to prepare yourself and go to bed at 9 everyday, you will wake up feeling like you're not so scared. This is especially essential for those in school. Sleeping in class is horrible because you'll be behind in class and then have to lose sleep to catch up, etc. 

**Stay positive, because it'll improve other's attitudes towards you, and your own**
Be positive as fuck. Whenever you can, try to appear as confident as possible. Make people laugh. This aura is infectious. If people see you as someone to look up to, or enjoy, they will like you. I am an introvert, and people aren't always enjoyable. I disregard this, and try to appear fun or likable even if I feel hollow inside. If you have no friends, then this is still important. Look in the mirror and think ""What a classy motherfucker."". This will begin to soak into you, and make your attitude about everything a little better.

**Don't procrastinate.**
Don't procrastinate. Do your shit. [This always helped me](http://i.imgur.com/Qk0B8Mq.jpg). Don't think about it. If you're doing it, then keep doing it. Think of how good it feels when everything is done, and you're worry free.

**Try /r/nofap**
This is also a bit odd, but try /r/nofap. It's pretty interesting, I suggest you go on it and read a little on the sidebar(not nsfw). It's the ultimate challenge from you to your mind. If you keep this alongside what you're doing, you'll develop a willpower that'll be hardpressed to bend.
*****

***TL;DR:***

**Try /r/nofap**

**Don't procrastinate.**

**Stay positive, because it'll improve other's attitudes towards you, and your own**

**Sleep more. You underestimate its power and importance greatly.**

**TAKE SHOWERS**

**Organize definitive but not too ambitious goals**

**You're a phenomenon and should always believe that.**

**Find a hobby, talent, or activity that you enjoy, and DO IT**


Thanks for reading this long ass post. These are the things that have helped me so far. I'm feeling pretty great, and better than I've done in a while. I do realise that many of the advice is either repeated often, or not applicable. I urge you to try it, and if it doesn't work, what harm has come of it? 

Good luck guys, and have a nice day."
depression,2020/04/19,"I need advice. My(26F) husband(30M) doesn't seem to understand me. Time and time again I've told him I've been dealing with depression and anxiety. I've dropped hints, talked about wanting to go to therapy and maybe find a medication that might help me get back in a better mindset and get my motivation back. And yet I don't feel like he gets it. I know he is a good person and he cares for me but at the same time he is the only person that makes me feel bad about my current state of mind. I don't think he's intentionally trying to make me feel worse about myself but his little comments and lack of caring about how I'm feeling makes me feel worse. I've just had such a lack of motivation lately with everything. I haven't been taking care of myself or our house lately. I've been drinking more(I know we're quarantined but it's been this way for a little while), not eating the best and haven't gotten the motivation to clean around the house. I try to workout/do things around the house but it feels like a minute later I'm exhausted. My focus is all off. 
I know that isn't right but i feel he just sees it as me being lazy instead of realizing that I'm struggling. It's hard for me to talk about how I'm feeling but I have broken down about it in the past during small arguments. He has been in a depression before and I could always tell and I tried my best to comfort him during those times. I guess what I'm getting at is that I wish he was as receptive to how I'm feeling as I always am to him. Am I wrong for expecting him to pick up on the fact that I am struggling? Like I said, I even notice a difference in my own behavior and it's so hard to break through that. I just wish he would notice too and help me through it. Am I wrong for expecting that of him?

TL;DR I don't think my husband understands how I'm feeling. I need to know if my thinking on the situation is right. Could use advice on how to handle this."
depression,2020/04/20,"I feel lost about my GF struggling with depression and drug-related trauma Not sure if this sub is meant for advice about friends struggling with depression and stuff, but here I go.

16M, My GF (also 16) has depression running in her family and probably has depression too. Last summer she smoked way too much weed and maybe drank a little alcohol too, causing her to ''go bad''. I don't know what exactly went down, she didn't want to open up that much and I tried to respect that. The problem is: She can't think back to the early times in our relationship AT ALL, because she doesn't like thinking about those times. She says it's all about her incident, and that she does not like to remember it. I have smoked a lot, but never did something happen like this.

Now I am desperately trying to do the right thing, but I don't even know who I am at the moment, and I just find it really hard to imagine how she's feeling. I have never had this kind of experience and I feel like I'm losing her.

I am desperately, unmistakenly in love with this girl still, while it feels like she's pushing me away. I don't know what to do. I'm feeling really lost these past couples of weeks and one of the things I go to, to try and remember who I am is to think about the past, we've been together for almost a year now, which feels like ages when you're 16. 

I guess I'm gonna have to figure myself out on my own, but in the meantime, I would love to hear from some people who went through kind of the same stuff as my GF and are willing to talk about it. It all happened a long time ago, but the effects never went away.  It would really help to hear from some people what helped them, and maybe I could do the same. :)"
depression,2020/04/20,"Depression turned me into a worthless human. Iam 28M.  think I got depression somewhat under control in the last 2 years. I went from a self harming (have some big scars) suicidal 4 years long NEET to finishing college and having an ok job. I take better care of my health too and look better.

&amp;#x200B;

Still feel alone and sad. No family, no friends, no girlfriend... I feel like all those years living in isolation broke me. I guess I can't connect with people anymore...? I don't know... Can't get a friend, can't get dates... I have had so many flakes that I don't even feel like trying to talk to women with any romantic/sexual intentions anymore. I feel like a child desperate to be accepted by someone. Not having any family doesn't help either...

  
Today I woke up feeling really down. Has all this fighting been worth it? I have to numb my feelings of loneliness everyday to keep going. Forget it all and do my job, cook my meals, workout, study, try to get more money. But when I lay down in bed at night I still make no difference in anyone's life. Some nights I feel so sad I have lie to myself tomorrow it will be better. I have been lying to myself for these past 2 years, but deep down I wonder if I will be a worthless human being forever."

depression,07-28-2023,"Hi, I don't know how this subreddit works. But here I am (22M), a nerd, a software engineer, a cricket, coffee and trekking fan, a social introvert. The guy you'd casually ignore or just keep in your contact list as a ""good-to-have"". 

Tried to summarise it as much as I could - 

Checkpoint 1 - When I was 12, I was basically abandoned by all or any friends I had. To this day I have no idea. I just show up to school one day, and no one's talking to me. It was perhaps one of the worst years of my life. I would show up to school everyday and just cry my eyes out and literally no one bothered to ask. NO ONE. 

Checkpoint 2 - I had my first girlfriend at 16. We both dated for an year before she left me for her best friend at the time. They both dated for 7 years after that. 

Checkpoint 3 - I had this small group (2 guys including me and, 2 girls) of friends in my last year of undergrad college. I felt really comfortable in that group. For 6 months they hadn't told me that the other guy (supposedly my closest friend in college) and one of the girls sort of dated but split and hence even the group split silently. But they never told me and kept pretending. Slowly the group calls, messages, meetings died, and I was always under the assumption that it was the study pressure. Until one day they told me, I was back to being 12 again. I felt abandoned all over again. The group was dead but I was only finding out 6 months later. 

This happened right when college was ending, it was awful considering I felt I'll lose my friends anyway to adulting and as an engineer I'll be doing a remote desk job for the longest time before I become a manager or something. Being an introvert 

Checkpoint 4 - Shortly after checkpoint 3, I dated the other girl of that group for 2 months. She left me for reasons which are still ambiguous to me. Stuff like her expectations from the relationship were different, she was looking for something else, she is an introvert too. This is when we clearly talked about our expectations before starting the relationship. 

The last one broke me, tore me apart. I believe after checkpoint 2, I started blocking my feelings. Just simply suppressing stuff. I became very solid, people would just say that I've become mature, but I know I cannot even let out a scream if I wanted to to blow off some anger. I became very numb. You could come up to me, slap me in the face, and I still wouldn't mind as much. After the last one, all of it hit me all at once, and I've been a mess ever since. I have survived, but it's more or less the suppression technique. I was entirely lonely the next year. I would go days without talking to ANYONE. I don't have a talkative relationship with my parents. no calls, texts nothing. This was when I needed someone. So I ultimately decided to start therapy. Which has helped me resolve some other childhood and self image issues but it's a slow process. 

 I'm barely a moment of inspiration away from ending it. I decided to shift to Melbourne for my master's, to try and start a new life. It's the same here, I still don't know how to make friends. I feel lonely in a new city, and I just feel tired of this charade."
depression,07-28-2023,"I'm not sure if this is the best community for this so please redirect me if it would be better somewhere else... 

My brother (36M) was hit on his motorcycle by an RV and has a comminuted tibial plateau fracture and open fibula fracture. He just had his 2nd surgery to fixate with plates etc and they couldn't get a catheter and he had to be transferred to another hospital with a urologist there had to use a wire and a camera etc etc. Anyways, he has been in a lot of pain. He's very depressed and hopeless since then. 

He's had bad depressive episodes, nearly suicidal in the past even when things were going well, so I'm very concerned now. Nearly everything he loves that keeps him sane has been taken away. We moved to a small town and he's always felt isolated and unloved even though all my friends love him and support him even now. But he can't do things he's loves; he can't mountain bike, he can't play the drums, he can't drink. He doesn't have an outlet any more.

I've been his caretaker, we're best friends and I'm happy to be there for him. We can make each other laugh more than anyone else. And it's been hard to see him so dejected. He can't cook, can't do laundry, can't get up by himself. I'm just concerned about his mental health going through this. I don't know what to say or how to help. I'm worried about leaving his oxy with him at night honestly. He doesn't even want to take opiates but after his second surgery he's been so depressed, I'm worried about OD.

If anyone's gone through something similar, what was helpful? Any specific activities that helped keep you busy? Really any advice is appreciated. He's going to be nonweight breathing for at least 3 months. Probably 6 months before he can walk on his own. And i can only imagine what a hill that is to climb. I'm just feeling lost, like I can't do anything to help. I just want to be supportive and make things as good as I can, let him have as much independence as possible.

If nothing else, thanks for listening to my rant."
depression,07-28-2023,"I [18M] have been struggling my entire life just to keep my life in balance. Still coming from a struggling family, life has been absolute shit. I don't even remember the last time I've actually ever felt happy or alive. Every single day is a struggle for me and my family. My mom is struggling to keep her job because she can't use her car due to other complications that happened recently, my dad doesn't really help much, doesn't even check in on us and see what we need help with, my older brother is the only one who is helping us and he's struggling to barely keep up with the expenses, I've been trying to get a job for over a month now and I've been trying to get my ID for such a long time now and I haven't been able to get it since we have no form of transportation and I don't have all of the papers I need to get my ID taken out. 

I just feel so hopeless about my future because we've been stuck in this same spot for our entire lives and everytime we try to bring ourselves back up, something happens and we just go back to being at the same spot that we were in, hell probably an even worse spot than before. I just don't know what to do anymore, I don't know how to get out of this spot. I don't know if l will ever be able to study what I want to study in College and I fear that I will stay in this same spot for the rest of my life. My mental health is slowly deteriorating and I feel more and more hopeless about my future. I know I shouldn't be talking about my and my family problems but I just don't know what to do or who to talk to anymore. I just want to feel happy and alive again. I don't wanna keep suffering anymore."
depression,07-27-2023,"I'm a 28M that has gone through hell in his twenties. My depression and anxiety started in college and looking back it was manageable. Instead I decided to take antidepressants which started my psych med journey up until where it is now. I've taken a laundry list of medications in the past 6 years and am on five meds right now. The combination of these medications isn't working at all and I actually want to withdraw off of all of them at this point.

My job situation is hopeless. Out of college I decided to accept an offer from a job that was not the right fit for me by any means. My judgement was completely off and I regret making that decision to this day. I somehow ended up working there for four years part of the reason being that my manager knew I had mental health issues so he didn't lay me off. I tried to switch jobs the whole time I was there but I was too depressed.

Finally in the fourth year I resorted to using a stimulant to help me work on my resume. I thought it was worth it since I believed the job was a big reason for my depression. Turns out abusing the stimulant made my mental health way worse. I ended up going to a psych ward and rehab last year. I had to move back home and am now living with my parents. I decided to quit my job after the psych ward and ended up being unemployed for a year and a half. My parents were on me to find a job and they pressured me into returning back to the same company.

So here I am on five medications working at the same company that gave me hell for four years. I barely function at my job and I work with customers even though I have severe social anxiety. I actually hope I get laid off. My goal is to get a new job and move to New York but theres two problems with that:

1. I don't even want to get a job in my current field. Working with customers sucks when you have social anxiety.
2. I can barely take care of myself. Won't be able to live independently.

Was actually living in NY before for 6 months but had to move back home because of my mental health issues. I've tried to manage my depression and anxiety but its at its worst now. Along with medication I've been in therapy for 6 years.

I'm bedridden right now and helpless. I'm also braindead and have no personality. Its at a point where when people talk to me I can barely give a response back. I need serious help. I have basically lost hope. I seriously dont see a way to get out of my situation and thats why everyday I struggle with thoughts of unaliving myself.

**TLDR,** I've had mental health issues for six years now and in the last year I've gone to a psych ward and rehab because of drug abuse. I quit my job but am now back at the same job because I need income. It's either quit again and stay at home living with parents or continue to work there even though it causes me severe stress and anxiety.

depression,07-27-2023,"hello, i’m a 19M, i was diagnosed with depression when i was 13 and ever since then my life has been a constant shit show, many things have happened from that day until now that have made me wonder if i even want to continue on living, the only thing holding me back is my family is actually great and although we do our own thing most of the time i am incredibly grateful for them. anyways, all i do now is chronically smoke weed, my lungs are absolutely fucked and i should take a tolerance break and let it heal a bit but i need to smoke… i can only hit bongs before dab pens or even 4 digit number edibles don’t get me as high as i want as bongs do, i also am not in the best of shape and i’m unbelievably self conscious and i know i should work out but i just don’t, i do have a few “friends” but they mainly make me feel like shit about myself and my life, i have a job as a line cook but my co workers treat me as a joke, because ultimately i am, i wish in youth i was smarter about my actions and paved my life in a better direction, i’ve tried many different types of therapy snd medication but alas i’m at square one again, people love to say “you’re so young and you have so much more life to live” but for what? the same shit i’ve been feeling the same way for almost close to 7 years and i don’t imagine it goes away in adulthood, i bet it gets worse, i have no future, no talent no aspirations and no motivation to live."
depression,07-27-2023,"Hi. I'm 25M and have been disconnected/discontent with my life since 5 years ago. I have been self-sabotaging ever since and have not made a proper relationship with anyone for a while now.

Started with a very toxic ex of mine that made me feel obliged to stay in our relationship. She made me feel like I was to blame to our early relationship due to the fact that I hade to focus on college more than her.

3 years went by and we broke up for good. It felt good yet completely different at the same time. It felt like I was relapsing the thought of having her around me. I have been on 3 different relationships after our break-up and none of them felt like her's.

I had a completely different outlook and approach towards life that I would be unbothered by anything. I kept to myself with my emotions and this resulted to me being closed off from my friends, family, and lovers. I have lost so many amazing connections because I kept pushing them away when I feel the slightest inch of depression. I always felt like keeping them away from me would do them better. Technically, it would but, what about me?

Recently, I was able to connect with an amazing woman. She was beautiful, smart, and we had similar tastes in hobbies. You guessed it, I just pushed her away again. I had a feeling of discontent and the fear of 'I would eventually just hurt her'. So I did cut her from my life. She was fragile and I dropped her like glass.

I no longer consider myself as a human being. All I do most days now is do things alone. I'm completely okay with it but, the thought of doing it together with someone will always linger in the back of my mind. So yeah, my contradicting thoughts have become the death of me."
depression,07-27-2023,"(23M) First of all I would like to make clear; I’m not here to seek compassion/sympathy, I’m just trying to fully explain my situation hoping to find voices of people that recognize my symptoms/side-effects and could hopefully point me in the right direction. I’m also crossposting on a few communities because that way I hope to reach the right people somewhere.

My situation: I’ve been depressed for over 14 years, I’ve had cognitive behavioral therapy for over 8 (non-consecutive) years. The anti-depressants I’ve tried/been on are Citalopram, Mirtazapine, Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Duloxetine, Fluoxetine, Quetiapine and I’m currently on Nortriptyline. While some have been more effective than others, I’ve never fully been able to recover from my depression. That’s also partly why my current psychiatrist has let me have ECT (electroconvulsive therapy).

After the first 11 unilateral treatments were unsuccessful we switched to bilateral treatments which I currently have received 31 of, bringing the total up to 42 treatments. Luckily I started to notice some positive effects of the bilateral treatments after the first few which is why we kept going. My depression started to relieve somewhat, bringing my suicidal tendencies down and making me more approachable and somewhat happier. This really helped me gain the confidence we were moving in the right direction and hopefully nearing the end of the treatments. Unfortunately as I received more and more treatments I noticed that, although my depression was getting lighter, my PTSD was getting worse and worse. I started having full-on panic attacks and anxiety attacks.

One particular thing I started to notice in my day-to-day life which is making me write this post, is that I’m having way too many (what I can only describe as) déjà vu’s per day. To clarify: I’ve had casual déjà vu’s in the past just as anyone else, what I’m experiencing now however is totally different. Every single day, every single thing I’m going trough/experiencing is making my brain having me think I’ve already experienced this. So what I’m saying is that every conversation I have and everything I see/hear is making my brain yell at myself that I’ve already seen/heard it and it’s making my inner thoughts conclude I’m sort of “reliving” my own life…

Let me be clear; I know that what I’m saying (that I’m reliving my own life) cannot be true and is impossible. I’m just saying my brain is constantly ringing a bell saying I’m having a déjà vu. I’ve obviously already asked both my psychologist and psychiatrist for help. Neither of them recognize this as being a side-effect of my medicines or the ECT treatments I’m receiving, nor do they know what the cause could be. Thanks in advance for having taken the time to read my story, I’m hoping to find people on here that recognize what I’m going through and/or could point me in the right direction find the cause and hopefully a solution."
depression,07-27-2023,"(11M) My parents got a divorce when I was about 8 years old and ever since that everything's been going downhill, I want to die all the sudden and my dog died. My cat's revenge is gonna die soon. My grandparents have cansir everybody just doesn't like me at this point I just don't want to be alive and I know I might get a lot of backlash.  For being this young and posting on here. Whenever I try to talk to my friends about me being depressed. They would tell me to man up. I just don't know what to do anymore."
depression,07-27-2023,"17M I just quickly wrote this.


So, I have not been diagnosed with depression but over the last few years I have began to wonder if I am depressed or am becoming depressed.  For like the last two-three years I have lost a significant amount of interest in things that I would normally get enjoyment out of.  It could be anything from watching a youtube video or podcast, playing video games, to passionate hobbies of mine such as road cycling.  Everything just is kind of bland now, and I’m left to be more bored.  Recently, I have taken a break from road cycling, something I actively work to improve on and I feel terrible about the fact that I just don’t feel like doing it right now, or for a while.  I’m like tired of it, I’d rather just do some easy activities in my day-to-day life.  I feel like something is wrong with me now because I just did not used to feel this way.  I used to be more energetic and ambitious and now I’m less positive about myself and more lazy.  

Should I be concerned about this?  Am I depressed?"
depression,07-27-2023,"I’m 20M, I work a full time job earning about £10-11 an hour idk, I didn’t check.

I didn’t get any grades from school or college as my school wasn’t equipped to help around my motor and learning disability’s.

I’m currently stuck in a factory job doing a repetitive task 1-2,000 times a day and I hate it but I have nowhere else to go.

I’m also in £5-6,000 debt with different companies as I took credit cards out at 18.

The only thing keeping me sane is my friends but I only see them when they come out to do drugs…

I have dreams and goals but I can’t even take 1 step towards them without taking 2 steps backwards.

I’m stuck in this horrible cycle that I can’t escape without completely restarting.

I’m not suicidal in anyway but I feel I’m going to make a stupid unreversable decision that will miss up my life for good."
depression,07-26-2023,"CW/TW: self harm, substance abuse


I don’t really know where to begin. I [30F] have been in a really dark place for half a week now. A little backstory, I’ve suffered with depression for most of my life, was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen, diagnosed with BPD in my mid 20s, and believe I’ve got some undiagnosed neurodiversity. I grew up in a house were feelings were never talked about, sadness was ignored or belittled, and I’ve always felt incredibly lonely.

Over the weekend, I accidentally discovered my partner [35M] has a porn addiction. We’ve been together for getting close to a decade now. The closest I’ve ever gotten to finding out he has a PA was around our 1 year anniversary, I learnt that he was sexting role playing with someone on Instagram. To me, that was a huge betrayal of trust and we almost broke up. He convinced me that he would change, we went to couples therapy together, and I thought that we had moved past it all. Anyway; it turns out that while he was no longer an active participant in his addiction, he has still been on porn sites every single damn day. He seems to think that he has never outright lied to me about the porn stuff, but: we have been dealing with him having erectile dysfunction for a couple of years now and he never once thought to make the connection or talk to me about it, and at one point to try and help our sex life I had suggested that he read me something dirty that turns him on (as I knew he enjoyed reading porn, and he enjoys reading his favourite novels to me) but he completely dismissed it and made it seem like he no longer read any porn. I’ve become an absolute wreck. I thought I knew everything about him. I thought we were close enough that he could of come to me about anything and I would’ve been able to be there for him with very little judgement. And I’m still somewhat understanding - I’m empathetic to what he’s probably going through right now after he’s been caught out and the breakdown of our relationship. But he has hit so many triggering things for me.

At first it was just the hurt and betrayal of trust and rejection sensitivity. Feeling like I’m not enough, like I’m not good enough. And that’s then triggered a major depressive episode for me. I’ve only been able to sleep once I get so drunk and stoned I can barely function. I’ve self harmed again. And he’s given me space like I’ve asked for, but in the middle of a depressive episode, it has then triggered all my old abandonment issues. There was a point were I honestly felt like I was 14 again, in the middle of a breakdown and just needing some form of comfort, and hearing people in the other room who know how distressed I am, and they just ignore it. I’ve completely regressed from all the healthy techniques I’ve developed over the years, and am back to all my shitty ones. Every time he talks to me, it’s to tell me he’s “booked a doctors appointment” or he’s “deleted all the browser history” or spoken to a friend, or found support groups online, or unfollowed people on Instagram. He hasn’t once asked how I’m feeling. How my mental health is handling everything. He has not checked in on me, but seems to expect my support to him. I feel so fucking lonely. I‘be never known how to sit in these awful feelings. I’ve reached out to one friend, and it was helpful to have someone validate my hurt and my feelings, but the day to day isolation is a lot. It’s just him, my cat, and myself in our house. All my friends and family live a fair drive away (and I don’t drive); and even if they didn’t, I don’t know how to really reach out for help. Or how to lean on anyone. I’ve only had two shifts of work, so I’ve felt really stuck in this house. I keep wanting to go out for a walk or something, but instead I can’t move, I’m just smoking and drinking and watching Gilmore Girls (which was a huge comfort show for me growing up).

I don’t really know why I’m posting here; I think I just need to get stuff out of my head."
depression,07-26-2023,"(43M) I've been struggling a lot lately. I feel like I'm slowly losing my desire for any and everything, even my hobbies. A lot of it is from money issues, I started a company late last year but I'm barely scraping by. I feel like I'm right back where I was months ago when I sought out a therapist for the first time. I was angry, moody and so apathetic to life that I didn't care if I was alive or not. Not wanting to unalive myself, just extremely indifferent. I thought I'd made a lot of progress, I had to stop going because I couldn't afford it w/ no insurance at the time. But here we are again. I've given up on online dating (it's never gone well for me) and social media in general, nobody puts any genuine effort into getting to know people anymore. I'm tired of trying to make connections with people, to relate to them, try and form friendships. I just don't care anymore. I decided last week to take a break from social media and to only focus on my business and getting financially stable. But it's not working exactly how I'd hoped. I feel more alone now than ever and realize how addicted I am to the social media dopamine fix, but I can't take how invisible I feel trying to be seen by people that don't care. Or at least realizing how just another stranger on the internet I am. I've never had luck with relationships, months ago I was at a point that I'd been single so long that just the thought of meeting someone or even attempting to date gave me anxiety. As I was sitting here at my PC, listening to music, it hit me that just the mere thought of a relationship sent me spiraling downwards. I have no hope that it will ever happen to me. I'm trying to learn to be ok alone, but I'm so tired of that. I'm really really tired of being surrounded by a loving family but feeling so hopelessly alone.

end rant."
depression,07-26-2023,"I don’t have strong opinions on anything, I just never have. Honestly, that feels relatively normal to me, I don’t care about things that don’t matter. I don’t have a favorite color or anything like that. My issue is coming about with not being able to feel love. I don’t feel like I love my family. I don’t feel like I love my girlfriend. Is this a problem? Do I need to do something about it?

For background, I’m 18M, on antidepressants, and seeing a therapist when I can. All replies are appreciated"
depression,07-26-2023,"I 23M am trying to cry, but I just can't. It almost feels frustrating and claustrophobic at times. It's almost been three months, but there has been no success so far. Only if there were a place where men could cry."
depression,07-25-2023,"Hi, first at all, my main language isn't english so I'm really sorry if I make some mistakes on my writing.

&#x200B;

The reason of why I'm writing this post is because suddenly, me (21M), an extrovert person doesn't really feel like talking to anyone anymore. Just want to push away my friends, I don't really care anymore, of course I aprecciate them so that's why I'm so curious about what's going on. I just want to study and earn tons of money, maybe with that I could be fine.

I really don't know what I'm doing posting this (maybe some why to express myself?) this isn't really something that I could tell to anyone closer.

Thanks for the space."
depression,07-25-2023,"Hello All I (24M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for 7 months and they have been the most magical 7 months of my life. I deal with severe anxiety, health anxiety, panic disorder and PTSD and my gf has been very very helpful and supportive through my tough times and I love her dearly. She has been the best thing to ever happen to me in my life and I love her to death and want to start a family with her. Unfortunately one day early last week I woke up and I felt as if all my love and feelings had disappeared out of the blue. Nothing happened between us and I am struggling with this ideology my brain has come up with. It’s like when I look at her I don’t feel the love or butterflies I did two weeks ago. Now for reference it feels this way with almost everyone in my life at the moment, including my mom, my dad, my love for cars, video games you name it. But this issue with my girlfriend has caused me to breakdown crying everyday because I don’t want to lose her like my mind is telling me to. I have been on Lexapro for 4 months now and at the same time I started omprezalone for GERD. Last Monday a day or two before these thoughts started my med lady switched me to protonix stomach meds and kept the Lexapro the same. She also had me taking almost 1000 mg of magnesium every day and 2000 IU of Vitamin D. My question is has anyone experienced this before and how did you overcome this ?? My therapist believes it is depression getting the better of me and that the new stomach meds I am on are causing a bad reaction. Please give me hope I want to marry this girl."
depression,07-25-2023,"Hey y’all. Been depressed since I was 16, 30M now, been on antidepressants for awhile. Now, my partner, best friend, and former lover is not speaking to me anymore. We’ve been living together for the past 2 years, one of which in isolation for a project, and things were never perfect but also never this bad. Our relationship history is long and complicated but now I feel like ending it all. I won’t because I’ve done the work to stop my suicidal ideation, but I really can’t live like this. I can hear her laugh on the phone in the other room. I haven’t eaten in over a day. I promised her that I’d keep our shit secret, so I can’t tell anyone about what I’m going through. Most people think we’re fine or just friends, but the reality is that I’m stuck on her so hard that I don’t know my own identity anymore. Not to mention that I rely on her for the majority of my work.

I don’t know what to do. I tried talking to her, she’s not allowing me to express myself. I know she doesn’t have to and she has to take care of herself, but I just hate living in my body right now. Does anyone have any ideas on how to help? Or can anyone just let me know I’m not alone? 

This is my first time posting here."

I domt feel like an adult coz i have high functioning AUTISM. I have missed out on so many things in life and i dont know if it is viable to try and achiev those things and cause myself mental anguish. Idk what to do. Should i work part time whilst studying in university????"
depression,07-24-2023,"I(24M) have been running a knife across my body everyday for the past two months. Honestly, I don't know if it's bad or not. It odly feels good. Again, I know how this sounds but bear with me. I went through some stuff recently. Lost my apartment, my job, all my savings, and moved back in with my mom on my birthday. I was pretty lost, but recently I've been motivated to do all sorts of stuff. I've been hanging at the library or studying all types of stuff like math and science. I want to be a scientist and I study chemistry in school. I've been loving my motivation, but it requires me to isolate. I haven't been worried about money. I have a job, but I have bills. And not much left over to do anything outside of being inside. But all I want to do is read. Sometimes I'm in my head too much and it gives me anxiety. I don't like medication but I found someting that gets rid of the flashes of memory that just comes at me. I run a dull steak knife across my chest and legs. They leave marks but fade. Sometimes the ones on my chest leave a small mark, but not enough to cut me. It feels odly satisfying and it gives me a rush of energy and then I go about my business like nothing ever happened. I am worried about having scars and I feel guilty when I do it cause I have never told a soul, let alone my mom. I don't like the thought of medication, and I like the pain. It sounds gross and perverted but it's true. I honestly wish I was making this up, but it's been helping me get though the day. At one point I was doing it every thirty minutes to keep myself productive, but now I just do it when I need a jolt of energy. I work out, I eat healthy, my muscles have never been bigger. Just benched 120lbs dumbbells for 6 the other day and curled 70lbs in each hand. The isolation gets to me sometimes, but I would rather work on myself and my projects so I don't really care nor do I feel like Im really missing out on anything. Sure I feel like I spent my summer indoors, but I feel like I'm doing good on myself. Im just doing this cause I like it. At least that's what I think. I'm not really sure if I'm depressed or not. I'm pretty anxious to post this but I would like an outside perspective and I'm happy to answer any questions"
