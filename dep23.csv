0,07-28-2023,"Recently, I started to feel so tired from everything, it seems like life lost its color and nothing gives me joy or happiness, my every single day is same. I was like that for years since I know myself but 5-6 months ago things were getting better and I started to feel better but then -bam- these feelings came back. Even when I recovered I realized life still was not joyful and giving me happiness at its fullest, I still had that emptiness-like feeling inside me but it was not that bad. 

A few weeks ago I started to feel tired again as if I used all of my life energy. On top of that, a few days after, I got death threats from my girlfriend's dad because he found our secret messages. The thing that made me sad wasn't the threat messages, because my own life doesn't have a meaning for me at all, it was our breakup because she was the only one that seemed to understand me and had the same problems as me. 

Some may say that 'You should find someone else'. You may be right but the problem is I think the relationships today are based on lies and money. No one tries to understand the other person, no one acts like the real itself, no one actually loves/likes someone, everyone uses eachother for their joy or other reasons. 

I feel so alone and I felt alone somehow when I was in relationship with that girl even though she understood me. I have friends that I'm very close with but I still think they are not the people that can actually understand me. I feel so alone in this world but I still don't want to meet with new people.

And all the time I had some kind of hate inside me against people, whenever I go outside when I look at peoples faces I feel disgust that I can't explain, I feel like they shouldn't exist we were all a mistake. Those thoughts were always with me but after the death threats from my ex-girlfriend's father (as if I did something too bad, which I didn't, we were just texting like a normal couple) thoughts got worse. It made me think that if there are people who gets mad and sends dead threats to people even for simplest things, the mankind itself is a mistake and there are people like this more than I thought.

This year, I'm going to university but like I said before I don't want to meet with new people, all friendships and relationships are based on lies and everyone is hiding behind a mask. And I think with this hate inside me against people, I can't socialize. Whenever I think those problems, I feel tired more than I was before. I want to and don't want to stay like this at the same time, my entire life can't continue this way. 

And I forgot to mention not only I hate humans, I hate myself, I did things that harmed me a lot in the past and I feel like I'm going to do them again.

I see two options, I somehow recover again and continue my life which I have no single idea about how this is going to happen, second is I stay this way and I either do things irreversible to myself or to my environment.

I don't know how I'm going to or what I can do to get better. Entire day I just sit in my room waiting for time to pass, isolated from everyone. I can't find any meaning in doing something and I feel like as my soul is tired from just being alive.

 You may think I have an unloving family, but no, I have a loving and caring family and pets but yet it does no good. My main problem is with life itself and my view to it.

I didn't talk about these thoughts of mine with someone close to me, neither to my family nor to my friends. I don't want them to get worried because I see myself as a burden and my life has no value. 

I may hate people but yet I'm here texting those anonimously because it feels better this way. Normally, I wouldn't tell any of my problems to someone, but now, I feel like I should. Because I don't have any idea how I'm going feel like a normal person again.

Well, to the anyone who read all those to this point, thanks, I guess.",15bzjqi,depression
1,07-28-2023,"She was the happy friend. The funny girl who was always laughing and putting smiles on people's faces. She seemed like she had the perfect life. But she didn't. She never wanted people to be worried about her so she put on a fake smile and pretended like everything was okay. In reality she was drained. She would come home and cry until she couldn't feel anything anymore. She wondered what would happen if she could just disappear. It would make everything so much easier.

She said she was okay. And you believed her? Let me tell you what's wrong with her. She is tired. Thats's exactly what she is, tired. She is tired of being hurt. She is tired of being let down. She is tired of being the second choice. She is tired of caring too little or not caring at all. She is tired of holding it all in. She is tired of feeling broken, damaged, worthless, never good enough, pain. She is tired of being judged for everything she says or does. She is tired of trying.

I have been having severe panic attacks that have been lasting for days, will go 3-4 days without sleep or food and it takes me a while to recover any bit of appetite. I am not new to this as it has happened in the past. I wanted to be proactive and begin therapy asap rather then wait until I inevitably start cutting my legs and wrists again and eventually putting a gun in my mouth. ANYWAY, had my first session yesterday and things went great, she was a perfect fit and listened and I was not rushed to keep it within the hour. I felt lighter and energetic, until 1 am hit. Laying in my bed shaking and sweating unable to breathe, dry heaving from having the crackers I was able to choke down.  I immediately went for my knife. Held it until I left for work, thinking about how easy it would be to stop feeling this way. It‚Äôs like I jumped the steps and the therapy appointment made me move quicker into suicidal ideations. 

I cannot take anti depressants as I have to maintain my security clearance for my job. However, I have my firearm with me at work and it is so very tempting.

There's no escape, I couldn't afford to leave, and also there's a major accommodation crisis here, so that's not an option.

12,07-28-2023,"Hello everyone. This is my first time posting here, I hope you will be kind.   


I am struggling hard with depression and I think I‚Äôve done something very stupid. I got a puppy. And now I regret it immensely and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

  
A little bit of backstory: I‚Äôve had constant persistent (but relatively low-level) depression for my whole life. (Probably since I was a little kid, actually ‚Ä¶ I remember playing this ‚Äògame‚Äô where I would eat candies and pretend they were pills and that I was killing myself.)  I never sought treatment for it because it was fairly manageable. 

  
However, at the beginning of this year, my husband left me. (One of his reasons was my ‚Äòconstant black cloud‚Äô, so maybe the depression wasn‚Äôt as well managed as I thought. :S) Since then I have really plummeted. The situational depression on top of the existing depression has been unbearable. I constantly think about ending my life, my friendships have almost all fallen away (can‚Äôt blame them, I‚Äôm fucking exhausting), I can‚Äôt work (I work for myself which is both good and bad, since there‚Äôs no one to force me to do anything.)

  
Recognizing that I couldn‚Äôt do this on my own, I got into therapy and decided to try anti-depressants for the first time. I started on Wellbutrin in June (we chose that one because low motivation has always been an issue for me). 

  
Well, if you‚Äôve ever been on Wellbutrin / Bupropion, you‚Äôll know there‚Äôs a little thing that often happens called the Wellbutrin Honeymoon, where for about a week or two, you feel AMAZING. All the energy and good vibes and ‚ÄòI can do anything!‚Äô feelings. I got that. I got it GOOD. 

  
I had been wanting a dog for a long time (even before my husband left) and I‚Äôd been going back and forth on it since living on my own. Once the Wellbutrin kicked in, I decided, YES. I‚ÄôM DOING THIS. IT‚ÄôS GOING TO BE AMAZING. I started the process to get my puppy. 

  
Now I have him. It‚Äôs been almost three weeks since I brought him home. I cry all the time. I feel so much regret. I have regular panic attacks (a fun new twist!) The meds have stopped working (I‚Äôve been on them six weeks now, so they should be at their full effectiveness, but I don‚Äôt feel any better than I did before.) My puppy has some pretty serious fear issues which are making the regular puppy-hood period even harder‚Ä¶ I thought a dog would help me get out more but somehow I ended up with one who is even more of a shut-in than I am. (I have experience with fearful dogs and I am sure this is beyond regular 'puppy nerves' and is almost certainly a temperament issue that will be an ongoing challenge throughout his life.)

  
I am considering returning the puppy because I‚Äôm not sure my mental health can take it. But on the other hand, the guilt and shame of returning him is also going to be hell. My therapist had a few suggestions like getting my meds adjusted (and/or trying a different one), and getting us into a puppy class and seeing how it goes (I already hired a trainer to help with the fear stuff but we haven‚Äôt been to a class with other people/dogs yet.) But those things all take time and I feel like if I‚Äôm going to return the puppy, the kindest thing to do is to do it sooner rather than later, before he can get too attached to me. 

  
But I just don‚Äôt know. He can be VERY sweet and sometimes I look at him and think, ‚Äúwe can figure this out‚Äù and other times I spend an hour hiding in my car and bawling. 

  
I‚Äôm so sorry this post is a million words long. (It‚Äôs been cathartic for me to type it all out!) If you‚Äôve gotten this far, I guess my question is: has anyone ever gotten a pet to help with depression? Was it a mistake? Did you keep it? Return/rehome it? What was the outcome? I know this is a decision I have to make for myself but as you all probably know, decision-making is extremely hard (impossible, it feels like) when you‚Äôre this low.

14,07-28-2023,"I‚Äôm 25 m and I don‚Äôt belong anywhere. I don‚Äôt believe life was made for me to enjoy, only to suffer. I genuinely think I‚Äôm going to die by suicide eventually because frankly, I detest my life. I‚Äôve been depressed for the past 7 years and things just keep getting worse.

Now why do I hate my life? Because I‚Äôm alone all the fucking time and I know that‚Äôs not normal. People my age are partying, dating, and developing their careers. I‚Äôm not doing any of those things. I‚Äôm unlovable. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm alone. People have always hated me. For some reason, the general public and even my family doesn‚Äôt jive with who I am naturally. I‚Äôm a reject. An outcast. And I‚Äôve never understood why.

Backstory:
-I‚Äôm an only child. I grew up alone. I was born and raised in the US to foreign parents who never cared for American culture. I was never allowed to hang out with kids from school. It‚Äôs not like I could anyway, no one in school liked me! I was mercilessly bullied all throughout elementary and middle school having been the only black kid in a predominantly white school/area. Kids called me ugly. They called me faggot. I internalized that shit.

-I‚Äôve never had a relationship with my father. A lot of black kids have never met their father. I can‚Äôt say the same. My father lived with my me and my mom until I was 16 when they separated. My entire life, my father has never spoken to me -literally. I‚Äôve never had a conversation with the man. He only ever went to work and watched television. That‚Äôs it. To this day I fucking hate Jerry Springer and Maury because that‚Äôs all he ever watched. I haven‚Äôt seen my dad since I was 16. He‚Äôs never once bothered to call me or see how I‚Äôm doing. He never loved me.

-My relationship with my mom is complicated. I love her but I hate her also. I love her because she loved me growing up vs my father. But she also beat me. She wasn‚Äôt abusive but she hurt me so bad physically as a kid that it fucked me up emotionally. I always wish she‚Äôd just talk to me like someone who understands logic, because I was intelligent. But she never reasoned with me and always went for the belt. I guess I forgive her because all black kids get beat. I hate my mom because she never pushed me to follow my dreams as a kid and she forced me into her way of thinking ‚Äì to care about what people thought of me. I needed to be a certain way or else I wouldn‚Äôt be loved. I could never just be myself as I wasn‚Äôt enough. We argue all the time to this day, she can never be wrong, and never apologizes for anything.

-I‚Äôm gay. Was in denial about it until college. Turns out I only like white guys. White guys think dark-skinned black dudes are ugly though in my experience. I cry about it every night, how I‚Äôll be alone forever. Seriously, every person I‚Äôm into rejects me. I‚Äôve been rejected so many times I‚Äôm fucked up. I don‚Äôt think people understand how annoying it is to be gay and unattractive. Gay people are the most superficial people. They don‚Äôt gaf about your heart, it‚Äôs all about muscles and dick size.

-My extended family doesn‚Äôt gaf about me. Always excluding me in group chats and talking shit behind my back thinking I don‚Äôt know. When i show up to family events, no one asks me about my life because they don‚Äôt care. I gave up on trying to have a relationship with them.

:end of backstory

Honestly, I feel like life has sucked the positivity and hope away from me. I was a happy and confident person once upon a time but as I get older I get more and more bitter. I hate myself. I hate my body. I hate that I always have to be the person to make the first move in a relationship or friendship. I hate that I‚Äôm not interesting enough for people to approach, question, or talk to. I hate my ex-boss who fired me because he hated me and caused me to almost commit suicide because I couldn‚Äôt find another job for the longest time. I just want life to not suck but literally everything is a struggle.

I apologize and he squeezes my shoulder hard. So I get up he punches me in the chest, I push him he falls. Then I lost it. I don't remember how many timed I hit him in his shoulder only. Then his buddies pull me off him, he kicked my fist pretty good it's bleeding. So the bartender said to just go home he will convince the jerk that if he calls cops it's was his fault anyway. But yeah... So excited to have a girl ask me that and this happens. Walked home with my hand wrapped in the bottom of my shirt hoping a cop didn't stop to ask what happened, I was so freaked out.

I never realized how much she loved me until we had our last talk, the day before she died. Our relationship had been so confusing sometimes, but when we were talking for the last time, our egos finally faded and I could see her for who she was, what she did. She told me she loved me, and she died the next night. I took her for granted, when all this time I had a loving mother without realizing. Now I really am as alone as I've always felt.

I kept some of her things, they're sitting on my desk. But when I look at them, I get some terrible feeling I can't describe. Like momentary love, then nostalgia, then terror, then misery. And I can hear her voice speaking. I can't get rid of them, they're all I have left, but they make me so miserable. Same goes with the picture of her hung up in the living room.

I feel asleep with her rosary in my hand, but when I woke up I had accidentally broken it. I keep having nightmares about it where I meticulously but it back together, but it just falls to pieces in my hand.

I hear her voice in my head at seemingly random times. I can hear her walking through the house, or talking in the another room. I heard her laughing one morning a week ago, as if she was in the living room, but I know she can't be there. I guess it's just my mind wishing she was still here.

I know she just wants me to be happy. She told me as much. But I can't be. I don't feel any positive things, and faking it doesn't work anymore. I deleted my methods of communicating with my friends, because I don't feel like I can face them anymore. My best friend particularly, I just can't even think about bugging him. He was so supportive of me. He told me he didn't mind how clingy I was being after my mom's death, but I could tell I was annoying him. We always called ourselves soul brothers, but after my mom died even the closest interaction feels distant. Like I'm not really there with people, like I'm not even alive. So I cut myself off to stop forcing my pain onto him and others.

I cut myself for the first time in a long time, and I did it more than ever before. I almost did it on my wrist, to see if I'd die. I still somewhat wish I could.

All my passion is gone. Everything I ever loved feels foreign to me. What am I supposed to do now? Is there anyway to regain any positivity? Was cutting myself off from my friends a bad idea? Are grief-induced hallucinations normal?",15bv8fu,depression

I've tolerated so much shit in my life, in the three and a quarter decades of it. Tolerated so much of other people's shit, offline and online. Seeing everything I've once loved just deteriorate before me, whether it was by my hands or someone else's.

I refuse to grow too old to the point of fragility and exploitation from vampiric insurance companies and the sick joke of whatever is left of retirement, SSI .etc

I'm very unimpressed with the decaying world and the society that clamors it on in many ways.

34,07-28-2023,"Hi there, first time posting here, I'm passing through a really down time rn.
I'm doing grad school in America while my girlfriend is finishing her MBA in Europe, since grad school is so badly paid I could only afford to go and see her for a couple weeks each year. 
I hate my life, I hate myself, I hate where I am, I hate my life here, I hate that I cannot go with her, I hate that I choose grad school that only gave me anxiety and depression and I hate my degree.  
I only wake up early so I can talk with my girlfriend due to the 8 hours difference, I can only bring up to do basic tasks. 
It depresses me how academic life is, working extensive hours with a payment below minimum wage. 
I want to go with her, find a job somewhere near her but that's so fucking hard to do from America. It's so suffocating that when I told my parents (that are in another country) that I wanted to go to my girlfriend they started saying shit and crying saying that she's manipulating me to stay away from them. 
I'm on therapy that it's working slow and I feel trapped in this cycle and I don't see how this thing is going to end up. Honestly, I just don't kill myself because I don't want to hurt my parents and girlfriend and because I'm still looking forward our future.

35,07-28-2023,"Id like to preface with one thing: I'm not actively suicidal. At least not to the point of planning or anything akin to it. Hello, I'm Pirate, and I've attempted suicide more than 10 times throughout my 20-25 years of life, though I've honestly lost count of the exact number.

Four years ago was the last time, but up to then I experienced one type of suicide attempt: The kind where I just wanted to escape - for things to be peaceful and quiet(The kind where I ""regretted it on the way down"" so to speak). Four years ago was another: the one where I really, truly wished to die. Where even after there wasn't much regret in my mind. That second type is why I'm here, I want to know if others feel like I do now; after it.

I was always aware of the saying that ""everything has a price"", and of course I was aware that the price of suicide was my life. That all was obvious, I was less aware; however, that I wouldn't get that price back when I survived. The night I truly wished to die, and that following morning when I woke up,  I lost something - and I can't seem to get it back. It's a funny little feeling - I still have my knowledge, my mind - things still ...work. But it feels like a piece of my soul itself, my very *being*, was given up that night. I suppose it makes sense, thinking about it more. We cling so tightly to life, to properly give that up...well it's a bit like Atlas trying to pick the sky back up, isn't it?

To be quite honest it's made recovering from depression quite difficult. It feels like I'm partially dissociated, and just can't completely come back anymore. I have autism: I already felt like I was shifted one dimension away from the people around me. Now it's just another. Being two dimensions away is honestly quite hard, it's like a milder form of that deep, drowning depression I know well. That's why I'm here: I want to know if others feel this way. I want to know what they do, if they got better - I want help in getting back, even just a little. No matter if you have advice or don't, I appreciate you for listening to my story here. Thank you.

46,07-28-2023,"Hi, I don't know how this subreddit works. But here I am (22M), a nerd, a software engineer, a cricket, coffee and trekking fan, a social introvert. The guy you'd casually ignore or just keep in your contact list as a ""good-to-have"". 

Tried to summarise it as much as I could - 

Checkpoint 1 - When I was 12, I was basically abandoned by all or any friends I had. To this day I have no idea. I just show up to school one day, and no one's talking to me. It was perhaps one of the worst years of my life. I would show up to school everyday and just cry my eyes out and literally no one bothered to ask. NO ONE. 

Checkpoint 2 - I had my first girlfriend at 16. We both dated for an year before she left me for her best friend at the time. They both dated for 7 years after that. 

Checkpoint 3 - I had this small group (2 guys including me and, 2 girls) of friends in my last year of undergrad college. I felt really comfortable in that group. For 6 months they hadn't told me that the other guy (supposedly my closest friend in college) and one of the girls sort of dated but split and hence even the group split silently. But they never told me and kept pretending. Slowly the group calls, messages, meetings died, and I was always under the assumption that it was the study pressure. Until one day they told me, I was back to being 12 again. I felt abandoned all over again. The group was dead but I was only finding out 6 months later. 

This happened right when college was ending, it was awful considering I felt I'll lose my friends anyway to adulting and as an engineer I'll be doing a remote desk job for the longest time before I become a manager or something. Being an introvert 

Checkpoint 4 - Shortly after checkpoint 3, I dated the other girl of that group for 2 months. She left me for reasons which are still ambiguous to me. Stuff like her expectations from the relationship were different, she was looking for something else, she is an introvert too. This is when we clearly talked about our expectations before starting the relationship. 

The last one broke me, tore me apart. I believe after checkpoint 2, I started blocking my feelings. Just simply suppressing stuff. I became very solid, people would just say that I've become mature, but I know I cannot even let out a scream if I wanted to to blow off some anger. I became very numb. You could come up to me, slap me in the face, and I still wouldn't mind as much. After the last one, all of it hit me all at once, and I've been a mess ever since. I have survived, but it's more or less the suppression technique. I was entirely lonely the next year. I would go days without talking to ANYONE. I don't have a talkative relationship with my parents. no calls, texts nothing. This was when I needed someone. So I ultimately decided to start therapy. Which has helped me resolve some other childhood and self image issues but it's a slow process. 

 I'm barely a moment of inspiration away from ending it. I decided to shift to Melbourne for my master's, to try and start a new life. It's the same here, I still don't know how to make friends. I feel lonely in a new city, and I just feel tired of this charade.",15bodvk,depression

I've been having issues remembering all the racing negative thoughts after my depressive episodes end so I'm going to write them down and keep track. My childhood was so stressful and abusivr and shitty I forced myself into acting like it was fine and then repressing it and refusing to accept it and now it's like it's all coming back. I can't lay down with my eyes closed and try to sleep because all I can think about are horrific events like being 5 and having to take care of David during his constant seizures all on my own. He would literally die every time and I had to bring him back. If I didn't act fast enough, or correctly he would die. And it would be my fault. His seizures were daily, sometimes not even at the house because we walked to school alone in Lansing. At 5. I have trouble remembering what's happened except for when I really just sit and close my eyes and try to sleep. It feels invalidating. I feel like I've lost my childhood, which I never really got to have because I had to become the man in charge when I was 5. I've refused to accept what happened and now I feel lesser because I've forced myself into having issues remembering so I can't even come to terms with myself for it. It's all so fucked. I feel like I've fucked David and sage over too. There was one point where I'd started to take my anger out on sage through abusive actions because it was just too much for me to handle at the time with how young I was and even though it was only for a few months when I realized what I'd started doing it fucked me up bad. Dealing with such self hatred at such a young age. Becoming the person who was ruining my life. I was maybe 7. My mom had basically abandoned me. Us. The only attention she gave us at all was yelling or horrible violence I can't even talk about without crying. I had to be there for sage and instead I started turning into her and I don't think he's ever forgave me for it and I don't put it past him. It's my fault. I just acted like everything that was going on was normal and refused to accept it and now that I'm mature enough I'm still struggling with it. It feels horrible. Like I'm fucked up. I feel like I'm going crazy and it's dehumanizing to experience. Even now I can't force myself to remember most events that really fucked me up and I feel so invalid. Maybe it wasn't that bad. Maybe I'm over exaggerating. But then I'll be trying to sleep and all I can see with my eyes closed is just how fucked it really was. I've been chewing on my mouth in my sleep because of it. My tongue and cheeks. I never remember the dreams, at all, but I wake up constantly in my sleep, every 30 minutes to an hour, sometimes sweating, but completely unable to remember and its traumatic that what I've forced myself to forget can be so bad to elicit that response from dreams. There's a lot I do remember though and it isn't good. I wish I had a better way to cope with it as a kid. I can't even cope with it now. I'd started feeling so depressed thinking about what I should've done differently. How I could've made it better and had the initiative to try and make the most of it. I started borderline overdosing on stuff like Advil or ibuprofen and smoking a lot of weed to get a full body numb feeling. I wanted to completely clear my mind because mixing them made my mind blank. I feel so outcasted where I am today. I feel completely alone, how I was in my childhood. Sage hates me, although it appears he's making an effort since I've been trying to be there for him whenever he needs so he doesn't have to be alone like I did even though I've left them. I feel like I failed him. I should've done better. I have no idea what David thinks. He regularly took his anger out on me, either physically or verbally, although I don't think I blame him as id started to fall down the same hole. I feel disgusted for it but I don't think I hate my mom much for how she was. I think that adds to the invalidation I feel. She was horrible. Completely abusive and manipulative. There was slaps, punches, kicks, physically thrown around, chokes, and verbal run downs. Daily dehumanization. She used to tell me my father would hate me if he was still alive. She told me he would've beat me too. I was just a kid. I didn't know any better and I believed it. I believed I was worth nothing because that's how I was treated. I think I still believe I'm worth nothing. I could stand the beat downs but the hardest part mentally was the manipulation. It was always my fault. Everything. She would become so violent, completely belligerent in rage and take it out on me and run me down as a person. Afterwards she would always ""apologize"". Every single time. There was never any apologies. It was just words. She would use these apologies as copouts to put it on me. David was having a really bad seizure one morning and wouldn't start breathing again. I knew what to do to help as id been there for almost every single one he's had in his life, hundreds, but she refused to because she supposedly knew more. She was clueless and manic. She hadn't experienced them because she pawned it all on me. When I attempted to help and tell her what to do because he wasn't breathing and she wouldn't let me come over and help she blew up on me. I knew nothing. She's his mother she can do it. I have no idea what I'm talking about. She threw me to the ground and kicked me a couple time and kneed me in my ribs really bad and told me to leave the room. It took absolutely everything I had not to hit her as hard as I possibly could. I should've. She stopped caring for David who still hadn't started breathing again and had turned purple to abuse and belittle me. I don't remember what I said but I told her ""if you want to let your son die to prove a point I won't stop you"" and went outside where I just lost it. I couldn't stop crying at all. She ended up having to call 911 and he almost died for something I could've fixed and she should've known if she had just been there for us. This was a year ago. Her abuse has never stopped. She never apologized for it. There was no real I'm sorry. All I received was something along the lines of ""I'm sorry but you just wouldn't shut up and I needed you out of the room"". Invalidated me. It was my fault. I couldn't say anything otherwise I was gaslighting her. There was no sorry. No ""I apologize but it was just a very stressful situation"" no ""I'm sorry but I was so scared I couldn't think straight"". Just I'm sorry it's your fault. She blamed me for making her life bad. She's the victim. Even today she's the victim. Im the one who brings violence into the home. I'm the one who yells. I'm the one who starts every fight. Everything I feel right now is is because of her and I can't even blame her. She made me try to kill myself and I can't blame her. I think there's something wrong with me.",15bqbwa,depression

67,07-28-2023,"I'm not sure if this is the best community for this so please redirect me if it would be better somewhere else... 

My brother (36M) was hit on his motorcycle by an RV and has a comminuted tibial plateau fracture and open fibula fracture. He just had his 2nd surgery to fixate with plates etc and they couldn't get a catheter and he had to be transferred to another hospital with a urologist there had to use a wire and a camera etc etc. Anyways, he has been in a lot of pain. He's very depressed and hopeless since then. 

He's had bad depressive episodes, nearly suicidal in the past even when things were going well, so I'm very concerned now. Nearly everything he loves that keeps him sane has been taken away. We moved to a small town and he's always felt isolated and unloved even though all my friends love him and support him even now. But he can't do things he's loves; he can't mountain bike, he can't play the drums, he can't drink. He doesn't have an outlet any more.

I've been his caretaker, we're best friends and I'm happy to be there for him. We can make each other laugh more than anyone else. And it's been hard to see him so dejected. He can't cook, can't do laundry, can't get up by himself. I'm just concerned about his mental health going through this. I don't know what to say or how to help. I'm worried about leaving his oxy with him at night honestly. He doesn't even want to take opiates but after his second surgery he's been so depressed, I'm worried about OD.

If anyone's gone through something similar, what was helpful? Any specific activities that helped keep you busy? Really any advice is appreciated. He's going to be nonweight breathing for at least 3 months. Probably 6 months before he can walk on his own. And i can only imagine what a hill that is to climb. I'm just feeling lost, like I can't do anything to help. I just want to be supportive and make things as good as I can, let him have as much independence as possible.

It was around 6:45pm, I was at home, bored. Normally, I would take a nap around this time because the way I treat my depression (please don't judge) is smoking cannabis all day everyday so that means lots of naps üòÖ. Today I wanted to go to the movies, I rarely go, maybe 1 time every 2-3 years, but last week I went to watch Oppenheimer (9/10) and had a great time so I said : fuck it lets see what they playing tonightüßê?! Decided to go see 'Talk to me' I wanted something to scare the shit out of me you know? To feel a lil aliveü§£ü§£. So I hopped on my ebike that I just bought a couple weeks ago and since I got it, each time I go somewhere with it, I try to go on Google maps and streetview to verify if there's potential places to lock my bike, like in front of a busy business, or where there's people passing through,etc. I did found a spot,so its live ! Arrived at the bicycle rack, it was 70% occupied, but managed to lock my bike, perfect üòé. Went to see the movie.....shit was super corny and was not scary at all plus there was 3 kids to my left that didnt want to shut the fuck up üò´. Anyways, after the movie I went back to the bike rack and there was 0 bikesüò≠üò≠ I thought naaah maybe its like the angle of how im walking and im not seeing correctly, maybe i'll see it correctly when i'm closer...Then I was in front of the empty bike rack, and my U-lock was on the ground cut in half...I picked it up and looked around, I was sad af.

The anxiety part has been the worst, I have a stream of endless though going through my head non stop, about the future, past, things I heard a colleague say (and think it's about me) - I overthink EVERYTHING.

I have been on several different anti depressants which seem to work for the OCD but the anxiety (stream of intrusive thoughts etc) has not stopped. Over that last few years this has lead me to heavy alcoholism to ""Dull"" my brain and have some peace and quiet.  
  
I was recently referred to a psychiatrist again by my GP after a particularly bad alcohol session that left me in hospital. I spent a good hour and half with the psychiatrist describing everything.

I had problems with substance abuse and drinking, during the relationship and after. He had manic episodes and would explode, take drugs, be wreckless, getting into fights and dangerous situations with crackheads and pressure me to join, I‚Äôd already gained his trust and was deep into the relationship so I was blinded from the red flags. I was working in a store, and started to lose interest and left, worked in the sauna left, worked in a restraunt eventually, the more I was with him the more I started to realise his values of me, none. He‚Äôd comment if I didn‚Äôt eat or if I did eat or how much I ate, if a lot to his standard he would call me a pig, we didn‚Äôt always have food so I didn‚Äôt always ask for food but I paid him rent and money for food too. I stopped loving food and got skinnier and skinnier, I feared food and felt sick near food, I ended up working with him because the pay is better and he got me the job plus I‚Äôd never go hungry.

 I didn‚Äôt have friends after I met him because he hated them. He hated my family and my family would avoid him at all costs, having to meet him was like stepping on a landline, if it wasn‚Äôt perfect he‚Äôd be angry, a little late? He‚Äôs angry, someone looked at him wrong, angry. If I went out it would be for his benefit, or nothing, and sometimes I‚Äôd go on a bus ride to get away from him, or when I got kicked out frequently. I stopped caring and refused to go to my parents as he‚Äôd go looking for me if he didn‚Äôt block me on social media.

I had a job lined up ready in another area. My friends helped me get clean from drugs and alcohol and talked me out of things when it got bad for me. I felt good that I was working even though I felt exhausted and sick and withdrawal from the drugs. I had cut down a lot and it was going well so I thought, until I find out we have a new boss who fires me. 

I fall back into depression, and relapsed, then cried for a long time in the Darkness of my room. For months I was up during the night listening to music and feeling sad isolated in fields and sleeping through the day at home.

Since then I have now got a kitten, I go out daily, I have people that text me call me and want to meet up, but I don‚Äôt want to meet because my anxiety is too high and I fear people a little. I feel sad because my confidence isn‚Äôt the same as it used to be.

98,07-28-2023,"I stopped talking to my friends and no one has reached out to me since. It's so quiet, and maybe it's better off this way. I should get comfortable with being alone after all. Like any luxury, if you can't afford the upkeep or be responsible then you shouldn't have them.

The push and pull of relationships would always tire me so. Loved ones asking more than what I'm able to provide, even if it's the bare minimum of etiquette and care. I'd love to exert myself to give them the world, but all I feel is numbness. I want them to have better.

I am not what they need. Countless years and repeating lessons of never improving. When do second chances run out? What do you even say when the same exact thing happens, again?

99,07-28-2023,"Hi everyone - I would love to hear from anyone that has suffered from depression or had a depressed partner - as I'm feeling very guilty / in shock and struggling to cope with my situation.

4 days ago my partner (29m) of 4 years (which has been a good relationship), revealed to me (31f) that he's been severely struggling with depression, that he's having doubts about our future together and wants to take a break (he's flown home for 2-3 weeks and we're having no contact).

He was a very happy, sociable and outgoing person when I first met him - then COVID hit (and we live in Singapore), so we we were isolated and away from family, which hit him hard. He also has an extremely stressful job (which he started just after we met), which always makes him stressed and tired.

Over the last 18 months he's been through quite a few traumatic events (huge family arguments, Mum going blind) and over the last 9 months, he's definitely seemed a bit depressed (loss of interest / enjoyment in seeing friends, doing activities, doing date nights, etc).

We've spoken about it a few times and he admitted he wasn't in a good place but then seemed fine / said he was ok and sometimes seemed like his old, happy self.

I'm now kicking myself for not picking up on more of the signs / pushing him more to speak about things or get help. I have a Diploma in Counselling (although that‚Äôs not my career) and like to think I'm a very astute / caring / thoughtful person - and I just can't believe I didn't realise how bad it was. I can't stop blaming myself for how things could be different (for him and for us) if I had picked up on this / tried to help him sooner and for how I might have made his depression worse (by not being more understanding).",15bm10n,depression

103,07-28-2023,"I (20m) have been dealing with mental health problems since middle school. I've been to several therapists, psychiatrists, and have been on more medication than I can count. At the moment my current psychiatrist has me on three antidepressants, I don't know the names and I can't be damned to get out of bed to look.

I attend a local community college, which I dread going to, as I feel it will get me nowhere, yet, ever since I was young, it has been drilled into my head that no college = no success in life. It feels like wilfully going to prison.

Trying to get a job has proven difficult. Everywhere I apply I have been denied, which I don't understand as I was a restock mentor for a local company, so I have tons of experience in said department. 

Video games, which I used to enjoy, I can't play anything for more than 20 minutes without just, getting off and laying into my pillow, attempting to cry out my emotions, but can't. I remember the last time I ever cried, it was September 21st, 2021, 2 years.

I don't have anyone to turn to right now either. My sister made an attempt on her life back in October of 2022, and since then all focus has been on her. I'm glad she's getting the help she needs but my parents seem to forget I'm there sometimes. I vented to my mom a small bit, she said to me ""I don't know what to do with you guys."" Which I understand, being a mother with 2 depressed children can't be easy. Then later my dad came into my room and said straight to my face ""don't bother your mother, she has enough to deal with as is."" Don't get me wrong, my parents are wonderful people, they just have trouble understanding the struggles. My dad's the ""when I was 13 I was working at KFC making $5 an hour"" or something along those lines.

That leads me to now, I'm scared of myself, scared of what I might do to myself. I've isolated myself from friends and family for a week now. What makes things even worse is things just keep piling up in such short notice. We don't know the condition of my grandmas lung cancer, my mom got into a minor car accident, neither parties were injured thankfully. My sister bought shady weed and stunk up the whole house. The pressure on my shoulders is piling and piling, and I don't know when I will collapse.

I've repeatedly stated I don't deserve the things I have. I got my mom's old car, a 2014 dodge charger R/T, and everytime I drive it, there's always that small voice in the back of my mind telling me ""you don't deserve this, what have you done to deserve this? Nothing, nothing at all.""

122,07-28-2023,"Hello
It's the first time that i post here (or even on reddit altogether) but i feel like it's time to speak up. My life has been pretty normal for the most part: i grew in a normal family, only child,with loving parents (sometimes very hard on me but i never doubted them) and in a relative quiet town. Sadly, i experienced many traumas in my life. My mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis many years before i was born and i only saw her in a wheelchair since i was born. She passed away when i was 13. That left a big hole in my heart. The high school years were difficult,with many highs and lows, but besides some minor bullying and friendzones, nothing major happened. After i finished high school in 2019, COVID hits and nothing was the same since then. Besides all the problems we all had with the pandemic, my father died in 2021 from  diabetes complication and i wasn't allowed to visit him in the hospital and only few people came to his funeral due to social distancing. This moment was the starting point that lead to the situation i'm in. The same year, things surprisingly improved and i was able to get back up on my feet: i was helped by a psychologist, i inherited the comics shop that was managed by my father (even though i needed help from my coworker because of inexperience) and i improved many relationships with many friends. Fast forward to the second part of 2022, and things started to fall apart completely: even though i matured as a person, business started to fall drastically, my coworker started to take advantage of me because of my insecurities, social anxiety and the fact that this isn''t my dream job. Talking behind my back started and right now i can't stand her anymore but i'm afraid to fire her. To add to this, many ""demons"" from my past came back to haunt me: my social anxiety is at an all time high, i'm always afraid of not having anything interesting to say, i live with my85 years old grandparents that are always depressed and i have very little relationships with my other relatives. On the positive sides, i have a lot of friends that are awesome and i can count on. Sadly, i always feel inferior to them: they are achieving what they want like having a degree, a good salary at their job or finding a romantic partner. Meanwhile, i found myself at 24 years old an orphan with a lot of traumas, social anxiety at an all time level, never kissed a girl or had a relationship and, to make matter worse, a shop that is falling apart with little money that i can gain. People that know me they always tell me that i'm a great person, that i'm lots of fun and always call.me to hang out but in my head, especcially when i'm home, i think to myself that i'm just cursed for life. As the years pass, the fear of losing friends and the ones i love keeps growing and the fact that,at my age, the experience that i never had when i was a kid or an high school student (in terms of relationship with the other sex or the moments that i missed with my parents) will always haunt me and stop my development and leave me behind others. I always try to keep a positive attitude, encourage others to not give up but it has been a long time since i slipped back into this deep depression (even though i don't always talk about this subject in public). Nothing is working right now and i feel like a weight to everybody and i always feel like i have to prove something to somebody to make them stay (or at least this is what my brains think).
The only things that keeps my sane and escaping reality are my friends,music, movies and sports

128,07-28-2023,"TLDR at the bottom 

Some background - I‚Äôm a 31 year old female and my boyfriend is 29. We‚Äôre both from the UK but live (and met) in Singapore. We‚Äôve been together for 4 years, have lived together for 2.5 years and got a dog 9 months ago. 

I think that we have a great relationship and align on all the important values. We do argue every now and then but we‚Äôre great at conflict resolution. We‚Äôve definitely become a better couple over the last 4 years, as we‚Äôve learnt how to navigate each others triggers / needs. 

I have a fear of abandonment (but I‚Äôve worked on this a lot) and he is a huge people pleaser (which he hasn‚Äôt worked on much). 

Some differences:
- I love living in Singapore and he doesn‚Äôt, but I am open to moving country 
- I love my career; he has an extremely high stress (but well-paying) job, which he doesn‚Äôt want to stay in it but doesn‚Äôt know what he wants to do 
- this is my 4th relationship but his 1st 

In the last 18 months he‚Äôs had some really tough experiences - like huge family arguments, his mum going blind (whilst going through a divorce), best friends leaving SG and other friends just being shit to him. 

For the last 9 months I‚Äôve definitely seen signs of him being depressed and he has had around 3 huge meltdowns. He‚Äôs usually very sociable (we both are) but he‚Äôs definitely been less interested in seeing people and doing things. But on the other hand, a lot of the time he has seemed fine and been a lot of fun. He saw a therapist for a bit but then stopped as they both agreed he seemed much better. 

2 months ago we went to see a couples counsellor (after a big argument that we both agreed could have been avoided) and we both said how amazing it was for us / had made the relationship even stronger.

Over the last few weeks, his work has been crazy (working until midnight most nights), which always impacts us / his social life, as he has less time and energy for date nights and seeing friends. This does affect me, but I ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with it, to be a supportive partner and things usually improve again once works quietens down. 

3 days ago, completely out of the blue, he told me that he‚Äôs really not in an good place and that a big part of that is because of us. He said he loves me so much but doesn‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôre making each other as happy as we could be and he doesn‚Äôt feel like he can give me the time/attention that I deserve (and that the rel has started to feel like a burden), which adds to his stress (perhaps because of the people pleasing). He also wonders if the relationship could be better (I‚Äôm his first gf, so he doesn‚Äôt realise how good we do have it - but I know I can‚Äôt convince him of that). 

He then broke down crying and eventually revealed that he has been in such a bad place for months - he‚Äôs had random breakdowns (which I‚Äôve known nothing about / he‚Äôs seemed fine when I‚Äôve seen him) and that he just rarely feels any happiness (even doing things he usually enjoys). 

He also said that he‚Äôs been having doubts about our future together - he wants to end up on his family farm in 10 years and he‚Äôs worried that I won‚Äôt like that lifestyle. He‚Äôs never really voiced these doubts to me. 

He said he wanted to fly home for a bit and for us to take a break (no contact), so he could have space to think. 

I am in complete shock - I‚Äôd been looking at engagement rings recently and I‚Äôm now alone in our house with no idea when he‚Äôs coming back. 

The main thing for me is that I just want him to get better/be happy and do whatever that takes (even if it does break my heart). 

But I‚Äôm also really struggling to handle the situation - we went from being in a great place (or so it seemed) to a no contact break (which I think is going to end in breaking up). 

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone that has been through a similar thing - whether you‚Äôve been the depressed partner (to help me understand what it‚Äôs been like from his side) or if you‚Äôve been on the receiving end. 

TLDR; found out that my boyfriend of 4 years (with whom I have a great relationship) has been severely depressed (but in denial), has been having doubts about our future and suddenly said he wants to take a break from the relationship.",15bjxto,depression

It‚Äôs a quote I can‚Äôt get of my mind because even tough you can go around and have fun with people doesn‚Äôt mean they actually like you as a friend. Nobody no the real me except myself. And the people who get around to know me just a bit are gonna leave right after. I try to self improve with working out and setting goals for myself. But I can‚Äôt stop to hate what I see in the mirror and I understand why nobody will ever love me romantically. The last person I thought actually liked me was just playing wirh my feelings. I can‚Äôt stop to think I‚Äôm not good enough as I am. What am I lacking? Mabye I just have a shit personality. 
I feel like I‚Äôm drowning and can‚Äôt seem to see the light right now. It gets darker for each day. I don‚Äôt know where im going with this. Just that I‚Äôm sorry mom and dad for not being the perfect son either. I have failed. I‚Äôm a failure. I fumbled everything up to this point in my life. I‚Äôm not suicidal or anything like that. Just disappointed in myself. Anyways, just wanted to share my thoughts",15bj91n,depression
132,07-28-2023,"For those of you who discontinued meds due to numbing or ‚Äúblunting‚Äù of emotions, how bad was it??? Some people claim it just makes emotions less intense or sort of dulls them down but for me it feels like complete loss of emotions/emotional reaction to things. And how long did it take you to recover the ability to feel both positive and negative emotions and or react to things after discontinuing meds???

134,07-28-2023,"It's isolating to be so full of emotions, to feel so intensely because everyone around you seems so dull. No one can reciprocate it. It leaves me feeling like I'll never be loved how I need to be. And then that turns into I don't deserve to be loved because maybe I'm just unlovable. That's why I haven't been my whole life.

135,07-28-2023,"I just want to preface this by saying I'm not sure if my situation is as serious as some others on this subreddit and I'm already planning to do therapy soon. so I'm sorry if this post seems pointless. 

I am at a point where I feel quite empty. I'm not sure what value I bring to the world. I have health issues and I'm failing at chasing my passions and the things I love. 

I've been struggling to get work in the role I wanted and right when I may have made progress I had a stroke and I'm still recovering almost a year later. I can't feel things as well as I used to, I lost 1/4 of my vision, my licence is suspended as a result  and I feel like I lost any remaining enthusiasm I had left. It already takes so much effort to just appear normal.

some people use a situation like this to work harder and not succumb to their circumstances but I feel like there's nothing left in the tank. 

objectively speaking, there's a lot to be thankful about. I'm alive and have a supportive family and some friends but I just didn't imagine my life would be this underwhelming. 

How do people do it? How do they get back up when life knocks them down? I know I'm not suicidal but I feel like I've got nothing in me to drive me forward. I just feel empty like nothing really matters anymore.",15biv6s,depression

140,07-28-2023,"Every single fucking day is the same. I wake up, I react passively to things that happen to me and then I clutch my pillow and try to fall asleep wishing I could cry or scream or die or do ANYTHING other than wake up and repeat the exact same day I had yesterday. People I know and love and who tolerate me move on with their lives, choosing higher and higher spots from which to leap from into the great unknown, and I can't even get up out of this dark water long enough to get a decent foothold, let alone make a half-assed jump. In this most recent retelling of the tragedy (starring me, myself and I, otherwise known as the unholy trinity), Icarus crashed and burned before he even got off the ground. 

Things happen to people and it doesn't even faze them, like it's so fucking easy. Sometimes I feel like my finish line is the start line everyone else leapt from, but the dark water is a bottomless well and I am powerless to fight the current. The clothes I wear are lined with self-loathing and my hands are tied behind my back with chains of paranoia and scepticism wound tightly together with a bow. I gift what air I have left to others, because it is wasted on me.

143,07-28-2023,"I'm 17 and depression is the ultimate vicious circle for me, I want to go to therapy but I just don't have the strength or will to do it. Also, first time I tried it which was way back when my problems started and it wasn't even depression at that time, the guy I went to seemed pretty chill but when I said I have suicidal thoughts at times he said basically that ""Thoughts are just impulses in our brains that we can't change and can only observe where they come from"" which was so out of touch I didn't come back there.

You see, at the time I was usually pretty ok except for few hour periods few times in a month where I basically felt even worse than now, when I have depression, and my thought procesu would change just dramatically into this negative worldview, but next day, I didn't even remember what I was thinking about and dismissed it as something that I shouldn't worry about because it's temporary.

My mom knew about this, but since I stopped going to that guy she thought I'm ok, and even after I told her I had that episode again, she said I should go back to therapy again but after that never said another word, like she just completely forgot it.

Fast forward a year, and I cut myself once. It didn't even help with my emotions, I just felt like I had to do it and never did it since. Another episode happened too, but it was different because for 2 hours straight I was thinking about killing someone (not gonna act on it, killing people is bad) I know for no reason and I couldn't stop until I fell asleep and I was terrified of myself after that. 

Some time after that I once got puking-level drunk and so I would sit outside talking to my best friend while sitting and staring into my vomit for hours on end (I couldn't get up bcs my head gets crazy dizzy when so intoxicated) and I made a decision to message my mom saying I have depression (she didn't know anything was happening for a whole year) when I was still drunk and feeling that I should tell her.

Which leads to another thing, relating to the post title. Since I became depressed, I become so closed in myself, I wont talk to anybody about my problems. Sure, I would talk a lot about that with my best friend but it took months for me to tell him I cut myself and him asking me if I had these episodes again.

When I told my mom I had depression I thought we're gonna work it out. But no. It's still the same. I wont do anything about it since I'm so closed off, and she wont do anything about it, since... Well I don't know why.

Anyways, all this leads to me being here, lying in my bed and staring at the way out, a balcony at the 4th floor which would cut all my problems short. It's so close, but so far at the same time. So far, because I would never do it since I have people who love and care about me but sometimes I wish I didn't have them just so I could finally slice my wrists and slowly fade away while listening to some music.

Well, that was a long vent, hope somebody reads it. Feel free to DM me or something, I feel I'm not gonna sleep a lot this night.",15bi1ab,depression
144,07-28-2023,"My mental health has been impacting my work for a while. I've been aware but tried to get away with it as best as I could. Today my manager pulled me into a meeting to talk about it, and I tried to stand my ground, but then he said ""I know something's wrong with you, this is not you"" and I started crying. Yet I didn't feel like saying ""I'm depressed, anxious and often suicidal""\* was a good enough, nor appropriate answer, so I made something up and lied through my teeth. I apparently deserve a damn Oscar so at least I bought myself some time.

I find it exhausting having to justify myself. I have had a tough life which has definitely impacted my mental health, but at the moment I live in a good city, have a good job, friends, I travel, etc, and that's all people see and they can't comprehend that the same person who went to a festival a couple of weeks ago and had genuine fun and joy during those days, also wanted to kill herself two months ago.  

So I'm depressed, dealing with anxiety, possible ADHD, suicidal ideation, trying to hang onto my job and my life as best as I can, and on top of everything, I feel like I haven't ""earned"" having this terrible mental health. OR, I feel like I earned it when I was going through Hell and back, but since I'm now back I should be f###ng grateful, you know?

I don't know what this post is for. I wanted to confess the first part, because it is eating at me that I lied at work so easily. The second part just flowed.

At best I can only talk if it's related to work or a 'task' and any informal/small talk is rocket science to me, I just don't know where to start or even how, I've tried doing all sorts of groups/clubs i.e DnD, sports, gaming, pubs and even chatting websites but It never works.

but ive given up the following is a copy and pasted note i wrote to myself reffering to myself in the third person it details everything I hate about me.
  
"" No woman will ever love you  
  
You are bad at kissing your first kiss said that and choose her best friend over you. She didn't even kiss you because she wanted you she was just doing it because it was a party. Not only that but she lost interest in you after a week proving just how unlovable and worthless you are. You had a perfect opportunity and you blew it because you're you.  
  
You've never even had sex and probably wouldn't know how to do it right even if you did. Throw those condoms in the trash you know damn well you're never gonna use them.  
  
You cant take care of yourself you are constantly depressed and constantly drive those around you away. You feel a constant need for affection but always seem to drive away those around you no matter how hard you try to do things right. You want love but at the same time don't want to take any risks to be hurt again.  
  
You're pathetic. You don't have any muscles and your arms are skinny your incredibly weak and your stomach is flabby. No girl would ever find you attractive. Everyone around you says that and anyone who says otherwise is just being nice so as to not hurt your feelings.  
  
There's a reason no girl has ever talked about you there's a reason no girl has ever truly wanted you there's a reason no girl wants you and it's you.  
  
Actually, sexual assaulters and people who've physically abused their partners have gotten with somebody before you have and what does that say about you? That somebody whos toxic and abusive gets in more relationships than you do?  
  
No girl ever gonna want you. Nobody will ever want you. You'll never be hugged again. You'll never be kissed again, you'll never feel someone else heartbeat or hold them close, and you'll never be loved You've tried so hard so desperately for anyone to love you and it's never worked and never will.  
  
You can't even stand the sight of people in relationships because you know they have what you've never had and never will.  
  
You want to die so badly but are too much of a coward to stick that shotgun in your mouth because you're scared of what comes after. What's on the other side of life? But at the same time, the thought of death both frightens and interests you.  
  
Your memories, your thoughts, everything that you are will be gone but then where do you go? Does all of that just disappear? It terrifies you but at the same time the thought of no more pain no more thinking about everything you are and everything you've been through all that negativity will just be erased. And what would you care anyway you wouldn't exist anymore so you wouldn't even feel it or care.""  
  
my first crush falsely accused me of sexual assault  
  
the next cut me off and tried to get her friends to harass me at work  
  
the 3rd i fucked up  
  
she said she didnt feel that way towards me and i told her thats fine  
  
i wanted to be friends i truly did but afterwards everytime we spoke i just got a knot feeling in my stomach  
  
so one day i texted her saying that she was a good loyal funny and great friend but it was too much and i would be cutting her off
  
the next day i realized my mistake and tried to fix it but she simply said ""its too late"" and proceeded to send me a whole paragraph of things she didnt like about me before blocking me  
  
i felt awful i truly felt sorry for what i did and i wanted to make it right but i cant and it eats me alive knowing that i cant she was my first kiss she was the first girl that showed genuine intrest in me and i ruined it  
  
i had a best friend who was friends with the girl i talked about above, i did everything for her i bought her plushies for her birthday, i took her both to prom and the school winter dance neither of which she had any other way to attend because she was homeschooled and i didnt want to go to either event myself but i still went so she could have a good time i got her her first job and supported her in every relationship she ever had even with those i hated, I tried to teach her to play guitar and what does she do?  
  
she refuses to help me at all with her best friend saying that the reason she doesnt want to help is because ""i like her too"" despite the fact ive never had a relationship meanwhile shes dated 3 guys in one year, she cuts me off just because her boyfriend hates me and says that she hates me behind my back then 2 hours later tries to call to apologize but then blocks me again. when i bring up everything ive done for her listed in the previous paragraph she just says ""well you didnt HAVE to do those things""

I told her I'd forgive her if she was willing to actually make a effort to do so she took this as ""oh so your saying I never put in any effort to begin with"" and blocked me again

She was the bestest friend I ever had she was the first person to cuddle me and when we did I started to shake because nobody had ever held me like that before. When I was shaking she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek in return I kissed her on the forehead. I loved her I called her my sister and she called me her brother and she does this to me.

My last birthday was my 21st. I had a deal with myself in highschool that if things didn't get better by my 21st birthday I would buy my first bottle of alcohol and mix it with some pills. My first bottle would be my last. 

But I never did it and the reason I never did it was because of my best friend. But she hurt me she hates me. She through me away like a piece of worthless trash and now I have nothing.

im tired of trying so hard for people i care about only for them to hurt me. im tired of doing everything i can to help others only for them to treat me like garbage. i dont want to want people anymore i just want to die nobody will ever love me anyway.

162,07-27-2023,"I've struggled with depression since I was 12 due to intense trauma. I moved out with a boyfriend and roommates when I was 18 but had to move back at 22 due to breaking up with my boyfriend who turned out to be abusive.
I'm 25 now and...I'm still here. I feel so shitty. I developed an alcohol dependence which made me spiral worse (2 days clean rn). I started getting therapy at the beginning of the year, too. I was working a part time job and had my real estate license, both of which I've quit over the summer because they made me feel so much worse. I'm looking for an easy job but I'm embarrassed that I'm starting from scratch when so many others seem to have their life figured out.

The thing I feel worst about rn is living at home...someone told me earlier today that I do not have my life together because I still live with my parents. It hurt. I know I don't have my life together...that's why I'm here. I live in a fast growing city and rent by myself is just ridiculous. I have a boyfriend and we have talked about moving in together but we haven't been exclusive long enough for me to feel comfortable making that jump yet. I also don't want to do anything until I have a somewhat decent job (never been interested in a career, tried it with real estate and HATED it). I just need the motivation to do anything. Getting sober was the first step.

164,07-27-2023,"I'm a 28M that has gone through hell in his twenties. My depression and anxiety started in college and looking back it was manageable. Instead I decided to take antidepressants which started my psych med journey up until where it is now. I've taken a laundry list of medications in the past 6 years and am on five meds right now. The combination of these medications isn't working at all and I actually want to withdraw off of all of them at this point.

My job situation is hopeless. Out of college I decided to accept an offer from a job that was not the right fit for me by any means. My judgement was completely off and I regret making that decision to this day. I somehow ended up working there for four years part of the reason being that my manager knew I had mental health issues so he didn't lay me off. I tried to switch jobs the whole time I was there but I was too depressed.

Finally in the fourth year I resorted to using a stimulant to help me work on my resume. I thought it was worth it since I believed the job was a big reason for my depression. Turns out abusing the stimulant made my mental health way worse. I ended up going to a psych ward and rehab last year. I had to move back home and am now living with my parents. I decided to quit my job after the psych ward and ended up being unemployed for a year and a half. My parents were on me to find a job and they pressured me into returning back to the same company.

So here I am on five medications working at the same company that gave me hell for four years. I barely function at my job and I work with customers even though I have severe social anxiety. I actually hope I get laid off. My goal is to get a new job and move to New York but theres two problems with that:

1. I don't even want to get a job in my current field. Working with customers sucks when you have social anxiety.
2. I can barely take care of myself. Won't be able to live independently.

Was actually living in NY before for 6 months but had to move back home because of my mental health issues. I've tried to manage my depression and anxiety but its at its worst now. Along with medication I've been in therapy for 6 years.

I'm bedridden right now and helpless. I'm also braindead and have no personality. Its at a point where when people talk to me I can barely give a response back. I need serious help. I have basically lost hope. I seriously dont see a way to get out of my situation and thats why everyday I struggle with thoughts of unaliving myself.

**TLDR,** I've had mental health issues for six years now and in the last year I've gone to a psych ward and rehab because of drug abuse. I quit my job but am now back at the same job because I need income. It's either quit again and stay at home living with parents or continue to work there even though it causes me severe stress and anxiety. I want to find a new job in a different field but I'm at such a low point mentally that I can barely take a shower. I'm hopeless to say the least.

167,07-27-2023,"Dear Jess,  
I was having a panic attack every time I stopped distracting myself, so I thought I‚Äôd write down my feelings, as saying them is most of the time too hard for me. It‚Äôs a big rant, my mind never stops thinking like this, it‚Äôs really painful.  
  
I can‚Äôt feel things anymore. Not, at least, the things I want to. The days are going by like a slurry of nothing, and I feel there is nothing inside me anymore. I do things I like, I create, I go on dates with a woman I love, and my brain logically goes, ‚ÄúYes, I like this‚Äù or ‚ÄúI love her‚Äù, everything happens as it should, except there is just nothing there. A shallow ping in a massive colorless ocean. A small alert, I am happy, then nothing. I don‚Äôt know why. I know this is a massive symptom of depression, but I can‚Äôt rationalize it. I love painting minis, drawing, video games, music, and when I engage with these activities, if I feel anything it‚Äôs like a copy of a copy of a copy of what things are supposed to be. I am becoming numb to all good things.  
	The dread, the feeling of impending death, of slow rot within me, is of course, far more acute and noticeable than ever. Every anxiety, every feeling of shit, every bad thing resounded through my head over and over. I can‚Äôt stop thinking. I used to use many different techniques to deal with thoughts like this, but now only distraction holds back the tide of fatalistic thoughts and anxieties, and just barely at that. If I let my mind rest for even a moment, let it refocus from a distraction, a wave of utter depression, rot and grey misery floods my mind. At work I just think of everything I‚Äôm missing, every second I‚Äôm doing something pointless, and being paid so little to waste too much of my finite life. It‚Äôs a current of misery. Focusing on positive things doesn‚Äôt work, positive things aren‚Äôt really positive anymore, they've all turned grey. Being realistic doesn‚Äôt really help, either, I feel extremely reasonable when I look at my life, who knows, but I seem to give things a general fair shake, and it doesn‚Äôt look good. When I look back on eight years of growth, it makes me too miserable to realize that the move was lateral. For every single step I took forward, I uncovered another shit problem in my goddamn failure of a brain. Realize life isn‚Äôt meaningless, turns out you hate yourself. Figure out not entirely hating yourself, realize that you need to cope with having a kink that made you hate yourself. Come to terms with your kink, realize that the relationship you love with your girlfriend might be torn apart by your dumb ass sexual desires, and that most likely you will never have someone you love and trust engage in your kink with you. After all that, I come crashing into the realization that for me, society, life, the reality of work, are all things that make me miserable. At the end of the day, I feel like I‚Äôm not compatible with this world. It is a cruel capitalist nightmare that punishes feeling things, and rewards cutthroat ignorance.   
	I‚Äôm painfully aware that many people make it work, and are happy, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem like that even is a possibility for me. I don‚Äôt have a spark within me, I‚Äôm empty. ‚ÄúMotivation‚Äù simply means doing what I need to do, I have no hopes, no major goals, anything I want to do doesn‚Äôt involve work, and life revolves around work. What is it, two thirds of all days are spent going to work? Forty hours a week, and let's not kid ourselves, between commutes, stress and the effort, it's not like the rest of the day is free and open. In order to enjoy things I want, and accomplish goals I want, I have to live in misery the majority of my life. I get the sinking feeling that while computer science interests me, the professional work will be miserable. Dull offices filled with mindless IT work, soulless companies dishing out software to meaningless companies that produce more meaningless software for other companies, a ring of empty nothing. I have no drive, no work ethic, no real goals. Nothing burns within me. Most of all, I don‚Äôt really care that it‚Äôs missing either. I am such a cynical loser that believing in almost anything feels inauthentic to a massive degree. Being genuine is hard for me, and I assume almost everything in my life is going to be miserable, or fail, or be a real nothing burger.   
	I don‚Äôt know. What moderate work I have put into life seems to give little to no reward. Going through school and college‚Ä¶ I never felt connected to any communities in school, never felt a burning passion for any subject, never looked forward to a specific job, or went too far above with what I had to do. I will say I did well, and I‚Äôm moderately clever. I mainly understood what I needed to, learned a bit and did it all right. I put some actual work into it. I feel nothing. What was I given? Almost nothing. Covid annihilated my college experience, and I‚Äôve been thrust into what seems to be a nightmare job market. Plus the cherry on top seems to be that my entire job pool is about to be decimated by AI. Fun. Eagle Scout was another hollow experience. I went through the motions, did everything right‚Ä¶ but looking back on it, I felt nothing. No pride, no accomplishment, I did the thing, an average thing. I‚Äôm so fucking tired of people saying it was so impressive, it really isn‚Äôt. The standard of what an Eagle Scout is has fallen. Again, no passion, just doing the thing I should be doing, not what I want to do. Other things I‚Äôve worked at, again, I feel no real reward, after it all, what is left, I sit here with few friends, most of which I am at a very shallow level with, I will lose all my college friends since I‚Äôm lazy and bad at communication, and I don‚Äôt honestly care that much. My job prospects seem to be severely limited for the first, what, five years, confined to misery, then maybe a chance at something not suicide inducing? Even a year seems too much.  
	Should. I live my life by should. Not that it's entirely bad, all the things I should do have landed me in a position that should, on paper, be good. A STEM degree, a loving girlfriend, no drug or health problems, a middle class life, intact family in a stable region, but the only thing I actually want or have any passion for on that list is my girlfriend. Everything I should do, work out, go to work, wake up, eat healthy, communicate with friends, go to school, get a good job, it‚Äôs all miserable to me, something I force myself to do. For most of life, I am forcing myself to live. I don‚Äôt really have any other option do I? What, stay inside, get fat, play video games, make bad art, half commit to new hobbies, paint minis, write derivative, poorly worded stories for D&D and walk my dog while designing video games, learning new music and reading sci-fi? Besides getting fat, these are all the things that bring joy to my life, and all of them are completely unnecessary, immaterial nothings. In order to do half of this, like I said, I have to live most of my life in misery. These things, unless done at a level I know I‚Äôm not capable of, or really, I have the energy or mental health for at this point, are not things that will keep me and those I love alive. Only the things I should do, keep me alive, and I hate them.  
	The last ember of passion, of true genuine good feelings is my girlfriend. I know, it‚Äôs bad if your relationship is the only good thing you have going, your girlfriend shouldn‚Äôt cure your mental illness, it's not that, I just love her, and love being with her. I hate myself for what I put her through, for being the person she fell in love with. I‚Äôm certainly not the worst, I do some good shit as a boyfriend, but how is she supposed to go through each day knowing her partner is feeling like‚Ä¶ well, everything I listed above. She can‚Äôt cure, or really help me get through this, so all she can do is stand by and watch. I am doing this to her.  
	What does it all mean at the end? What does the garbage fire of emotions lead to? I feel like I‚Äôm rotting. I am broken, limping through life, a corpse being dragged through the motions. The days seem to stretch on forever, then suddenly weeks are gone in an instant when I look back. I feel like my death is inevitable. Not like I‚Äôm going to kill myself, I‚Äôve never wanted to die, but just that I‚Äôm so miserable and nothing, that the world will simply wash me away as a function of nature. If I woke up tomorrow with the news I had a terminal disease, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd feel anything much at all. I already feel like I have an expiration date close by. I can‚Äôt imagine the future, the idea that I‚Äôll have to go through another week, month, year of living like this overwhelms me beyond recovery. If my mind shifts forward even a little, I descend into misery.   
	I get it, I know how bad it is, I know I have clinical depression, everything is just so old, so similar. It‚Äôs been this way for a while. Things get better. No they don‚Äôt. They change. Things have gotten much worse for me, especially since college. I would argue that my happiness hasn‚Äôt changed that much since high school, my misery just stems from different sources. What‚Äôs the point of getting better, there is no end. My life has been a deck of cards, each one revealing another misery to endure. I‚Äôm running out of energy. I‚Äôm tired, unmotivated, miserable, pessimistic, and I honestly don't care to change. They always say, you have to want to get better to get better. I‚Äôve just become indifferent. I am not opposed to getting better, it's just, I think I‚Äôve gone as far as I‚Äôll get.   
	Over and over I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm not going to kill myself, and I mean it, since I know how bad it all sounds, since I know how awful that would be for everyone, and I just don‚Äôt want to. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but suicide just isn‚Äôt really an option ever. I could never bring myself to do that to people around me, although it‚Äôs funny how one of the biggest motivations for me not killing myself besides the things I enjoy about life is that it‚Äôs just something I shouldn‚Äôt do. There it is again, should. Should.  
	I know I‚Äôm not special, I don‚Äôt expect anything to lift me out of this, or have any delusions about life, or how to get through it, or anything like that. I just sit here and have the overwhelming feeling that screams, ‚ÄúYour brain is so broken you cannot function in this world, and you have no good excuse‚Äù. My thoughts are filled with rot, disease, misery, self pity, and probably anything else horrid and boring you‚Äôd like to throw in. Most of all I‚Äôm overly dramatic and selfish. All about me.   
	There‚Äôs nothing to be done. What way out is there? Luck maybe, waiting for things to go better in my life. I‚Äôm really out of energy and motivation, I‚Äôm not really a go-getter or self improver, or at least, not anymore, that river of effort and energy is gone. If a truck hit me tomorrow, leaving me dying on the side of the road, I‚Äôd feel the same as going to work normally. It‚Äôs a wash of grey. I am an odd mistake of nature, fine hardware, mostly fine software, but some glitch, born with or acquired, has ruined the code, a massive runtime error.   
	I leave off that I get the feeling that this, all these emotions and trauma, are like radiation poisoning. After a certain point, there is no healing. Permanent damage to the DNA, your lifetime quota met. Even if things materially turn around, and I get a job I enjoy, I know from past depressive episodes, like radiation poisoning, it doesn‚Äôt just leave and heal. It hangs around, the geiger counter crackling softly in my mind. I can‚Äôt think quickly, or coherently, I don‚Äôt feel much anymore. It‚Äôs like my mind is irradiated from years of depression, irrecoverable. The damage is done. I hope the rest of my life is comfortable and pleasant, but hope is now a foreign concept, and my idiot cynic mind rejects it entirely. I‚Äôll keep going to work, rotting through life, a walking corpse, until the world finally recycles me.

I‚Äôve been depressed since I was 13 on and off, I‚Äôm in my early mid twenties now and nothing has changed, I have times where things feel okay and I genuinely start to believe that I‚Äôm not depressed but I fall right back into it just as hard.

I'm ok now but i feel like there's this numbness that's following me. Im constantly tired. I haven't been trully joyfull for how long?

Im 17 but really feel like a child. I don't kniw why nothing works for me. Everything that's supposed to make me happy just makes me sad, because i know it should make me happy but doesnt! I went to a huge museum that i wanted to go to the whole year and i wasn't even excited.

And the worst thing is religion. I started getting into religion and hoped it would be better, but ut isn't! Why does every god want to send my atheist parents to hell? I walk around knowing all the people around me will suffer forever and my thoughts are full of them squirming, begging and wishing they were dust. They're incased in thick rotting skin and they're eyes are but blue marbles. I beg God to not let this happen to me, but i know i will endup that way. But sometimes it's hard to force myself to love him knowung he will do this to the people i know. I hope he will forgive me.

Even if i left religion, depression would find a new way to me. It always does. I tried to build up discipline and mindfullness, but then it comes again and im incapable of discipline, all i have are selfloathing thoughts.

Im trying to build a bussiness with my friend, but im so lazy and incomsistent. I was getting good and consistent but then i changed.

So technically, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, as this is me finding a place to just share a perspective, thought and dilemma I face. 

I'm not going to lay bare all of my tedious share of tales of woe to begin this with, but sigh

I find myself in purgatory. 

It has been this way for years now. 

I just have no one. No family, no friends, no one. 

What I've learned is that people like us, tend to be very vulnerable to narcissicistic people. The funny thing is, everyone's just a tiny little human, conditioned and structured based on our environment. So at first, the people who seem to be sweet, devoted for whatever reason and seemingly so very obsessed or addicted to us, just as lonely and isolated not having anyone ""sensible"" or reasonable to talk with, are a solid choice. Harmless. Trustworthy. 

Then the overgrown children get what they want. 

Their mummy figure. 

And that's when it'll be like you're raising a teenager who, after all the neediness and ""love bombing"" and bringing out your maternal instincts to devote and commit yourself to them, suddenly, they behave like a spoiled child that finally got the toy they've always supposedly wanted the most forever. You'll be cast aside, as they'll look for more and different sources for that dopamine supply they're so addicted to. Be it from trauma, poor conditioning or just plain idiocy xD 

You're then taken for granted and all the respect that existed beforehand, the kindness, gentleness, suddenly are all gone and replaced with bigotry and dismissiveness, passive aggression and petty fight picking that doesn't even make sense, only to be followed by so much drama, crying and acting like a little boy needing consoling and cuddles afterwards like What the hell? xD 

This is only part of it all. Through this, we are further conditioned, unfortunately, only ""reinforcing"" what issues we've developed as a coping mechanism or survival instinct based response that we've gotten from childhood. 

So long story short, 

Today, I don't know anymore. 

I would certainly love female friends similar to the sisterhood I had back in my adolescence. 

But man or woman, or whoever it is, I simply no longer see why on god's green earth would anyone even want to be around me or spend time with me anymore. 

From my experience, the boys and men that approached me, no matter what they say in the beginning(I'm just looking for friends/I'm married so) tend to just be seeking dopamine supply in the most elaborate forms and perverse. 

There's this romanticising that I find inappropriate. 

So I just want female friends to relate with, but I don't necessarily want to wallow, either. 

Just someone to reason with. 

Like anyone else, from time to time, I get reminded of the injustice I've faced and how illogical they were due to some triggering encounters with a random something. So I naturally get a little consumed by it for a moment and need logic validated as it wasn't validated in the past. Instead I was diminished with zero respect, which honestly sounds funny, as there's also some voices or people who would say, ""respect is subjective; if you're not getting it from the person you're talking to, then you'll have to re-evaluate your selfworth and simply stop feeding the animals, because clearly if they can't even meet you halfway through logical diplomacy and maturity, then there's no point. You might as well be disrespecting yourself here, too, by feeding the beasts with no brain for reason. Clearly, you're worth more."" There's always the patronising and thoughtless ""oh, you haven't healed yet. Poor you. So pathetic and petty."" remarks that is irksome, when trauma responding to experiences that weren't resolved fairly in the past. Resolving it, or closure comes different ways. For the other party involved, they delusionally think they're always right and they've had their fill so they're unbothered, but for those who attempted to reason and face the other person with respect, reasoning and straightforward sincerity, there's only confusion, invalidation and literal Abuse. 

So really. 

I have no idea how to meet new people, make new friends, or anything to thrive as part of a social species that requires socialising for enrichment. 

I'm no fan of loud places, crowded places nor excessive drinkers. 

My focus on reasoning and calm makes people ask if I'm autistic which I'm not, and I find it extreme and arrogant/bold to suddenly jump into clinical diagnoses, as well as short sighted. 

So. 

Recreational activities and such perhaps. 

But the trouble is, 

When there are so many people who's always going to be better than me, be it bubblier and less exposed to the dark bits no one decent really finds alluring, Why me? 

This is a question I can't seem to stop asking when people stay in my life. 

Gather a hundred psychiatrists or individual people and many things can be listed down for causes; 

Same with one who is broad minded enough to see different facets and perspectives. 

A child that had felt no worth at all growing up, exposed to the ridiculousness and cruelty of superficial people just coming for surface level interest without actually seeing deeper and having any understanding of something concrete, yet again, another unfortunate ""need"" or something the 'patient' is depraved of. Consistency, substance & genuinity from others and loyalty. As well as reasoning. 

I don't feel encouraged to even reach out anymore to all these wires of people trying to socialise on such subreddits. 

The kind of low effort and idiotic, disrespectful messages are quite dejecting, and then there's one we take a chance on, but only end up being a disappointment, too, one way or another. 

So that, plus my not understanding why people would even want me if they do, or say they do, are the dilemmas I've been struggling with and what's been keeping from socialising again. 

Cos it feels redundant. 

I use the same old TV show to hear human voices other than my own and the occasional coworkers I don't even discuss anything other than work with. 

So here I am, letting this oddness out just as everyone else.

I guess having some insight from someone who perhaps could relate would be a blessing. 

Good night :)",15bbdr8,depression
199,07-27-2023,"Hi all, just posting to share my thoughts. I had a pretty bad depressive episode around 2016/17 that lead to me seeing a psychiatrist and being prescribed venlafaxine (Effexor). I got to about 375mg/ day at the height of the depression but over the years have slowly reduced dosage and for a few months I have been down to 37.5mg/ every 2nd day. 

These past few weeks especially I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve stopped enjoying my usual hobbies (warhammer/3D printing, video games) and have no desire to do anything. 

Eating has become tricky as I don‚Äôt have much appetite even when hungry- I find that I have to force myself to eat. 

Sleep has become a nightmare. I have sleep apnoea as well which is being managed but lately i can‚Äôt even fall and staying asleep along with heart palpitations and restless mind. 

Work is especially difficult as I‚Äôm usually somewhat chatty at work but now I just shut down socially around co workers. I can‚Äôt concentrate and find it hard to focus on tasks. Very anxious and racing mind. 

I did reach out to my brother and mum to let them know how I‚Äôm feeling as last time this happened I kept it all inside and caused my family  alot of pain. 

I‚Äôm really afraid of how the next few months will look but I‚Äôll definitely speak with my Dr soon about increasing my dose. I‚Äôm hoping that this episode will pass but my gut tells me the opposite. The worst part is probably the apathy but also the despair and helplessness.

Brief introduction. Always been a great student. Good grades even when I couldnt bother myself to try. Great results as student in most esteemed law uni in my shithole of a country .. withdrew because I simply could not care less. Recently broke up with my girlfriend of eight years because I felt she deserves better - someone with ambition, someone who would actually care about her besides sex. Nowadays I mostly sit on my ass at home or at my job's desk, do pushups, play league of legends and lay in my bed reading books of some old long dead farts from nineteenth century (looking at you mr Dostoevsky). I also write shittiest of shitty poetry (its declining quality being one of the reasons I hate my sorry ass for) that I'd rather burn than show to a living soul. I am alone and miserable even though I have a decent life and a hoard of awesome people that actually care about me (I am an ungrateful little cunt). I would love to write thrilling and entertaining stories for people to enjoy but I don't have the capacity to sit down and try and when I do the result is usually so damn dogshit I instantly feel like a failure.

Everything save for brief moments of joy is bland. Time flows fast so fast without me being able to properly grasp its priceless biddings for me to get up and actually achieve something. Because I do not know what and why should I be even aiming for. Nothing makes sense and the endless tide of self deprecating thoughts is becoming progressively more tiresome.

It was good at times but then I dropped down again. I can't enjoy anything, i dont get enjoyment from anything, I can't focus on anything and I am just tired all the time and too tired to do anything.

I have seeked help but I didnt get it after I moved to different city. They havent answered to me in months, and I made appointments before I moved. I feel so alone.

I have distanced myself from everyone. I can't help it. I just want help so I could work again and do my favorite things. I can't anymore. It seems no one is here to help me because i just cant get a therapist. I feel alone and sad and I just want to be normal and be able to work.

I might be lazy too but depression is big part of it. I dont use it as an excuse, i just feel like it takes too much of my energy and I cant make it go away. I have medication but it doesnt seem to work anymore. I have no doctors and I cant seemto get hold of anyone. I just want help. I want this feeling to end.

however...I have a medical disorder that makes normal sleep schedule kinda impossible as well as too much talking. I pass out from time to time, low perspectives in job and anything. kids are probably impossible and from my last post u might guess that im a magnet for katastrophys non stop.My life is so shit that I honestly dont want to pull anyone into the same situation, especially no one id love. I guess you see the problem.

So... I had an idea yesterday. My only option would be finding someone that also has a rough life, could tolerate my annoying personality, sleep disorder, seizures, other symptoms... natural catastrophs like tornados...

Its like trying to find a unicorn and only way I could come up with would be posting on Tinder ""Searching for someone who also has a shit life so we can have a shit life together""...

As the post says.. I am with her for 3 years.. after a year or so into the relationship.. due to her orthodox family.. she started getting depressed.. she wasn't ready to share those with anyone except me.. not even a psychiatrist.. and it is same till today.. I took her to see a psychiatrist but she wasn't at all co-operative, so the doctor told us to bring her back when she is ready to open up..
She is happy girl for everyone.. but for some reason only I get to see her painful stuff.. this is happening for the past 3 years.. I tried to help her all through it.. but one thing I always made sure i never enabled her depression.. I always made sure she knows it's a common clinical condition.. and getting treated is the best thing to do.. but she always saw that as a judgement from my side.. I stayed with her all through this only bcz I love her.. but this is getting too much of load for me.. my heart is pounding hard everytime I see her text.. I dont want to run away from her.. I truly love her.. and cannot share with her how much mental stress is happening to me because of her situation.. it will only stress her more.. 
What should I do.. how should I handle this.. I don't know.. I am planning on seeing a doctor myself.. but trying to do it in a secret is messing up more in my head..

I try my best to be kind and stay quiet so I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. Not really seeing a point for my existence. I think I was a big mistake by the universe. I even hate myself.",15b4uj4,depression
246,07-27-2023,"Maybe I am not understanding how to help myself or get better. I got to my therapist, and we have breakthroughs but that is all they are. I get a breakthrough and dwell on the actuality that it makes me depressed. I'm kind just saying hello and being stuck there. It's like you pass someone on the sidewalk and say hello/goodbye, walk past its done. In the case of depression, you stop at ""hello"" and just stare it in the face. 

I know I am depressed; I can recognize better than I have before (not perfect but used to never notice it was depression, I thought it was just me) and can use my toolbox of ways to help me get through it. It doesn't seem like enough, no matter how many mental health techniques you expose it doesn't seem to help. The repetition of these tools keeps getting pushed out of the way and it all ends the same.

&#x200B;

The same: Wake up, get through work, sit in my car about to leave for work and I get the feeling of a 50lb weighted blanket on me. This then results in a nap OR shame for not doing anything so I do a mundane task, say ""yay"" inside and then justify I did something so I can nap till my second job/ or till i wake up feeling useless or I sleep through the whole night.

&#x200B;

I can't nap every day for 2-4 hours. I'm young, I know I want to do stuff but then the cost is the same each day. Choosing between a responsible adult task before napping is very rocky in my life. I am in control but certain days that HEAVY body feeling is so hard to beat. The only way I beat it is to find the shame ill have for not doing it, so I sit uncomfortable with the ""Yay I'm doing this smile"" like I'm getting teeth pulled. But I'm not getting teeth pulled, I just am going to do art, or work on my acting. 

&#x200B;

Currently: I was diagnosed with PTSD, Depression and ADD. I am waiting for my new psychiatrist to review my paperwork that takes about 2-4 weeks. I went to my primary doctors today (he saw my official assessment before this appointment) and explained my toolbox, the napping, the difficulties and I was crying because I told him I know to be patient mental health is huge these days, so I know there's a waitlist. 

&#x200B;

I was just hoping for some kind of validation or kindness or I DONT EVEN KNOW. But this made me feel so helpless/sad.  He instead told me he isn't going to mess with my ADHD medicine (that's fine I never asked him to), he mentioned a few different anxiety medicine switches and I told him "" I appreciate that but we had tried those two he mentioned in the past and it didn't work so I don't want to switch to as non-working one for the sake of throwing my body off from the one I've been on for a while now. He chalked it up to just wait and be patient, he isn't going to switch up the medicine and the keep going to therapy. he said, ""if you have heart problems, I can't treat so you go to a cardiologist.""

&#x200B;

I was crying because my medicine didn't kick in yet and the water works will happen even if a pencil dropped. He saw I was upset and patted me on the shoulder twice and said to keep being patient it's the depression that is causing all this and to keep working at it.

&#x200B;

I think I am disappointed because I was hoping for more from him. I know that he can only do so much, but I think this felt like a business transaction more than a caring provider. 

&#x200B;

Either way this sparked me into a crying, emotional, weak, impossible, impatient mood. I have another month or so to go like this. I can do it. I had a weak moment today. It likes being told you're going home from prison from a crime you didn't commit and being told by the guard ""oh not today, they person for this department is on vacation for a month.""  I felt that strong emotion one would get in this situation.

&#x200B;

I'm okay now but wanted to share this to see if anyone understand this feeling, it helps to hear others share on here. I am a very isolated person and just post the last close person in my life this past month because of my own issues they won't understand unless they are inside of me. So im saving this fantastic human that was once in my life from my unexpected, raging self that surprised me after the moment is done. Just stay away from me basically, I'm trying to fix me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thank to those who read, who comment, who care and can understand. I appreciate you more than another internet stranger could appreciate another. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

ALSO: I know and recognize doctors/nurses that are giving everything they can even if they have their own limitations. I am a human that was frustrated by another human, so I am venting. I don't blame my primary or anything working medical staff because they are under their own system and rules, they can't bend for one person or me.

247,07-27-2023,"Hi. I'm 25M and have been disconnected/discontent with my life since 5 years ago. I have been self-sabotaging ever since and have not made a proper relationship with anyone for a while now.

Started with a very toxic ex of mine that made me feel obliged to stay in our relationship. She made me feel like I was to blame to our early relationship due to the fact that I hade to focus on college more than her.

3 years went by and we broke up for good. It felt good yet completely different at the same time. It felt like I was relapsing the thought of having her around me. I have been on 3 different relationships after our break-up and none of them felt like her's.

I had a completely different outlook and approach towards life that I would be unbothered by anything. I kept to myself with my emotions and this resulted to me being closed off from my friends, family, and lovers. I have lost so many amazing connections because I kept pushing them away when I feel the slightest inch of depression. I always felt like keeping them away from me would do them better. Technically, it would but, what about me?

Recently, I was able to connect with an amazing woman. She was beautiful, smart, and we had similar tastes in hobbies. You guessed it, I just pushed her away again. I had a feeling of discontent and the fear of 'I would eventually just hurt her'. So I did cut her from my life. She was fragile and I dropped her like glass.

I no longer consider myself as a human being. All I do most days now is do things alone. I'm completely okay with it but, the thought of doing it together with someone will always linger in the back of my mind. So yeah, my contradicting thoughts have become the death of me.",15b4t0s,depression
248,07-27-2023,"I have kind of realized that in the end, it is all about me. I have not been able to do anything for past 6 years. Were others frustrated with  me? Yes, did it affect their life? No. Did it affect my life? Yes. I regret taking that mental health break 6 years ago. It started with not doing anything useful, eating junk and staying in bed for maximum 2 weeks. Then, I could not get back even when I tried. At first I was just having fun. Then I just got lost in that fun and became unable to deal with anything that needs me to have any sort of discipline or commitment. I woke up everyday saying I will change today, went to bed at night hoping I won't wake up tomorrow.

I also recently heard he is leaving soon, I'm now thinking if I stayed would he have eventually left because I heard that after I left he became closed off, I was the one supporting him work-wise and with me leaving it was a shit show for everyone, and so he has decided to leave. If I stayed I would still have a place of work, an income and didn't need to go through these painful rejections. 

I just got rejected for a role that I have a lot of passion for - 3 interviews and 1 task (a task I was told about last min and had to spend my weekend on). To then be told the other candidate had more experience....why the fuck would you continue with me if I didn't have even more experience.

258,07-27-2023,"Been sober long enough that the words I think are possible to write down. 
Am I finally healing? 
The world‚Äôs glow seems a bit more lively lately. I don‚Äôt feel sick in more ways than one for now. Remains to be seen. 

I don‚Äôt hold the same resentment as I did. Now more true in contrast to previous feelings. Now it is of abstract understanding. Then it was temptation, with a tinge of guilt, in my own weakness in reaching out. Then it was hope that some part of me could accustom this new relationship. I fully employed many a minute to fantasizing a reality in which we could again foster mutual benefit in our newly resurrected friendship. 

Hollow. All hollow. 

I resent you less however I grow less fond of myself. I‚Äôm fine with the mental depression. Not with the depression that saps the muscle of energy and the bones of stability. For I feel responsible for the latter. As a man on my own I‚Äôve grown used to this. I don‚Äôt shun it, more I use it for incentive. 

I loved far too much than the situation called for. 

I trusted without a base of credibility. 

And worse yet‚Ä¶ I *continued* this when consistently made aware of my disposition. 

What self-hypnotic phrase is said to oneself that excuses and implores mistreatment? Love? 

Our conversations have been hollow. You don‚Äôt mention her. I don‚Äôt reveal myself. We zombie some reminder of shared interest. Rarely are you asked a specific of the day. Rarely do I offer a meaningful answer. Hollow. 

Waking up in the morning with the millisecond of love and security I felt with you still within grasp of my sleepy hands, I feel the inevitable drop in the chest. You‚Äôre not here. This has been true for a while, yet sleep pastes you to my soul.

Feeling pathetic, acting stoic and uncaring when I then proceed to send songs to you throughout the day. Knowing you‚Äôd never had ear for what my ears so continuously indulged. It seems now you‚Äôre more likely to show interest as a result of‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm guessing‚Ä¶ pity? I happily revel in your generosity. In what sense of normalcy I find a bit of peace. 

All the more, still hollow. 

I drink to numb the sorrow inextricably linked to the physical pain I now bear. Doctors don‚Äôt have an answer. I stopped looking. 

My stutter is back. So I‚Äôm short in my engagements and more friendly than previous. The weed seemingly less potent and less helpful in my attempts. Though more frequent in use. 

It was easier in this state to blame you. But I find myself more to blame. I loved you. You didn‚Äôt make me. You didn‚Äôt make me stay. You didn‚Äôt make me believe you. I *chose* to. 

I do not understand the world in which such a love is so damning. I do not understand how now I still play martyr to our dead love. 

How now I‚Äôm dying of heart ache. If only for a moment I am able to express so. How do you cure that of which your soul won‚Äôt heal?",15b32th,depression
259,07-27-2023,"I've been dealing with depression for 5 years now, i've had ups and downs and treating it, and haven't thought abt suicide for the last few years, until now. I'm losing faith in humanity and myself, i don't know why life wants to punish me. Just about 3 months ago, i got into my first relationship, i fell in love for the first time, only to find out that i was being used for sex and money, and that my lover had a fiance and was cheating on her with me. Before i could even recover from my first heartbreak, another guy comes into my life, i liked him, but only as a friend. A week later he tells me that he's been diagnosed with blood cancer. I've had doubts about wether he's telling the truth or just wants to manipulate me into being with him. So i was cautious but polite. I spend time with him, he cried many times to me, we talked about his diagnosis, he got ill in front of me, but refused for me to call an ambulance, or go to the hospital with me, and, refused to tell anyone else about his condition. So even though i didn't believe him 100%, i'm a compassionate person, so i tried to understand him and give him a benefit of the doubt. In the meantime, i took his virginity and he asked me to be his girlfriend, but i refused. Still we agreed on being friends. Trust issues kicked in and i asked him to send me a proof, which is rude, but i had an excuse for being a dick because i've been lied good before. I asked him to send me his medications, he refused at first, but then sent me a pic of them from google. His answers to my questions about treatment were vague and didn't make sense. I can't believe someone can be this evil, to fake cancer and go so far with a lie, just to use someone. I don't want to live in the world with people like this.

I am feeling stuck right now for various reasons . I am in a very complicated place and for that matter I‚Äôm very complicated as a person. If you see any of my other posts you‚Äôll see what goes on with me . Right now however I am recovering from hernia surgery so I‚Äôm off from work which is good to help me recover. The job I am currently in is a crap show because of the bad hours , and this has been true since 2020. I‚Äôm looking for another job with my job coach which has steady consistent hours so I have 2 days off in a row and a better schedule so after I get off work I still have time to do other things such as the gym, meeting people etc . Anyhow I used to take pride in a lot of things in my life . I was very healthy (vegaterian) , I worked out at the gym 3 days a week and ran the other days . I took pride in my appearance by keeping my hair short , shaving mostly everyday and I was always considered handsome , I‚Äôm tall 6‚Äô1 ,  blonde hair , brown eyes , people told me I looked like a (healthy fit Southern California guy) since I love the beach , tan etc . Anyway I suffer from depression and so working out and eating healthy and being social with people distracts me from depression and along with that I take medication. However since 2020 when my hours got bad at work due to Covid and working late , having no time for the gym , and having little time for social meetup groups . I have a few friends and we do meet but it‚Äôs not as often as I‚Äôd like . So from 2020 to early part of this year I started waning a bit in terms of my diet , my appearance and stopped shaving everyday , not getting haircuts every 5 weeks or so . My parents commented the last time they saw me a few weeks ago they noticed I don‚Äôt care as much about my appearance and they sort of encouraged me to go back to that .The funny thing is during Covid i was okay with some of the changes since I was so distracted at work and couldn‚Äôt really do anything anyways because of the restrictions. However I started getting back to my normal depression pre pandemic of ‚Äú I never have a girlfriend ‚Äú, ‚Äú I‚Äôm ugly ‚Äú , ‚Äú nothing going for me , ‚Äú everyone has a social life but me ‚Äú .  
My Confidence with women has never been good . As I said earlier and in earlier posts I was a cute kid . My parents even thought of sending pictures to model . Well it was for naught and that never happened. I lost my virginity late at 19. Weird thing is I had sex with this girl but I didn‚Äôt want to be her boyfriend, than I had no luck with women period between 19 and 21, and even experimented with gay men, because I grew up in San Francisco so it was available. Obviously men did nothing for me , but I wanted to see if I had other options because clearly I was terrible with women .fast forward I had sex only once with another older woman and than finally had a girlfriend at 25. However the relationship was mostly physical and o got cold feet because she wanted to marry me and I didn‚Äôt want to , since then I‚Äôve had no actual romantic relationship with a woman , I‚Äôve had friends with benefits very spread out from each other and with older women since but few and far between. I dated a girl briefly in 2019 but it went nowhere.  For years I tried to work on myself , be more confident, secure , be positive but when you have had the bad luck I‚Äôve had you sort of start to become bitter about romance .  

I have a very weird confidence issue . I can be confident when I‚Äôm not paying attention to the whole romance issue or when I‚Äôm photographing stuff as I am a photographer. But when it comes to asking an attractive woman out I feel very nervous , not so much about the rejection part but more because I feel like the woman thinks ‚Äú what kind of creep like that dares ask me out‚Äù. While I know that‚Äôs my depression talking it makes me nervous. It‚Äôs weird because I‚Äôm mostly an extrovert and people like me apparently because I do lots of social stuff in my job .  Yet certain new social situations I feel uncomfortable and maybe I just lack confidence. I particularly feel the most vulnerable when I‚Äôm out in public by myself and I see people my age who look ‚Äú together ‚Äú and I feel I‚Äôm not .  I sometimes feel I‚Äôm either looked at as ‚Äú ugly ‚Äú , ‚Äú asexual ‚Äú , ‚Äú gay‚Äù . Not that I‚Äôm homophobic I guess it‚Äôs flattering when gay guys hit on you , I just feel like I‚Äôm too ugly to be gay lol. I‚Äôm just wondering if my problem is that on the inside I‚Äôm just not confident, and even when I have moments of being distracted by photographing or doing things I enjoy , it‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm distracted but that by nature I‚Äôm just not confident. And yet on the outside I‚Äôm mostly upbeat , positive, try to look at the good . But I wonder if women can sense I‚Äôm not confident even if I pretend like everything is okay . I‚Äôm not at my best right now and I need to change the trajectory. 

I feel like because I‚Äôm autistic it holds me back , even though I don‚Äôt look ‚Äú stereotypically autistic ‚Äú, I feel like I‚Äôll never be confident. And even though I had moments in my life where women found me attractive, I wonder if there was something wrong with the women for finding me attractive.  I try to be positive, fake my confidence but I know at the end of the day I‚Äôm ‚Äú depressed and have confidence issues. 

I live in Los Angeles and I love it here, but I think unfortunately most attractive women here are looking for ‚Äú someone with money ‚Äú, ‚Äú Uber confidence ‚Äú and ‚Äúsomeone who can‚Äôt be real‚Äù. I just figured out at this point I have so much insecurity about myself that I would never share of course , but those women don‚Äôt find me attractive because I‚Äôm just not their type , or even looked at as attractive. 

I want to get back to a positive mindset but it‚Äôs hard when like me you have just had bad luck . And I blame myself for it and not women like some incel dickhead who hates women because he is sexist pig . I just think myself I tend to think the worse because I haven‚Äôt had good luck , so when people say ‚Äú just think positive ‚Äú well if it were that easy it would be wonderful but it‚Äôs not . I guess when I have a new job with better hours and more time I‚Äôll start back at the gym , eating healthy , try to be more social. I would like to meet a woman organically and be with someone who I can be myself around just as she can be with me . I worry that I‚Äôm looked at as asexual, and that when I start working out I‚Äôll get more compliments from gay men than straight women . I know I seem so self absorbed, I‚Äôm just feeling stuck and need to better myself . I try to do self examination and work on myself but I get very frustrated with myself.

Yet I have women in my life I work with who think highly of me , and some of my biggest advocates are women , so some women  seem to respect me .",15b2pcy,depression

266,07-27-2023,"Reality hit me hard these last weeks. It all started four years ago, I was 15. dad left, didn't leave a single penny for my mother, had to eat bread and rice, and could sometimes treat myself with some yogurt or soda if I had enough money.

That isn't the main issue, since even if I was broke, I think I still lived way better than tons of people in my situation. My biggest concern for the last couple of years, is that I'm VERY introverted. I've had the same friend group for 11 years now. They're all very social, friendly people, and they're always together, I'm the one that was left behind. They're always partying, having fun, and I didn't leave the house for about a month right now.

I knew from the start of the year, that it was going to be a rough one, because it's the year where I graduate from HS. HS was the place where I lived my damn utopia. Woke up happy in the morning, always with my friend group, all the teachers loved me, and I really did too, had fun every single day. And now this utopia is over. Real life is starting to take over. All my friends are leaving to study abroad, and I'm the only one left in this third world dumpster that I call my country.

Another thing is, that I was never really a big ""hitter"" with girls, I'm a picky bastard. But there's this girl, which I've loved for the past 2 years now, we've been close but only as friends. She rejected me about a month ago, told me she found me disgusting, and a bunch of horrible things. I never felt more impacted by words in my life, since the day she told me all of that.

Last thing is, I went to a birthday party, mine actually, that was shared with me, and my bestfriend, since we're born the same day. It was at his house. I tried to off myself at that party, got way too drunk, even if I didn't ever drink a drop of alcohol before. He knows about how I felt in my life for about a month or two now, and also knows I've tried to off myself before. He was crying, telling me that I was important for him, and that I was important to all of them, I felt good for once, felt that finally maybe the only people remaining in my life, will help me go through this, will care about me, the way I cared about them. I'd kill for these people, go to jail for these people, I'd do everything.

It's been a week now, saw him call twice, told me he'd never invite me to a party again, told me that I ruined the mood. Basically, it was all a bunch of BS.

So, now, I'm torn between a distorted family, lost pretty much the only friends I had, got rejected by the girl that I woke up in the morning for the last three years, and left the only place where I felt at peace. Which is school. I don't know what to do anymore. Please help.  


Edit :Felt like I needed to give out some more details,  I cry every single day, for hours, until I don't have any remaining tears, I also puke once or twice a day, sometimes I puke blood when I do it too much in the same day, I spent pretty much this last month, 10-15 hours a day in my bed, wondering how things would have turned out if I was different, if I played things differently.  I only see one way out of this. I drive every single night, wondering when I'll have the balls to test if the airbag can save me.",15b170t,depression
267,07-27-2023,"I have been thinking of asking for advice for quite a while now and I‚Äôve never been able to really put things into words. As a description of myself, I‚Äôm male 26, I suffer from social anxiety(diagnosed) and have been depressed the majority of my life. I believe this post is going to be quite long but I‚Äôll try shorten it as much as possible. 

The current issue I‚Äôm having is loneliness. I used to have a close friends group (close as in we‚Äôd meet up everyday and do shit) but they weren‚Äôt supportive nor did they enjoy the things I did. I did it just to be part of something. 2 years ago I decided to try focus on myself, that meant I wouldn‚Äôt drive an hour each way to meet up with them and that grew to them ghosting me ever since. Currently I‚Äôm 90% moved on but it still hurts that people you considered friends for over a decade will drop you as you can‚Äôt go out and play pool. I think my mistake was once telling them that one of my fears is stopping being friends with them and that would extend to the full group(which has happened now) 

So now 2 years on, I have lost a bit of weight, I saved up enough and bought my first property a couple months ago in the city my old friends live. But the whole reason to buy in the city was to enjoy that type of life and meet new people which hasn‚Äôt happened. So now I just go out for walks everyday around the city trying to keep the demons at bay. 

In the eyes of others I have achieved a lot yet it never matters, I‚Äôm 26, I‚Äôve travelled 15+ countries, I‚Äôve tried a LOT of different sports and activities and yet nothing has ever clicked. 

I have thought about suicide since I was a child but my brain still wants to keep going. Now it‚Äôs becoming a fear of what‚Äôs going to happen when my brain decides to finally call it quits. 

Currently Ive met a few new friends that we sometimes do some things on the weekend but I still feel like I‚Äôm repeating myself being the one who always try‚Äôs to organise or I feel bad if I want to meet up with someone.

I‚Äôve tried Meetup apps etc but when I get outside the event my social anxiety spikes and I never join in. There‚Äôs one person I‚Äôve met who seems to enjoy things I like but still feel guilty(maybe a different word is needed here) when opening a conversation as I don‚Äôt want to look needy. 

I definitely need some sort of therapy but I don‚Äôt even know where to start and I just really need to vent. 

Tldr: In the eyes of society I‚Äôve had a good life, but now with achieving the goal of buying a place I have nothing left to do. 

This post is probably missing a lot of in-depth info but I think it‚Äôs long enohgh.",15b16yi,depression
268,07-27-2023,"Every aspect of my life is going to hell and I'm paralyzed.

I called into worked for the 2nd time this week because my 13-year-old daughter continues to get in trouble and can't be trusted to be left alone. 

Besides that, I feel like I'm just DONE at my job.  I actually LOVED certain aspects of it, but it pays poverty wages and can have a ton of mental stress.  If I still let it, it would be a 60 hour workweek to keep up with everything. Every day before work this week I've broken down in tears and considered going to clean out my office and give my immediate notice.

Money issues are piling up.

I chronically smoke weed which gives me anxiety and makes me isolate myself.

Isolating myself....I've done this so much I have no friends left.  Zero.  Even more sad is that I work in a field where I should be highly social and have lots of contacts.

My parents have helped with my daughter (babysitting, expenses) tremendously over the years, but they continuously undermine her punishments.  My dad is very manipulative and definitely helps to create situations that cause chaos. Yesterday he arranged for my mom to pick up my daughter's friend in a town 30 miles away and never asked me.  She was in trouble for a major, major lie she told just the day before and wasn't supposed to be hanging around that friend, or really anyone for that matter.  I ended up making a 60 mile round trip to take the girl home and my dad being furious.  I'm broke as hell and can't afford the extra gas.  I can't stand the mental anguish of his consistent manipulations anymore, either.

Money...I have none.  I'm sick to fucking death of being so broke at my age.  I watch my friends take 4 vacations a year and buy new cars and furniture and houses.  I can't afford the simplest repairs to my home. I feel like an absolute fucking loser.

My home...my parents bought it for me and I have no business owning it.  I'm a single parent with no child support and the property is way beyond what I can handle. They've helped me out a ton financially and its given them a lot of control over my life.  And I also feel very guilty that I have these frustrations with them considering the financial and other support they have given me.  

I'm so frightened of pain or I would show myself out of this world in a heartbeat.

I've tried therapy dozens of times and it only succeeds in giving me a ton of financial stress.  

A few months ago it hit me that I have failed at life. It's a pretty sobering thought. I kept hope going for a long, long time.  I've been dealing with major depression most of my life.  I don't think I have any hope left, just fumes in the tank.

273,07-27-2023,"(23M) First of all I would like to make clear; I‚Äôm not here to seek compassion/sympathy, I‚Äôm just trying to fully explain my situation hoping to find voices of people that recognize my symptoms/side-effects and could hopefully point me in the right direction. I‚Äôm also crossposting on a few communities because that way I hope to reach the right people somewhere.

My situation: I‚Äôve been depressed for over 14 years, I‚Äôve had cognitive behavioral therapy for over 8 (non-consecutive) years. The anti-depressants I‚Äôve tried/been on are Citalopram, Mirtazapine, Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Duloxetine, Fluoxetine, Quetiapine and I‚Äôm currently on Nortriptyline. While some have been more effective than others, I‚Äôve never fully been able to recover from my depression. That‚Äôs also partly why my current psychiatrist has let me have ECT (electroconvulsive therapy).

After the first 11 unilateral treatments were unsuccessful we switched to bilateral treatments which I currently have received 31 of, bringing the total up to 42 treatments. Luckily I started to notice some positive effects of the bilateral treatments after the first few which is why we kept going. My depression started to relieve somewhat, bringing my suicidal tendencies down and making me more approachable and somewhat happier. This really helped me gain the confidence we were moving in the right direction and hopefully nearing the end of the treatments. Unfortunately as I received more and more treatments I noticed that, although my depression was getting lighter, my PTSD was getting worse and worse. I started having full-on panic attacks and anxiety attacks.

One particular thing I started to notice in my day-to-day life which is making me write this post, is that I‚Äôm having way too many (what I can only describe as) d√©j√† vu‚Äôs per day. To clarify: I‚Äôve had casual d√©j√† vu‚Äôs in the past just as anyone else, what I‚Äôm experiencing now however is totally different. Every single day, every single thing I‚Äôm going trough/experiencing is making my brain having me think I‚Äôve already experienced this. So what I‚Äôm saying is that every conversation I have and everything I see/hear is making my brain yell at myself that I‚Äôve already seen/heard it and it‚Äôs making my inner thoughts conclude I‚Äôm sort of ‚Äúreliving‚Äù my own life‚Ä¶

Let me be clear; I know that what I‚Äôm saying (that I‚Äôm reliving my own life) cannot be true and is impossible. I‚Äôm just saying my brain is constantly ringing a bell saying I‚Äôm having a d√©j√† vu. I‚Äôve obviously already asked both my psychologist and psychiatrist for help. Neither of them recognize this as being a side-effect of my medicines or the ECT treatments I‚Äôm receiving, nor do they know what the cause could be. Thanks in advance for having taken the time to read my story, I‚Äôm hoping to find people on here that recognize what I‚Äôm going through and/or could point me in the right direction find the cause and hopefully a solution.",15b08ov,depression

276,07-27-2023,"Everytime I leave my house I become a robot.  Its like I become aware that I'm actually inside my body just moving it, it's a little claustrophobic at times to think about, like I'm trapped and can't get out. My responses to people are very short answers, like an NPC, I have fixed responses and never stray. For obvious reasons it has effected me having meaningful connections. I have friends but everytime I hangout with them they feel so far away, same thing with any of my family members. My responses also come from a place of anxiety, I have a stutter and it flares up when I get nervous. So when someone asks me a question that isn't in my automated responses I get nervous, maybe it's more accurate to say I get a wave of anxiety. This anxiety doesn't help my stutter so I start to trip over my words, which causes more anxiety. Then I have to end the conversation quickly because if I keep talking I won't be able to get through a single word because I'm in this cycle of ""oh I'm stuttering, oh I'm getting nervous, oh my stuttering is getting worse because I'm stuttering, oh shit I'm getting bad anxiety, oh fuck, this anxiety is making my stutter worse!!"" It kinda sucks. Let me tell you, ending a conversation while picking words that you know you won't stutter on makes you look stupid. My automated responses though, I never stutter on so I just stick to those mainly because I practice talking and practice those responses but I can't practice every conversation that's impossible lol this also leads me back to not having any meaningful connections, or should I just say connections in general doesn't really have to be meaningful I guess idk.

I just don't want to feel alone anymore, I want my stutter to go away, I want this feeling of being a robot to go away. I want this dream like state I'm in to go away. Its really lonely lol 

(Also side note, alot of people are really understanding with my stutter, it's the pained expression they have on their face when I'm struggling to get the word out that sucks the most, makes me not want to talk ever again lol I've been on the otherside to and the pained expression is a natural response idk it's weird, I try and not do that but I also slip up)

279,07-27-2023,"Tw: emotional abuse and self harm

Tl;Dr: I'm really angry at my abusive narcissistic parents and I have no idea how to express this anger. How do I express my resentment in a way that doesn't harm myself? I can't stand the idea of them celebrating my successes so I'd rather self sabotage instead. How do I break from this cycle?

Longer story:
I have narcissistic parents. They're normal, high functioning individuals to the outside world, but have raised me with an incredible level of neglect. They pushed me to be a high achiever, praising me only for my academic successes and for showing signs of (fake) independence, all while neglecting my needs and even my health. On top of this neglect, when I was 11 they divorced and dragged me into a spiral of emotional abuse and manipulation that lasted until my early twenties when I started talking back to stop the manipulation. Despite the pain and the less than ideal support from them, I got two degrees and have a good job now. I am also at my lowest mentally though, im anxious, depressed, think about suicide often, despite therapy and meds. In all of this my parents are very sorry and preoccupied and want me to get better but still do not feel any remorse for what they've done - they've done their best.

But I'm obsessed by this thought: why should I even TRY to get better and give them the satisfaction of having a kid that is doing fine despite what they did? Why should I even keep my job? I'm just terrified and disgusted by the idea of them thinking ""well, we may have made some mistakes, but look at her, she's really well off, maybe we haven't done such a bad job after all"". I'd rather self sabotage than see their happy faces.

My therapist says 'well but this is YOUR life you can't throw it away because of this'. But yes, that's exactly what I want to do. I'm so angry at them that my brain starts thinking - if I were to become what they believe to be ""a failure"", maybe that would hurt them and give me some relief? 

All in all, I understand I have an unexpressed anger problem. But I really don't know HOW to show this anger or what to do differently than self sabotaging. 

I've tried going no contact for a bit, but that was hard because it felt like losing a parent, and that hurts. I've thought of shouting at them and insulting them but that feels stupid and useless. Every time I've tried to point out to my mom that she's a horrible person because of xyz things she's done (firmly but calmly, without insulting her) she just shrugged it off.

I knew I loved weed and even though my tolerance was so high I honestly barely got high I just couldn't stop even when I got sick and even when I started coughing blood. I know that is absolutely insane  and I wish I could say something to justify how stupid that is but I can't all my brain can think when I don't smoke is get high or kill yourself I honestly don't mind dying from weed because I know before it happens I would have lived a life that made me happy.it's the only thing in this world that helped with this feeling of emptiness it took me from a shitty c average software engineering major to one of the best in my year. As went from something I only saw my friends getting to something I got on multiple courses in a semster and I even had one of my papers published in a journal. I still remember when I accepted I would smoke weed daily I came back from a really long day at school I was barated pretty badly by my professor I  got to my room and started crying like a baby. I've been told many bad things like when I was 13 and my mom told me if she knew I would be like this she would have aborted me but even that shit didn't make me cry so it takes a lot for me to cry. I rolled one and smoked and it felt okay, actually better than okay I felt like I could take on the world. Now that my head is clear all that's left is this sense of worthlessness that I have felt since I was a kid. The fake smiling the constant thinking of ending my life. I honestly can't see any reason to keep going without it. I really hurt my mom when she found out Im really  trying to not do it again because I love my mother although we've had our ups and downs honestly that's an understatement my parents are really awful people the stories I could tell my gut tells me after all the shit they put me through no normal person would give a fuck about how they feel but I do love her a lot and never want to break her heart like that again or hear her crying like she did that day again. fuck my dad tho he got  really sick this year and went to india for treatment he never told anyone what was wrong but he spent 40k USD so I'm guessing cancer honestly when I came to that conclusion all I could think was karma is a bitch asshole burn your money and die fastrr.

I feel so ugly now,  I feel so dumb I feel like a waste of oxygen, I feel like I will never be loved, this feeling is bad it hurts in my chest I'm trying I really am I have been trying but what is the point of living life if I can't be happy. Everything just feels like a distraction so I don't just end my poor excuse of a life. Nothing is helping I know it's not withdrawal from the weed because it's way past that stage and I have had tolerance breaks and been in situations in the past where I couldn't smoke and I was cool with not smoking because I knew it wasn't forever but now that they want me to stop forever I just cant because I have nothing in my life to live for nothing comes close to helping with this hole in my chest that just keeps aching I have no one I'm alone and I was okay with that because I had my weed honestly just want to stop feeling like this Idk anymore honestly from everything I told you what do you think?

I dated him for a year and 5 months but we just broke up last week. I‚Äôve been trying to get him back but he‚Äôs not budging but he also kind of is? He keeps bringing up excuses on why he shouldn‚Äôt be with me, but at the same time blaming me for a lot of things.
Now, I tried talking to him and communicating with him but he never wanted to put in the effort. He blames me for being disloyal but I was not, I loved him and I didn‚Äôt wanna lose him.  
He tells me I‚Äôm probably meeting up with other people and if someone ever R*ped me I‚Äôd love it. 
He also says I‚Äôm a jerk to my mom but she‚Äôs not the best‚Ä¶
His biggest excuse is that he jerks off to my mom and tells me ‚Äúwhy would you want someone like me? That‚Äôs not normal, I‚Äôd rather be single if I‚Äôm gonna be a sexual deviant‚Äù

297,07-27-2023,"for the last 5 years i've been in an illusion of self pity and victim mentality, when i have hurt so many people.

why should i whine about people bullying me when i have bullied people myself if not more viciously, a boy who i made to be an outcast which i bullied and never let him play with us, a girl who i have made racist remarks torwards her and outcasted her, but turn tables, i ended up getting bullied and she became more liked, we even became friends but i couldn't forgive myself, a young boy, same age but small in stature, same thing different year, another girl because i wanted to be in a group of people, i'm such a coward.

why should i whine about not having good friends when i either don't appreciate or ruin it for my own ego, a friend i didn't keep in contact with, another who i have maliciously hurt even though he cared deeply for me, more people i don't keep in contact with, finding someone exactly like me, manipulative, abusive and exploitative and when he does something i don't like i dish out his dirty secrets in the class so everyone hates him, but in the end i'm just like him, more friends i don't appreciate or ruin because of my ego, when will i learn my lesson

why should i whine about not having love in my life when i hurt almost everyone who i had feelings for, a girl who rejected me who i went on to hurt even more because of my insecurity, another who wanted me, but i ended distancing myself because i was so insecure that it wasn't real which ended the relationship before it even started, decided i wanted to change even if a girl had a boyfriend i wasn't gonna ditch her, fast forward that happened, kept my promise, one day we were walking home and we were talking and she said that her and her boyfriend were having problems, then out of nowhere she said that she has a crush on me, i said ""what?"" and then she dismissed it like it was nothing, and like a coward i didn't bring it up, and that was the last time i talked to her, one time i did see her after like a year and she gave me a look of pure hatred, till this day i still regret not talking to her about it and saying how i truly felt, another girl i started to ignore because i knew it was going nowhere, another girl i used to walk with, i started ignoring her and her group, another girl i asked her out myself, she said she would think about it, then my friend told me she said yes and gave me her number.

 but i was already dating a girl that would change my life forever, (i'm a cunt) with shit like this, i don't deserve to be even looked at, this girl was my everything, i had nothing back then, no one made me slightly happy like her, but it just would not last, we both hurt each other pretty badly, but overall it was the most loving relationship i've ever been in, but sometimes it felt like we couldn't stay, and i tried every disgusting method i could think of so she wouldn't leave me, manipulating, lying, but one if not the most disgusting i said was that now that she's leaving me that i have nothing to live for, obviousely you can tell what i was implying, but after all of that we split up and i kinda went insane, i didn't sleep for 2 weeks straight, sometimes i would randomly cry like it was a tic.

but it doesn't end here, i start liking another girl, we started off more as friends, and then one day i tell her how i feel, she tells me she sees me as a friend, i agree, then ignores her the whole year, sometimes we would stare back at each other, and it was the most melancholic feeling of my life, after that i never loved anyone, i kinda started doing the meaningless sex equivalent of asking girls out until i gave up, it's funny, because i'm such an egotistical piece of shit that it took me 5 years to realize this.

&#x200B;

i don't think i have bad luck, i think i have good luck, but i have so many disgusting things that my bad karma is through the roof, i believe if you do something bad you pay for it double, and i guess that's how it is, it doesn't matter that i know i'm bad, i'm probably never gonna change, or maybe this is the start of a new chapter, but not really, i'm only going to be free when my karma is gone, i don't care if i'm young, many people end up broken because of people like me, or maybe i'm overvaluing myself.

Everything just is kind of bland now, and I‚Äôm left to be more bored.

317,07-27-2023,"Hey everyone,

Alt account because...idk, felt right I guess.

I'm not exactly sure what spurred me to write here today as opposed to any other. I've always felt like the people who love me don't actually love me; rather, they love the plans they have for me.

I wasn't allowed to choose the career I pursued because my parents told me I had to be in some form of medicine or they wouldn't support me during my college years. Of course, I could have, but as a 17 year old the concept was terrifying. Or at least that's what I would say if it wasn't just stupidity: I had a big scholarship so they weren't supporting me anyway. 

My older sibling didn't help either. They went through professional school and decided that it was the right path for me too.

But I've never been like my parents or my sibling. They're so money and respect driven. You need to make more money than you know what to do with so you don't have to stress about not having a job and you can retire early. You need to have a job where people hear what you are and are impressed. I get the merits of this ideology, but I simply don't subscribe to it.

So I spent my undergrad just swimming through it, thinking that it was just the step to the next thing. 

Well here's the next thing and it's awful. I'm a complete outsider in professional school. I'm not rich, I'm not poor, I'm not into sports, I don't watch much television. I just don't think like, or value the same things as my peers. I don't mean to say that I don't understand my future responsibilities in medicine. I have the moral compass to understand I need to be proficient for my future patients. I'm just saying that ""being a doctor"" Isn't alluring to me like it is to my colleagues.

And when I look back I realize that I ignored myself. I thought I would pick up on stuff like I always did. That even if I didn't care about it, I could become a doctor for the sake of avoiding drama. But that's not how it works. 

I think the way your brain works, what you find rewarding and stimulating, is far more important in selecting a career than simple dollar counts. Because even if the salary is higher, if you can't get there, you're  worse off. Not saying I should've gone to film school or something, I'm just saying that putting a cube in the circle hole is futile.

And now my father is dying. It makes me wonder, what was all of this for? I'm going to suffer as these 4 years deconstruct every aspect of my being and live the rest of my life in regret because I feared a man who was going to die before I was even done. Of course I didn't know that.

Why is a 10 year old asking himself in the middle of class who would miss him among his peers if he were to die. I'm not suicidal, but why have I asked myself this questions throughout the years. I do not struggle to socialize but I'm very picky of when I do and don't want to. Some people just give a certain energy I'm looking for. That's what I've learned to blame it on. Deep inside, it just feels like I'm fake. 

  
So what do I do whenever I felt down. I voiced my thoughts through the ""void"" called internet. Bad... and I mean BAD choice. Now everyone in my family is worried about me and it upsets me because I like to keep to myself and quite frankly they are the last people I want to have a ""talk"" with, I rather talk to the homeless guy downtown. However, I hate the idea of being conflicted, but I am. I'm not scared of being open, but of being categorized... limited. A part of me believes still believes that my potential is through the roof, but the reality is that I have SUCKED at almost eveything I've done in my life.   
From basketball, which I've played for years, I still can't call myself a good player, video games same thing, even when I started working at 16, if it wasn't because I was nice to the customers I would've surely been fired the first 2 weeks. But I tried so damn hard at everything I did. I grew up very insecure, having bucket teeth and wearing glasses my older brother was the opposite of me. Popular and definetly better looking with girlfriends for as long as I can remember. I have, generally, not had any luck with gyals. I'm not bad but I don't fit the player concept unlike my brother. I don't even like it to an extent because that really is simply not me. I'm what you would call a hopeless romantic. I've tried breaking from it though. I even downloaded Tinder for some time but ended up deleting it because I felt ashamed to be swiping left and right. It was one thing when I did it for jokes but when I started looking for results it started to get to me and I felt awful about what I was doing.  

  
I somehow feel numb and when it comes to relationships I always feel like an outlier, disconnected as in, this relationship means so much to me and you dont even know. I love to build relationships but I always realize that I end up just being the in-class friend. Like damn yesterday we had a really good conversation and you couldnt even give me a nod in the hall. I got pretty tired of the ""I didnt notice you"" excuses, which many I felt where lies. I wouldn't get invited to house parties or to the movies but I would see the same friendgroup I considered myself part of go without me. Everytime I've tried to start the event someone would have to cancel last minute and to hell with everything. 

  
One time it happened, I invited some friends to the movies, flake, fuck it I'll go alone. I felt empowered, I felt good, in a weird way I was happy until I got lumped with the family behind me while buying my popcorn and drink. At the time I laughed it off giving the current wave I was feeling, but when I got back to my car after the movie I felt so lonely and anxious for the rest of the day. However I don't need something like this to happen in order to feel that way. In fact that's how I feel most of my days and at nightime it heightens thus here I'm typing this. There used to be one person I could talk with about these sort of stuff but they aren't in my prescense anymore and I don't like talking about things like this over the phone. Wether its my fault or not *I stand alone at the end of the day.* 

I'm not medically diagnosed to say that I for sure suffer from deppression, bipolar disorder or any other mental illness and I don't mean to mock anyone going through any mental illness and I mean this with all of my heart. 

But at the very least, I know that, I'm not normal and it sucks. ",15arms5,depression

326,07-27-2023,"Ok soo here is a bit of backstory on me  
I'm a rising senior in highschool, I have a really nice boyfriend, life isn't really terrible on surface level. But, there's something .. wrong with me lol. I've turned to reddit for some advice and to see if anyone at all feels or has felt the same way.   
I have never been diagnosed with anything but I have always felt, or better yet, KNOWN I did not belong here. As a kid, I quite literally had 0 desires or dreams or anything. I just planned on killing myself and that was that. And I just thought that was ... normal?? until I realized it was not. I realized my freshman year of high school that.. I was not feeling normal feelings. So many of my friends were already planning out their future and I didn't even see a future as an OPTION. and I had. no. idea. why. I have like some trauma so its probs cuz of that but whatever. I just never tried anything. I also lie a lot about like a lot of stuff and idk why. I just dont know whats wrong with me or if i deserve to keep living cuz my parents dont believe in therapy so im kinda on my own. I like wanna have a good future ig but it just seems impossible i have terrible school grades, im so behind my peers, i just see no hope anymore, idk what to do. everyone just says its scary but itll be ok but idk what to do idk if im a good person idk how im gonna do it, i just wish  i was smart and good at something and didnt waste my youth being depressed and being a bad person i just wanna die tbh but i cant and im scared but not in the same way everyone else is cuz im p sure they know they gonna make it out alive and idk if i am or if i even wanna or deserve to and i just. dont know why im here or what to do .. so yeah:)",15arfnz,depression

328,07-27-2023,"I don't know why I feel so compelled to write this post - by that I mean I am not seeking sympathy so much as I may be seeking understanding... I have often read other people's posts here on Reddit expressing concern about a friend who suddenly ghosts them... Being that ghostly kind-of-friend, I suddenly felt an overwhelming drop in my spirit, becoming aware of what grief I may have caused for many of my old friends and family members... I feel truly sorry for being some type of silent observer as what-felt-like a river grew between us... It is not like I, or any old friend/family member had done anything to sabotage our relationship(s), however, it is without a question that I more often isolated than socialized throughout my entire life... In recent years, as stressful events occurred in my life, I further withdrew, depression, ADD, anxiety, PTSD have compounded my isolation to the point I feel quite estranged. That much I wish I could express, or somehow be made known so as to 'break that ice' which has frozen me still in my steps.. I am truly sorry for my despair and moments in which I felt helpless, I wish I could explain the strange pain that accompanies this helplessness, especially the strain of knowing when, how and in what ways I should be a better friend... when my friends or family go above and beyond with an act of kindness, even something small such as a forget-me-not card out of the blue, I am crippled as I recognize once again the vastness between that friend and I. To give an example, I had made a friend in high school who I ignored on some occasions to selfishly smoke pot or something. As time went on, we went our separate ways but I guess I made a decent enough impact on him because almost 10 years after I bump into him at a local festival, and he was furious, it was like hero vs anti-hero (if the subject being saved was friendship), the moment truly rocked my world because I've never known of someone who suddenly became irate at another person's 'going away' in life... but he let me know that I was in fact a selfish smot poking directionless loner and (well maybe he was on a manic trip of some sort, but he was kind of right, I smoked a lot of pot and carved out my own path in life, heck I almost forgot I ever attended a high school anyway) but the crazy kicker is- he tops it off by gloating about his wife,  in that moment he adds a cocky reminder that she was a high school crush of mine \*now as crazy as that shit is, what troubles me is that clearly whatever I didn't do also had significant consequences that it came to haunt me, in this case no longer spending time with this kid from high school, living life, etc.. would I be any better off had I remained friends with that guy, definitely not considering our impromptu reunion, however, the experience itself fucks with me still, like I often question well maybe I should have at least made SOME concrete friends, or kept some friendships strong(er) and consistent so that when I am met with such adversity I don't feel so terribly alone, but then again I often wonder- or this is just a part of depression and ADD, hyper-focusing on traumatic moments that I wish to associate/find meaning in so as to not repeat the trauma..

Forgive my repeating, but to re-phrase my point/what I am seeking feedback/wisdom regarding;

Is this just part of depression? Is this something I should just accept and move past to rebuild those old friendships? how do I begin to explain that some primal instinct in me consistently fires-off fight-or-flight signals even during situations I should be calm-cool-collected and enjoying my time? 

At times I also wonder if I am best on my own so not to trouble myself further with such madness/crazy thinking... other times I read shit on reddit and say hey I am not alone! and wondered if any of you out there have wisdom to share for my sob-story... do I try to make new friends and new family, leaving behind what I never kept up with? honestly I can say there will always be a handful of true life-long friends/family who truly know this of me, do not fault me for it but nevertheless I know they don't understand..

329,07-27-2023,"A few days ago, I was in my room and it‚Äôs pretty hot where I live sonI decided to let the door of my room open to let the cool air from the other rooms in since I don‚Äôt have AC, but with like some tall cardboard blocking the way so that my cats wouldn‚Äôt enter. After a few minutes I heard them scratching the cardboard and meowing because they wanted to come in but I ignored them but felt guilty because they were begging and it wasn‚Äôt that hot, just the other rooms were a little cooler than mine. I still decided to let it like that but ended up feeling too guilty do I removed the cardboard and closed my door so that they wouldn‚Äôt feel like I was teasing them, I felt compelled to go pet them to apologize (which I suppose is like a compulsion) but I was too tired and wanted to go to sleep, so I decided I would do it later. Later never really happened because my cats were often not really in the mood for pets or were sleeping most of the day, and as for myself I have been dealing with a severe crisis of OCD for like 2 months now so I really didn‚Äôt feel like doing any compulsion. But the fact I promised to do it eventually and that I feel guilty for teasing them in the first place doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.

Now the thing is it‚Äôs been days and I can‚Äôt do any of my hobbies in fear they‚Äôll become contaminated, for a lack of better words, as in if I engage with them I won‚Äôt be able to enjoy them anymore since it‚Äôll feel wrong for me partaking in them while not fuffiling my promose first. So it‚Äôs been days now where I wasn‚Äôt able to play video games, or watch what I want, I‚Äôm basically stuck.

The thing is more things like that keep piling up, like this morning I wanted to get a snack because I was hungry but one of my cat was sleeping in her bed which was right in front of the pantry and I moved it knowing it would wake her up but I figured I would pet her a bit later to make up for it knowing I had already another promise to fulfill, and I don‚Äôt why I did it because I‚Äôm just adding more pain to my pain by doing that.

It‚Äôs even more ironic that they probably don‚Äôt really care, that I‚Äôm probably doing that more for me than them (or maybe it‚Äôs wishful thinking), that I don‚Äôt have to abide by that stupid rule which doesn‚Äôt let me do anything until I fixed this, or that I‚Äôll probably end up forgetting ot stop caring about that if I force myself to engage in my hobbies again.

Understanding people becomes an enigmatic struggle, a maze of confusion and misinterpretations. Their emotions, motivations, and actions remain inscrutable, leaving me feeling isolated and unable to connect with the world around me.

The more I yearn for genuine connections, the more I am confronted with the stark reality of my alienation. It's as if I am an outsider looking in, forever separated from the warmth of human companionship.

I recognize that vulnerability only exposes the raw wounds of my isolation, inviting more pain and disappointment. Attempts to bridge the gap between us often lead to rejection and reinforce the idea that true understanding may never be within reach.

The emptiness persists, a constant reminder of the void within, and the inability to comprehend people deepens the chasm of loneliness. Life becomes a desolate journey, traversing through a landscape devoid of empathy and connection.

Accepting the complexity of human nature feels like an impossible task, as each interaction brings forth more confusion and disillusionment. The beauty of diversity and the richness of life are obscured by the relentless fog of emptiness.

I‚Äôm left wondering

*Where do I go from here?*

I am not suitable for socialization, even if I enjoy it. I cannot make healthy connections with people, I‚Äôm RUINING PEOPLE. I‚Äôve hurt people so much. I don‚Äôt want to die but that feels like an option. I‚Äôm reaching out here because i felt this was safe enough. I can‚Äôt go out in public. If i do, i keep it short. I can‚Äôt hold a job.

my dad had so many undiagnosed mental illnesses (and many red flags), and my mom had depression and was a very shy person. unfortunately i had to learn how to be a human from both of them, making me into the laughable failure of a person i am today.

And like I have nothing sorted out in terms of university and career path. And if I wanna move out (bc God am I deteriorating in this environment) I'm probably just gonna have to work my ass off just to afford it. 

I'm not excited about school or anything anymore, I don't know if I can handle that all, and if I'll even be able to produce my best work. I wanted to call a friend and talk about it but everyone's busy tonight and my family isn't who I want to open up to. On one hand, I know moving out, even if it's super hard and what not, would be a good first step towards some change (and ik something needs to change) but on the other hand I'm scared about making the wrong choice and I'm worried I'll do all that work, be stuck working my ass off to afford rent, only to not be happy.

 I just feel really pathetic and alone. I have all these things to figure out and just no answers. I told myself I'd live to see out the plans me and my friends made, and to finish my last assignment, and today I did it. I'm done with what I said I would wait for. And idk how I feel really.

It's been so long that I've been in this episode, and even longer that I've been dealing with some of these issues (toxic home has been whole life) and when it's been so long, it's hard to imagine that there could be actual long term/permanent good change. I'm also kinda sick today so that's also stressing me out.

I've done my best to be strong, and I just don't have anything left in me. I wish my life was better and happier. I wish things were different. I wish I could move out easily, I wish I had financial support from my parents in terms of my education and what not, bc that would be a relief. I wish I wasn't kept so under a thumb and what not,  but that's just the hand I've been dealt I guess.

360,07-27-2023,"Hey all, I made a ‚Äúthrowaway‚Äù account specifically to hide my identity. Hopefully that‚Äôs no problem here. This is gonna be a bunch of reading, sorry about that. I just need to get this off my chest cause every once in a while the sad and depressing feelings hit me like a truck. 

A little backstory: as the title says, I‚Äôve been bullied most of my life. From elementary all the way up to the end of highschool. The bullying was never physical, but always mental torture. I didn‚Äôt have a fixed group of bullies, no. The bullies would be different people each day. Even random people out on the street on the way home. I‚Äôve been called almost everything you can think of. It got so bad that at one point every ‚Äúweird‚Äù comment by a stranger felt like bullying to me. 

This has left a lasting impact on me all the way into adulthood. I‚Äôm 26 now and I cannot remember a time where I haven‚Äôt been insecure. I cannot make friends because of this. I got no social skills. I cannot keep a conversation going. All the smalltalk I do feels like a chore and tires me out because of it. It just does not come naturally to me cause I‚Äôve never had the chance to practice it in my childhood cause I was protecting myself from the bullies by hiding myself from the world. 

This in turn has led me to feeling lonely. I got some good friends. But I rarely hang out with them. My best friend lives in another country and I only see her once a year. 

I am insecure about my body and my face. I got a weak chin, which makes me feel like I‚Äôm below average in terms of looks. I feel like I‚Äôm a boring person cause I can‚Äôt keep a conversation interesting. I talk in a very monotone voice. I talk very quietly cause of the fact I‚Äôve hid myself for most of my life. And all these things combined make me feel like I‚Äôm a very boring friend. I‚Äôm not interesting to look at and I am not interesting to talk to. So why would people continue hanging out with me?

I‚Äôve tried getting out of this drag, but I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve tried things like going on holiday with strangers, but I worry too much about entertaining them and showing I‚Äôm worth it. I did end up getting amazing friends from it, but that‚Äôs not enough. I still am not the person I wished I was. 

Another insecurity is me being 26 and never having had a girlfriend or even done anything with a girl. I feel like I‚Äôm not seen. Which I can‚Äôt blame anyone but myself for. This however feeds my insecurity more. I‚Äôm ‚Äúwell past due‚Äù the age most people get their first experiences, and I couldn‚Äôt even do that. I‚Äôm deadly afraid of the rare day something might actually happen and they find out they‚Äôre my first. I‚Äôm invisible to women. For a short time I thought I might‚Äôve ended up dating my friend but I found out she didn‚Äôt like me the way I liked her. But in the end I am not even surprised. She‚Äôs literally out of my league in terms of looks and social skills. Yet another thing that feeds my insecurity. Even when I got a great friendship, trust and understanding with someone, they don‚Äôt get attracted to me. Probably cause of my looks but who knows?

I am just absolutely lost right now. I don‚Äôt know how to fix the consequences of 15+ years of daily bullying and I‚Äôd love some help before I one day completely lose my mind over the fact I might never date and lose this lonely feeling. Or never get a solid friend group with people that see me as more than what I am now. I want to get rid of these sudden depressive episodes.",15anac2,depression

364,07-27-2023,"So I (19F) am a fucking idiot. I finally went in to see my GP for the first time since I was fifteen with the intent to just get diagnosed, get on medication, and move on with my life for fuck's sake. When given the questionnaire, I severely downplayed the ""hurting yourself?"" and ""better off dead?"" questions because I really didn't want to be sent to the psych ward. I have a job and I can't take the time off to get that kind of treatment.

My mother's a doctor, and she comes home and complains about how she gets these patients that treat their appointments like therapy sessions. I was worried that my doctor would do the same, and I felt this incredible urge to just lie lie lie and keep the conversation so jokey and upbeat. I never mentioned anything about my history with self-harm or how I spend every drive to work wishing I was brave enough to finally swerve into oncoming traffic. 

Anyway, I didn't meet the criteria for depression, which left me at a loss. I've never felt so invalid in my life. I've spent nineteen years listening to my mother tell me that it's just a phase and that there's nothing wrong with me, just to have her words clinically approved. I wanted this diagnosis to prove her wrong and to finally become a functioning member of society, but it really just did the opposite. I've never felt worse. I've wanted to die since I was ten years old, so this sadness is basically my identity. To have it discredited makes me feel like I'm alone in this feeling and that I'm never going to get better, because well, there's nothing wrong with me.

I'm planning on taking a mixture of 45mg of dayvigo, 290mg melatonin, and whatever's left in my tylenol-3 bottle with as much rum and vodka as I can stomach. I'm doing this on a week where I have the house to myself, closer to the end of the week and in the bathtub so clean up is a little easier. What do you think my chances of survival are?

I‚Äôm battling postpartum depression and had my lowest point on Saturday where I overwhelmingly wanted to run away or hurt myself, either way abandoning my beautiful month old baby. Despite support from my husband and friends and a mental health nurse, nobody could be in my head and understand the overwhelming despair and distress and sleep deprivation I was feeling. My baby makes me feel panic instead of love and bonding which makes me ashamed. No amount of people telling me they‚Äôd been there through hard newborn days themselves was getting through to me. I just wanted it to end.

I started medication three days ago. I‚Äôve gotten some sleep. No it‚Äôs not magically better yet. But I‚Äôm prioritising taking some time each day that the baby sleeps, even if it‚Äôs only five minutes, to do something enjoyable including asking my husband to listen out for baby while I put my earbuds in and blast some music. And it really is therapeutic. 

Listening to songs like Lonely Day by System of a Down and Under the Bridge by Red Hot Chili Peppers. Not happy songs per se but ones that remind me that it is possible to endure the hardest day of your life and come out the other side, own that you suffered greatly and it‚Äôs a part of your experience.

I'm what you call ""big-boned,"" so naturally, I'm wide everywhere. Wide shoulders, wide chest, wide waist, wide hips, wide legs, wide feet, wide wrists and hands, hell I even have a wide face.

So today I turn 38 and I‚Äôm out back taking some birthday shots (crown) and smoking an infused joint. I worked 10 hours and got myself a haircut and beard all trimmed up.  Anyways I‚Äôve come to realize that my drinking/ being a workaholic is probably one of the main causes of my depression/ anxiety.  See for years I‚Äôve been telling myself that, oh it helps. But it just only helps me forget and never a solution.  And  I‚Äôve always been an addict and it‚Äôs embarrassing to me which cause a circle and makes me depressed.

The only time I don‚Äôt feel miserable is when I‚Äôm escaping into the internet and being absorbed in a mildly entertaining YouTube video or movie. Everything else I‚Äôve tried has failed and now I‚Äôve stopped trying. Taking breaks from the internet just makes me more depressed. Exercise didn‚Äôt help. Getting out into the world didn‚Äôt make me feel more confident. I don‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore and everything makes me anxious.

People tell depressed people that you have to do the ‚Äúhard work‚Äù to turn your life around but I don‚Äôt want to. There is no reason or purpose to and I can‚Äôt get myself to do any hard work because I‚Äôm too depressed. It‚Äôs like a catch-22 or whatever.

And in reality most people never reach any kind of dream job, there just isn‚Äôt enough of those dream jobs. Although that doesn‚Äôt matter much to me because I never had a dream job or direction.

I would spend hours and hours searching lists of jobs and degrees online and none of them ever appealed to me. I went to community college and took general courses to not worry my mom but that‚Äôs been over for quite a while now.

Now I worry so much about my future and how shit it will be with money troubles.

I‚Äôve never tried antidepressants but they can‚Äôt change my situation. They can‚Äôt make me WANT to spend the rest of my life grinding away at some shit job that I dislike. I can‚Äôt afford therapy or medication anyways. I can‚Äôt open up too much to family because they don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù mental health and think it‚Äôs all just about magical meds or ‚Äúchoosing to be happy‚Äù

Even back at my peak when I had plenty of friends, was doing good in school, had a few hobbies, and had some fantasies about my future‚Ä¶ I was empty. I would put on a mask and pretend to be someone I thought my friends would find interesting. Then I would leave my friends and just feel numb. Never even feeling like a person.

I can‚Äôt just ‚Äúchange my mindset‚Äù, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve found out a truth about my life and the world that I can‚Äôt come back from.

I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbe successful‚Äù or ‚Äúprove myself‚Äù or anything like that. I have nothing to prove to myself or others. There‚Äôs nothing I want to buy or achieve.

For a ""brief"" background, I am a single 32(M) living at home with my parents, I have ADD, depression (both have worsened, and seem to reach a new peak the longer I ""endure"" living at home. This is clearly the root of my problem(s), however, I must also own up to the fact that I haven't been consistent with my work/career/life decisions and thus my finances have been much like a roller coaster that wasn't completely built before I buckled in... let's just say I am just now coming to my best senses and I can see a quickly approaching ""drop off"" this ride (will I survive?) Pun intended, I should have been suspicious long ago as I realized I was the only one on this ride... \*my family and friends have all continued to live normal lives and grown mature where I have only immatured... Puns aside, what I mean is, I haven't held a job for longer than 6 years and am currently ""getting back into"" part time work by means of a paid training program as part of a pipe-dream effort of mine to try out a new career in a higher paying field of work (cybersecurity). Given the fact that I live at home, am struggling with ADD and depression I am beginning to question my performance at work and consequently am questioning whether or not I will ""feel fit"" in any job.. It is worth knowing before the pandemic I was a full-time teacher, post pandemic I faced numerous health concerns, a significant surgery, unemployment and personal setbacks before deciding ""why not try something new?"" Getting to my point; I am struggling with whether or not I should simply return to teaching as it was a full time job and then commit to working harder in the summer time to make up loose ends financially over the next few years... OR... continue to question my performance as a life-long student by embarking on this new career choice in cybersecurity... which is constantly evolving so thus being a lifelong student is part of the territory (not necessarily a ""bad thing"") 

Ultimately, as I mentioned, I have to get the heck out of my parents house. It is a living nightmare being here.  Perhaps for the first few years I was not as aware of the dramatic affect living with my parents had on me, however, at least in my case- after about 2 years I began to grow suspicious that my drinking was masking a whole lot under my skin... I sought a therapist and found respite in unpacking a hell of a lot of baggage I kept stored within, however, because I still have not yet taken considerable actionable steps to live independently I have to admit I am overwhelmed/exhausted and stressed out by all of this unpacked baggage... My therapist has suggested I 'tap into' that feeling and try to 'redirect it' to build momentum, 'get fired up' about moving out and living on my own, (forgive my cynicism) I am absolutely fired up the more I unpack and realize how much holds me back and keeps me from living independently... on the surface I may appear fully qualified and should-be-able to live on my own, however, years of accrued debt, personal setbacks etc etc leave me in kahoots.  I am on a waitlist for public housing/section 8, however, I have been on a waitlist for so long I often question if I have applied accurately and/or how I can follow up/who do I follow up with...  as I mentioned, I previously was a teacher, so I have also recently wondered if/how I could work on a campus/live on campus \*\*important to note I also have a dog I have not yet registered to be my service dog (still need to get him training and certification) I am sure I left out some other detail(s), however, if I hadn't already mentioned, I am feeling overwhelmed and fed up with this truman show life of mine...

I have been in depression in 2010 when I was just 16 years old. I had several reasons for that. After that I realised I suffered more because I didn‚Äôt express about my feelings to anyone. 

After that, I decided to express and thought it‚Äôs helping me. However over these years, it has made me being straight forward which ruined my relationships. Then I realised people who aren‚Äôt expressing their true feelings on the front are the ones loved by everyone even though they aren‚Äôt talking any good behind. 

I have realised I am destroying my relationships by expressing every time to everyone about what made me sad, angry, about my opinions which has majorly impacted my relationships. And now it seems like I am having problems with everyone around me. 

On this Sunday, I delivered a baby and going through a lot of pain. Which everyone doesn‚Äôt experience. Still women compares my pain with theirs and it hurts.

Too stupid to remember what he and the boss have told me three times, apparently.

I'm never going to get through college or get a good job because of how stupid and thoughtless I am. I don't even know why I try. It's not like I'm going to achieve that ""dream"" of mine to move to another country. I can't even see myself in 5 years, let alone growing old surrounded by a cool culture. Honestly, the only reason I keep going on about going there one day is just to placate myself and trick myself into thinking that I'll have a future and that I'm actually working towards something.

Every day is so, so gray... Even on days where I can see color in the world, I notice the bad feelings even more.

Occasionally after work, I'll go to a restaurant and have as much alcohol as I can drink. I once drank three beverages quickly and threw up when I got to my car. I'm trying to do that a little bit more as I'm hoping I'll damage my liver or something lol

411,07-26-2023,"I'm a 22 yo young adult now. I've only been to one session of psychiatrist when i was 20 and was prescribed with a medication that is used for major depression but my doctor said it was to help my lack of concentration. I was there because of a traumatic event that happened which I don't want to specify although this is kind of a throwaway account.

I've been dealing with depression since my early teens but I clearly remember that it has gotten bad when I was 15.

It's like I lived but havent really lived the last 7 years of my life. I didnt study for classes, didn't seriously practice for anything be it an instrument or a sport, didn't have girlfried nor tried to have one, didn't study for my college acceptance exams. 
So ultimately in my 4 years of highschool only thing I've done was learning a new language and listening to a lot of music.
I used to be a very bright student back when I was in middle school, I had goals and ambitions to make a career. Thanks to that I went to one of the top highschools in my country although I don't really know if I can count this as an accomplishment.

But from there on it just went downhill. After graduation I was accepted to a university with a full scholarship, which I quit after a year. Then I found a non meritt based scholarship in a european university and went there for a year in which I've barely read 10 pages of my books in total, lost my scholarship and quit once again. Returned back to my parents house in my hometown for a year to get myself together and back on track. But its the same again, I didn't do anything tho solve my problems.

At this point I was really pressed with depression for a long while. Having mood changes daily, overeating or not eating enough all the time, playing videogames and just wasting my time away.

Then I started talking with this girl. We knew each other but on a superficial level. This time when we met up, we just talked for hours and hours then we hooked up(don't kow if this is the right term, I'm not a native speaker). It was the first time I've had an intimate experience that is beyond friends. I got emotionally invested and although she was too. We couldn't have a relationship because she had personal reasons which I respected. But it really bummed me out because I really liked her. This one felt like ""wow something good is actually happening to me?"" in the beginning and the opposite at the end.

At this point I was thinking I had hit rock bottom. I was looking forward and saying to my self at least you'll take the college exam soon, get accepted to a college and get your life together. Well surpise surprise guess who fucked up in the exam? Yeah its mister fuckup a.k.a. me again.

Now here I am 22yo, no money, no job, no girl, no skill, multiple anxiety attacks daily.

I need to somehow get rid of this fucking depression or whatever it is that got me to this point because i feel like im paralysed, I cant function anymore. And depression is getting really heavy and very dark at this point.

And forgot to add the constant depressive episodes and stranded relations with every member in my family since the very beggining of all these.


TL,DR: My life started to suck in my early teens then I started to fuck everything up then it sucked more which sent me in a cyle of fuck ups and sucks. Now I've truly royally fucked my life up and dont know how to fix it

I think a lot of it has to do with physical symptoms and I‚Äôm curious if any of you have experienced this as well. 

These can be with or without low mood but it can definitely cause low mood too. Severe fatigue, generally feeling sick or feverish, stomach problems, random pains, and lack of executive functioning (this one is BAD).

I would think about what would happen if you died and how I would sit by your grave stone and talk about my day. I hate how I focused more on you than I did about me, trying to make sure you were alright and eating well and doing okay when I could barely get myself out of bed or eat. I hate that just like with my old best friend, I became too attached. I hate that I loved you more than anything else in the world, your calloused fingers brushing across my face and the heat that radiates from your body when you held me. You felt like a puzzle piece that perfected fit into my barley solved puzzle. But instead of trying to put together more peices I could only thing about yours. I hate how I would have done anything to keep you in my life, let you do anything you want. I hate how when you were mad I wanted to scream in your face to just punch me so you might feel better. I hate how you teased me for things I enjoyed when I would listen to you talk endlessly about random things and music and your other interests, cause I knew how much it meant to me for others to just shut up and listen. I hate how you knew the intro to this song I listened to a lot and would visibly get annoyed when I played it so I would skip it every time it came on out loud even though I really liked that song. I hate how after sex I would fold the blankets and set the bed, throw out the empty wrapper and would sometimes make you tea, and sit and hoped you would look at me a bit longer before you put your headphones back on. I hate how I couldn‚Äôt handle seeing you being affectionate with someone else. I hate how angry I would get when you two held each other right next to me and didn‚Äôt even acknowledge that I was there. I hate that I never listen to what I‚Äôm saying before I say it.

I hate how much I wanted to be alone with you, not even to have sex but just so we could hold each other and talk. I hate what my parents did to me, how much they shaped who I am today and how badly it affects me and people around me. I hate how you said that my expectations of you about sex were unreasonable, I HATE HATE HATE THAT YOU SAID THAT I do what you want during sex, going away, coming back, letting you choke me even if it hurts, and the one thing I asked was that you just stayed with me for just a bit longer when you were done, but no I say it‚Äôs cool and you run to the shower and I lay there feeling naked and alone, and I hate that you never understood that. I hate how you never said thank you, ‚Äúthanks for buying groceries‚Äù ‚Äúthanks for buying dinner‚Äù ‚Äúthanks for cleaning the floors‚Äù, just one thank you for anything. I hate how you always knew what to say when I was sad, when others were sad too, you always had the right words that helped things come into focus and seem less scary. I hate how I am convinced that I‚Äôm the worst person on the planet. I hate how much I fucking miss you, I missed you even when we were sitting next to eahcother.

417,07-26-2023,"I've been thinking about this for the past two days, but I think I should finally write about it and see if anyone else has had a similar experience. Two nights ago I was laying in bed crying because I just couldn't do it anymore. Life has been difficult lately, and I was at my breaking point. I've always had a lot of self doubt and anxiety, but recently it just got really bad and I couldn't do it anymore. So while I was in bed I prayed to God (something I don't typically do, as I'm not that religious or anything) and asked him if he could take me in my sleep, begging that he would just cut the thread I was hanging by and that everything would finally be over. That was the first time I really, *truly,* wished to die. As soon as I ended my prayer I couldn't breath and I was just gasping for air, something that has never happened before, particulary while simply laying in my bed. And a few seconds later my tears were completely dry, my throat was clear, and my nose wasn't stuffy anymore. On top of that, my thoughts of death suddenly disapeared. I checked my phone and the time was 11:11 pm.

im a mid 30's male living what most ppl would consider a good life. Obviously not knowing the details of my day to day life and pressures that have accumulated over the years. 

&#x200B;

I have been unable to find a therapist due to availability shortages and the sadness and anxiety i experience everyday weighs heavy on me. 

&#x200B;

I have a laundry list of thigns that contribute to me feeling this way and it feels like an uphill battle everyday. A sick mother that is unemployed but should be looking to retire but can't due to finances. I know this is common for most ppl on this earth and specially here in the United States. I have been trying to save money for her and helping her manage her finances which are small btu would go a long way in our home country. We live on opposite coasts and for various reasons we do not live on the same coast. 

&#x200B;

I have a teen daughter i finally got custody of after 10 years of hard fighting but has left her scarred due to the other parent's emotional and economical shortcomings. I show a strong side and provide her with what i believe are good life values and encourage her to do better everyday. I hide my pain in order to keep her on the climb to recovery of self image and guide her to learn in school and of life.  This weighs the heaviest on me. I feel terrible for not showing all of sadness with her but i do not want to burden her as she is shaping to be a good person and is leaving a lot of her bad behavior's behind.

As a Man i feel like a failure. Hardly any savings for my kids' college which she now wants to attend, which before she wanted nothing to do with. IRS now wants more money from me because well it's the IRS and they have total control over your right to transact and they chose to simply freeze one of my accounts leading to a large list of issues but I have access to other accounts while that gets resolved. Now with a lot of different views on Male and female I find very few ppl that can either understand how I was brought up and how i was taught to have a certain list of responsibilities as a man.  Mainly to be the provider, to not let others down, always keep your word, never show weakness, always lead.  Sometimes i feel like im drowning in problems that have complex solutions but eventually get resolved but it takes a piece of me every time. I feel weaker and like giving up ( not hurting myself ) but just disconnect from society be alone and reset. Maybe move elsewhere outside of this country. Its a feeling of desperation to get away. I have not done that or attempted to do it because well it takes money haha and I have responsibilities toward my daughter, my mother, and my girlfriends. She is great support and i share some of these things but eventually it all comes back and I have to go through the process of centering myself again and again and again. 

&#x200B;

My background is that I come from a Latin America country and have been here since i was 10. Monetarily poor, moved countless times with hours notice because we could not stay in the room my mother had rented and no longer could pay for. She has done so much to keep me alive as a single parent.  I am grateful for all I have and feel guilty complaining for the thigns I have access to. Not wealthy but just over the line of poverty. i feel enslaved. 

&#x200B;

I wish to share more, perhaps I will in another post. but at the very least i wanted to come to a community that might understand my short story and wanted to know if I was alone in experiences and feeling. 

&#x200B;

I Meditate multiple times a day to keep me as focused as possible but more often than not resulting in all of the feelings of sadness and anxiety rushing back all at once.

&#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read. Much love to everyone.

438,07-26-2023,"Hey, ever since my beloved dog was diagnosed with an illness about 2,5 months ago, my mental health has gotten completely out of control and I am just so heartbroken and started to question everything. I basically moved in back with my parents because living alone seems impossible atm and now we have started treatment for my dog which requires me to be in a different location for a month (which I will gladly do for him). 
But I just feel like I‚Äôm living in a parallel universe where nothing makes sense anymore. I don‚Äôt recognize myself when I look in the mirror. Nothing tastes good and I have lost over 10kg ever since the diagnosis.
I question my job choice - and want a change but don‚Äôt know which direction to take - I don‚Äôt know where to live after the treatment - I don‚Äôt know how and why to get up sometimes, it feels like my heart is breaking 100 times a day. I‚Äôve struggled with depression and anxiety for close to a decade but now I just feel like it‚Äôs the worst it‚Äôs ever been.

And I was riding a high of being proud of myself with all of my accomplishments until June when I failed a Spanish test I needed to get into a specific grad program. After that I just stopped being as productive you know. I‚Äôm supposed to move to Spain for school in a few weeks and i have no idea how I‚Äôm gonna do it. I have no money and I don‚Äôt want to rely on my family. Ive been applying for remote jobs like crazy but I haven‚Äôt heard anything. I know a lot of the money stress is my fault because I didn‚Äôt plan the right way but to be fair I haven‚Äôt had much guidance on this whole experience. I‚Äôve also been dating someone recently that my family really doesn‚Äôt fuck with because of things that happened in the past. This person has changed a lot and I‚Äôm willing to give them a second chance, even though we‚Äôre only seeing each other casually since I‚Äôll be leaving soon and neither of us have the space for anything more at this time.

451,07-26-2023,"I have been depressed for over a year but lately its been getting worse and worse and feel like I'm stuck in loop I cant break out of. I used have a good life before all this happened finished school and college with decent grades had a balanced social life. I was confident and always maintained a bit of carefree attitude. I was a normal guy enjoyed simpler things in life sports, music, gaming everything was fine.  
  
Things slowly started to change when I finished college couldn't land a job while my friends started to move on in their lives and here I was sitting at home. I would lie in bed all day doing nothing productive. This made me a mess felt like I wasn't good enough or somehow I don't deserve to live a good life. On top of that I had feelings for a girl she moved on from my life before I could even tell her how I really feel about her this made me breakdown. I would relive all the good memories with her and even started to fantasize on how things would be if i really told her how i felt about her. I would sometimes think that if she was still in my life I wouldn't have fallen into this darkness and she wouldn't have let me. She has always motivated me to be the best version of my life. When she came into my life I used to think i was basically indestructible cheesy as hell ik but I had this insane amount of confidence I was disciplined had a proper routine worked out and happy in general.   
  
When my life took a dark turn was when I was sitting at home all day doing nothing I was already depressed a bit couldn't focus on anything. I got addicted to porn I thought this was the only rewarding thing I had left. Soon it became the only thing I thought about first thing in the morning and last thing I did before sleep it took over my life completely. I started to mastrubate excessively and consumed crazy amounts of porn. If you don't know when you overuse/abuse porn you kind of get desensitized or OD on porn it led to porn escalation. Porn escalation is when you get bored of regular stuff you move onto more hardcore stuff I still stayed on the legal stuff but I was watching more disgusting stuff I never thought I would ever watch and did some horrendous shit. Which even led me to question my sexuality or can I even be with a girl after all this trauma. I still am attracted to girls and can mastrubate to straight stuff but the urge of having intercouse with a girl has gone. I have done a bit of research on these things many people have suffered lost families and lives going behind this and some people get it fixed overtime if they stay committed and quit watching this horror and recovered from years of this addiction this gave me hope as I've been in this mess for only months and I still can put my foot down and quit while I can before I get into a deeper mess I cannot come back from.   
  
As a result of all this I wanted to end my life cause I totally went beyond my morals and beliefs I never wanted to get out of bed every morning when I wake up I thought why did i wake up today. I am still stuck in a loop of how I went over the edge with this stuff but I regained some sense that I cannot end my life. I am heading toward recovery I don't know if I will ever be with a women my confidence is still shattered. I'm still young I'm trying to climb back hopefully things workout and I can walk with the confidence I once had. I know this a long post and English is not my first language sorry. Im mainly making this post as a cautionary for anyone who thinks turn to these kind of stuff when they are down.

453,07-26-2023,"I've been suicidal on and off for a very long time. This time it's perplexing. Here is what is happening: I met this girl on Hinge 4 years ago. We went on a date right after. I reached out to her on LinkedIn afterwards as I had deleted the Hinge app (was tired of it). She said that she didn't want a second date - she had to focus on work, life, education etc. I respectfully back off and then nothing happened for a year and a half. She reached out to me via LinkedIn and asked how I was doing (out of the blue). I responded but never heard from her. Then I reached out to her a year later (December 2022), and she said that she is married now. 

My suicidality stems from thinking that I should have put more effort when she reached out to me. Maybe I should have double texted her, or I should have posted pictures on LinkedIn of my amazing life and career to show her I was ""cool"" (stupid I know but please bear with me). My career was thriving (I was golfing with clients, traveling and speaking at conferences and what not). Maybe she would have been impressed by all that if I had posted more on LinkedIn (we're connected on LinkedIn). I know all this sounds crazy but I am having a hard time getting over it. I felt like she was a perfect person for me: same education, similar cultural background and so much more. I don't know why I keep falling in this loop of rumination. 

I need help. I need direction and a change of perspective to deal with it. This is negatively impacting my life and work. I have such a successful career and it seems like I' about to throw it all away because I cannot focus on work or manage my emotions.

454,07-26-2023,"Okay so here goes.
I apologise for it being a long story!

My girlfriend of two years is suffering with depression and had been for around 3 years before we got together. Her ex was a drug user, had been abusive at least once with her and so her depression worsened terribly. We got together and everything  was great. She was loving and caring, couldn't live without me. 

We went on a cruise in 2022 and she struggled massively with her depression even though she had family with her. She was acting up, acting childish. We came home and I told her that we couldn't go on like we were and she needed to see the doctor for anti depressants. She obliged and they started her off on the meds. She changed for the better, having more confidence in herself etc. 

Things were still great until around November/December 2022 when we began discussing what was to happen is she was pregnant. A disagreement ensured about what would happen, things got out of hand and I mistakenly explained that I would leave her if that was to happen. Gruel, I know...people make mistakes. Xmas comes and she reveals she has booked us a holiday to spain, which was booked in october time. Anyways, february/march 1023 comes. Me, her and my friend go out for drinks in town (she has anxiety about being out in our local town) and we get discussing the same issue. My friend sides with me and she can't handle the pressure, walks out and goes home crying. Now me putting this down to her just being bratty/me not caving in I stay out. The next day she says she was upset but that not to worry and we move on. 

Ever since that day things seem to go down hill. The effort she once put in just wasnt the same. She stopped wanting to come round my house as much, our conversation seemed to be more of a struggle. We'd be in bed and she'd be facing the other way. If we had a film on she'd be on her phone instead (I think her escape at the time). She now seemed to just want to drive around in her car (our town has limited activities and both of us being into cars that now also seemed like her release). At this point just before we're due to go away and she suggests that her meds are no longer working. She goes to the doctors and doesn't mention that she's away and they put her on a different medication.

June 2023-now she is the type of person who stresses herself since everything has to be perfect. So we go away and within the first few days she starts to snap at me. Being at a theme park we'd be waiting in the line for a ride, if i touched her you'd think I wasnt even there. She'd be on her phone messaging a lad who she insisted was just her friend who also drives around town. Bearing in mind she is a very friendly lass who enjoys speaking to people and making friends with a range of people, I think no more of this. The trust between both of us has always been at 110%. A few other things happen while we're there including me losing my temper at her, and I tell her the truth about how I feel once we get home. 

Present- it's at this point after the holiday that things really get bad. Our conversation pretty much dies. We only speak and see each other about trying to work things out, what's wrong and what not. We get to the point where she says she can't make herself happy, nevermind make me happy and that she can't commit to a relationship anymore. She paid a visit to the doctor who has put her back on her old medication however any attempt to try and help her and she just repeats that she needs time to herself and that she is trying to be independent (she has been wrapped in cotton wool by her family). Now I'll admit it's been hard to leave her to herself, I've pushed abit too much to help her when she's told me to give her time and now we've argued. We've made peace with what we've argued about and I have told her that I will definitely give her the space she needs to get herself better. She has a block on talking to anyone about any of her feelings, especially me. 

If there's anyone who has been in the same situation as me or who is knowledgeable about depression and partners with depression that can provide some advice that would be great. I realise that this is a very specific situation with the driving around in her car, the baby disagreement was a big issue which we have discussed. She says she wants a future with me but she needs to get herself sorted before she commits herself to me again. The biggest worry that is she has done a complete U-turn on how she felt and acts towards me. She seems to not want to put any effort in to fix things but I do realise it's not as easy as that for her.

457,07-26-2023,"this idea that you don‚Äôt need anyone or that you shouldn‚Äôt depend on anyone externally for your own contentment and fulfillment is a very ignorant and dangerous philosophy to apply to life. this line of thinking is both impractical and delusional. it sounds good in theory, but in practice it‚Äôs nonsense. 

people are meant to and for love, and there is no greater purpose to existence than this. love of all kinds fall into this, but romantic love is the pinnacle of all meaning and purpose here. 

no one. no friend, family member, acquaintance, or stranger would ever be capable of loving, appreciating, perceiving, and learning of your existence on the same level that your person can. this is quite literally the ultimate fulfillment level in life. nothing can surpass being deeply known and appreciated by someone you love. 

if a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, does it make a sound? no. if you‚Äôre an amazing person with amazing qualities that can only be fully understood and appreciated by someone that‚Äôs unfathomably close to you and in love with you, then do any of those things about you even matter if they exist in isolation, completely unknown and unused? no. 

the idea that we‚Äôre to force ourselves to be okay with or without that is ignorant. it‚Äôs coping, it‚Äôs confirmation bias, it‚Äôs delusion, it‚Äôs lying to yourself and to others. 

the fact that this belief is so commonly held does not make it true, quite the opposite. whether you see it or not, this concept is a massive net negative on the world. it causes us to take love lightly, abandon, act carelessly with it, ruin great things, and ultimately hurt people. those hurt people go on to hurt other people, kill themselves, live lives of misery, and so on. 

in order to believe this, you have to be able to convince yourself to be some degree of naive and malleable, or you have to be an avoidant, detached, cold-hearted person, which is nothing to be proud of and the only thing worth correcting. 

just because most people believe it, doesn‚Äôt make it true. most people don‚Äôt even take 5 minutes to really examine their opinions. it doesn‚Äôt take much digging to realize that the rationale behind that idea is a dead end derived from nothing more than a coping mechanism.",15aa1av,depression

*I'll write this down and leave it here forever, so if you think you are not a lucky guy or you are depressed, remember my story and be happy with your life.*

Back in the days when I was a six years old kid, I got severe asthma.  No one had any idea about what the fuck is happening to me. I couldn't run, couldn't play football, couldn't even ride a bike, or swim. My childhood was not like a normal kid. I was always fighting and couldn't sleep well in the spring.   
The kids made fun of me, laughed at me, and bullied me cuz I couldn't do well, but I was trying to play football even better than the others.  But any sport or sometimes walking was a nightmare to me.   
Time passed, and at the age of 14, I got Celiac. I couldn't eat wheat meals. In other words, you should have a gluten-free diet forever. I was always working out, even when I had asthma.   
As a kid, life was getting tough for me, and I didn't know why that was happening to me or what I could do to prevent all of this shit.  
After four years, I got psoriasis and vitiligo at the same time.   
‚ÄåBro, chill out. I found white patches on my cock and some red patches behind my head, I visited a dermatologist, and he was shocked. Two autoimmune diseases simultaneously are so fucking rare and uncommon. Now I couldn't stop my head from thinking about how shit I am, how unlucky I am, and why I should keep moving when I have to live like this. Honestly, I can't bear this anymore. My girlfriend left me forever. I got single and worked more on myself. I couldn't believe I got vitiligo either psoriasis. How can I live with all of these diseases? People will give up even with one of these shits.  
Two years later, I got Peptic ulcer disease.   
I completely lost my ego. I don't have any confidence to move, to start a business, to have a girlfriend, to make my life better.   
I don't believe you if you say it's gonna be alright  
I tried to be positive for a long time, but nothing good happened to me, so don't say anything like that.   
I'm tired bro, tired as fuck, I'm crying when I'm writing my story.  
I don't need pity.  


I think life is done for me, I'm tired of fighting with all of these diseases to try to have a fake smile, I'm tired of being a fake happy guy. There's no hope. There's no light for me.   
I just wanna lay down and stoppppppp this disaster   
Why can't I live like a normal boy?   
I can't even watch a movie with pleasure  
My soul is dead   
vitiligo was a headshot to me   
Enjoy your life if you don't have tons of auto-immune diseases or any other disease cuz you will be a dead man.   


Enjoy your life cuz I can't enjoy myself  


I hate myself, I hate myself cuz I can't keep moving, cuz I'm not normal.  Be happy if you are a healthy guy, please be happy if you are healthy

462,07-26-2023,"Me (18m) and my family (mom and dad) moved to our new house two years ago. It was all exciting and fun for the first two months but then we saw each other gradually becoming more aggressive towards each other and I started to show clear signs of declining mental health which they noticed in my behaviour and responses. 

My dad and mom started getting physically ill and take loads of medicine every single day. 
I neevr really fell that physically ill but mentally I was at my worst especially the year we entered this house. I started harming myself, talking unimaginable shit about others in my head and being really aggressive for small things towards my own parents. 

I evenr went through a phase of hurting myself out of guilt and stress and being suicidal. 

Idk why all this started. We were supposed to be living a better life in this house. A happya nd peaceful one, doing out own stuff and progressing in life. But life, not just mine but my whole family 's life went downhill in the path of health and happiness.",15a8qu9,depression
463,07-26-2023,"Living for yourself is hard when you hate yourself. There are small things here and there that are painful and take work, but you can do them anyways because they are worth it.
Having to go to work is painful and sucks but is ultimately worth it because of the money and not wanting to let someone else down. 
Going to school is tedious and stressful but is worth it for a job and not wanting to let your family down. 

I realized I could never really do things for myself, because I have always hated myself. 
So for the past 3 days when I needed to get out of bed so I could confront the things I needed to do for myself, I couldn‚Äôt. 

I stayed in a city I hate, all alone, with all my friends and family half a day away because I wanted to work on my career, my projects, my writing, my journalling. So I could learn how to meditate and cook and take care of myself. 

I‚Äôll have a small hump of time where I am doing it, and then just scramble back to my old habits. Its hard to do things for yourself when you don‚Äôt care about yourself. 

So I blamed the world, why isn‚Äôt there anyone to hug me and care for myself for me. After all that pain and suffering I went through, why do I have to pick up the pieces all by myself.
I want to be great, but I can barely be consistent. 

I don‚Äôt have much time till I am forced to move back to my family, and I am scared because I know I am not going to be the type of person I thought I would be when I go back. 

What I did realize is sometimes, its better to drop the expectation. I really expected myself by now to be out of my minimum wage job, be in a career I am actually passionate in, build out my projects, and be able to give my parents meaning in their life. 

But its like I never started 

How the time goes. 

I draw myself in because I am ashamed of my self. I ignored my family and friend past couple days because I just want to give up. 

I will never kill myself because I know what it would do to my depressed parents, but all I can think about is how I would do it. 

I cant give up though. I have to take care of myself for myself.  

Writing helps me do that, I have tried to journal but its messy and inconsistent. I thought maybe if I can‚Äôt write for myself, Ill write for strangers. 

I heard something that it takes 40 days to build a habit. But really I just want to see how far I get. Its ok to drop the expectations and see how far you get.
 
So everyday I will post something, just talking about my problems, thoughts and life in general. What I accomplished and what I hope to accomplish. 

I want to get consistent with writing, also with coding and mediation. 

Maybe I will be consistent, maybe Ill just spiral out like I‚Äôve always done. 

I just want to surprise myself.",15a8l83,depression
464,07-26-2023,"Hi everyone. After being able to keep myself above water for a long time, I am currently experiencing that I can't bring myself to do anything anymore after work and just want to sleep. For a long time, I was able to trick myself and at least do smaller things that I really enjoy (going out for a walk, doing little sports, watching a movie). I notice that in the last few weeks I missed the tipping point again, after which I don't feel like doing anything in the evenings anymore. Do you have any tips on how I can avoid sliding further into this phase?

Hello fellow Redditors,

I hope you are all doing well. I come seeking some advice on medication transitioning, particularly regarding Clomipramine and Moclobemide. Before I begin, I want to clarify that I'm not a medical professional, just someone seeking some insights from those who might have experienced similar situations.

Recently, I made the decision, in consultation with my healthcare provider, to wean off Clomipramine, an antidepressant that I have been taking for a while. Now, my doctor has recommended starting Moclobemide, another antidepressant, as an alternative treatment.

However, I forgot to ask my doctor about the recommended waiting period between stopping Clomipramine and starting Moclobemide. I understand that both of these medications work differently, and there might be interactions or adjustments needed.

So, I wanted to ask those of you who have gone through a similar medication transition:

1. How long did you wait after weaning off Clomipramine before starting Moclobemide?
2. Did you experience any side effects or complications during the transition process?
3. Were there any specific guidelines or precautions your doctor provided during the switch?

Of course, I will reach out to my healthcare provider again to seek professional advice, but I believe it's also essential to hear from people who have firsthand experience with these medications.

Thank you all for your time and support. I appreciate any input you can provide. Stay safe and take care!",15a6ws8,depression
472,07-26-2023,"So I‚Äôm going to be honest. I see no value to discuss pretty much everything in this world except 2 things only when things are going well) more on this later in this post). 

I want to be clear, while I value being in the physical presence of people, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to get any joy or engagement from people. 

The reason being isn‚Äôt the problem with the people I encounter, but the overall world all people are apart of. 

I just get no engagement or value whatsoever on how the world operates, therefore making any opinions people have about the world useless to me. I just don‚Äôt care to learn anything or want to learn anything because I see no value. 

I just don‚Äôt care about movies nowadays, hobbies nowadays,  tv shows nowadays, politics nowadays, sports nowadays (unless my teams are having a great season)  trips people go on nowadays, jobs we work at nowadays, what people buy or sell nowadays, history of the world, or basically just about any topic you can think of. None of these things do anything at all to peak my curiosity where I would want to learn more. 

Growing up I almost never experienced any disappointment with the things I loved in the past because everything was done flawless. I was in constant awe of professional wrestling because anything and everything that could happen did happen. There was blood, sex, unexpected wrestler returns, intense drama and promos, and pushing the boundary storylines. Now it‚Äôs nothing more than geek reality tv stars who can‚Äôt act as wrestlers and generate the level of drama and unexpected things that existed from the past. It‚Äôs nothing but stale storylines that do nothing for me. 

I felt the exact same way with baseball as a sport. When guys were juiced with steroids it was fun to watch teams knock out the starting pitcher in the 2nd inning scoring 13 runs or a team get an insane amount of hits by compiling hit after hit in a row. Now it‚Äôs homerun or we don‚Äôt score. That‚Äôs a waste of my time and I have no interest to discuss or watch strategy in baseball even though I understand it. I want high scoring games like the steroid era or baseball ceases to exist to me. 

Basketball is a waste of a time sport as well as I have no interest in my team (the Nets) having no hope at being a 1 or 2 seed in the eastern conference. Once they traded KD and Kyrie I no longer wanted to be associated with them or the NBA in any, way, shape, or form. Being anything less than a 1 or 2 seed is a waste of time regardless of a title or not being a 1 or 2 seed. 

Football is a waste of my time as well since my team winning only gives me enjoyment for once a week, which isn‚Äôt enough. 

Watching tv shows and movies from this era are like torture. It‚Äôs talk, talk, talk, and everything out of hundred of shows and movies  I‚Äôve ever tried makes me constantly think in my mind (when will this be over as I‚Äôm being tortured.)  I just don‚Äôt find the level of suspense or comedy in these things that I found growing up. There‚Äôs a lack of slapstick comedy and lack of suspense. Everything is just a waste of time. 

Overall I‚Äôm just a sad, internally angry, frustrated, and disappointed person. I hate society and feel betrayed by them a lot more now as opposed to growing up because I never had worry about accepting things. If I needed to get over my favorite team losing, I could rely on wrestling engaging me to do it. If I had to fulfill boredom of not seeing anything interesting with tv shows or movies in 2004, I could watch major hurricanes wreak havoc in 2004 (not that I was wishing damage or pain on people from destruction hurricanes cause because I‚Äôm not, but I‚Äôm engaged seeing ferocious winds and water). 

I just feel conversing with people in my life are a waste of time. I feel bad about it because I don‚Äôt hate the physical presence of people, I just don‚Äôt like anything about modern day aspects and would rather be a kid again. There‚Äôs nothing about the present gets me excited,  invested to talk about or would want to learn more about.",15a68ek,depression
473,07-26-2023,"I am completely broken now.

I wake up everyday with the same feeling of worthlessness and shame as I can‚Äôt find a job, get a driving license and lose motivation to go outside or go to the gym.

These emotions all stemming from one call I had with my now ex-girlfriend. For the past 3 months, I have been hit with the ‚Äògraduation low‚Äô knowing I was walking away with a degree in Performing Arts, a crippling amount of debt and little to no idea what to do about it. 

Unfortunately I had to stay at my accommodation until the tenancy ended in the beginning of July. During that time, my only form of socialising was with my then partner.

Over this time, The conversation of our futures would come up again and again, with me feeling very hopeless and wanting to find comfort as I could only bottle up my emotions as I didn‚Äôt want to upset her.

We go to Leeds for a pub crawl for one of her friends birthday unsurprisingly I broke down, ruining her night and everyone else‚Äôs.

The call we had this week, she stated that she was sorry but she said she needed space and wanted to focus on herself as she absolutely should do. 

I found it very hard to process and during the call without realising the implications of what had just transpired, i just said that it‚Äôs okay and did everything I could to make the process less heartbreaking for her. 

After the call, I wept like I never wept before, like a loved one had died. I took myself out for a walk during this call to get out of a claustrophobic space and I rushed back home, I went up to my parents to explain what just happened and my mum came down to comfort me, where I broke down completely, saying it was my fault for all of this and that I have nothing and will never find anything as genuine like that again.

Everyday since, I‚Äôve been having panic attacks and nightmares, waking up late in the day, sleeping late at night, mouth covered in canker sores including one on my Uvula which causing me pain while eating and drinking. 

I am waiting to hear back from a really good Theatre technician apprenticeship job which is the closest thing to knowing what I need as a career. I fear if I don‚Äôt get that job, then I‚Äôll be waiting for a long time for something better.

I want to prioritise my happiness and find my career but nothing present is giving me any hope of that and I fear I‚Äôll be stranded at my parents home like some caged asylum subject. 

I have difficulty making genuine human connections and I can‚Äôt afford to lose one‚Äôs which better me as a person, I do love myself and I know I have goals which I want to achieve. 

I don‚Äôt want to believe that I am not happy with myself, it‚Äôs a difficult stage in my life but it‚Äôs eased knowing I had someone who cared for me like no one else could.

475,07-26-2023,"Hi, I'm 32 years old female. Currently I live in Germany but I am from argentina.
I have depression since as long as I can remember.

My parents got divorced when I was 10 years old. The process was very violent. They always screamed at each other and hit each other. My brother and I had to witness it all.

My mother got in a relationship with a drug addict man, who sexually harassed me and touched me inappropriately for years.
My brother and I wanted that man out of the house, but my mother lived for him. I never had the courage to speak about what he did to me.

After a few years, when I was 17 or something, he left my mother and she was very depressed.
I always hated my mother for putting her relationship first and not protecting her children. She also has a childish behavior. She was copying my hairstyles, speaking in a high pitched voice when a man came over, getting drunk, etc. I hate her still today.

My father got in a relationship with a woman who has two male kids. He lived in my grandparents house, but when they both died, he brought the woman and her two sons to live in the house.
At this point I didn't know what to do with my life.
On one hand, I couldn't live with my mother with her behavior. On the other hand, I couldn't live in my grandparents house because my father was obsessed with that woman and forced me to treat her like a mother, share everything with her son's and eventually when I got a job, he said I should live somewhere else.

My father was always like Hitler to me. He said I should study AND work, or just work because he won't support me. So I did. I went to the university 2 years, got a job and went to live on my own. A whole accomplishment in this economy in a 2nd or 3rd world country like mine. But I couldn't keep up with the pressure of working in a call center receiving calls and going to the university and getting home at 11 pm, so I quit everything.

I kept getting fired and hired from different call centers constantly.
At that time, my father never came to visit me or call me, and my mother became super protective of me all of the sudden. She wanted to bond. But I think she is disgusting and I hate her.

During that period of my life I was living on the edge, and struggling with a binge eating disorder. I guess it's because I never told them how I felt and I was dying on the inside.

I forgot to mention, I always was bullied at school because I am short and overweight. And my parents always described me as ""distracted"".

I met my husband online casually playing videogames and after texting and talking back and forth for months, we decided to live together. I thought, coming to Germany will fix all my problems. He is aware of my story and is still today very supportive.

Coming here made things worse. Even though I have B2 Deutsch certificate and I tried to get C1, I am scared to speak German. I have cultural shock.
After 7 years it only got worse.
I tried many other jobs, but I've been called slow, incompetent and dumb, I made my coworkers nervous, so I was always getting jobs and quitting.

I got the opportunity to change so I got into a web development Bootcamp. The same month I finished it, I got a job. But after 2 months I got fired again, because they want someone with more experience.

After that I feel like I hit rock bottom. My psychiatrist prescribed me Bupropion Hydrochlorid 300 mg. Because I also have ADHD.
But my anxiety is getting worse. I sweat. I apply for jobs but I am scared to pickup the phone. I have difficulty breathing and I'm sobbing all the time.

I left my husband because I am a burden and I want him to be happy.

So there's more to it but it's been enough for me, I just want to die üò•",15a5jv1,depression

People can be so fucking judgemental. They tend to find me lazy for not taking responsibility and weird for not genuinely wanting things in life. And I need to be thankful for their ""support"" apparently. Their forceful behaviour actually pulls me back into more passivity.

I feel so lonely. I've tried to make friends with people that felt genuinely sympathetic but they often break contact, because they find my stuff too heavy, and because I tend to seek for happiness and a better self-esteem in them in a way that makes them worry about me too much, which burns them out.

482,07-26-2023,"My life seems to be falling into chaos. I‚Äôve been a musician since my teens was really fortunate enough to travel the world with my job, make amazing friends and work with some well-known artists. I even had a record deal. I chose my art and I don‚Äôt regret it but it started to dawn on me in my 30s, that my friends that had chosen to study, and work in boring careers (their words)were financially stable. I‚Äôm financially a lot more comfortable than I was(don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have managed to buy a flat and cars and do them up and I now own a house-sadly with my ex). 

So in my 30s, I was offered an opportunity to teach using my vast experience in the industry and share that knowledge at a university level. The nagging impostor syndrome that I had was really difficult to overcome. The other lecturers I was around had degrees, but no experience I had the experience but no degree. And regardless of the fact that I got great feedback, scored really well in student surveys, the impostor syndrome just seem to beat a drum louder each and every day. Prior to the pandemic I was offered an opportunity to gain a Masters equivalent qualification funded by my uni. It was really difficult to turn off my crippling, self doubt and feelings of being worthless, but I agreed to do it through myself wholeheartedly into it. I had to take a sabbatical for a year during the pandemic because I was working so much supporting the mental health of students. I couldn‚Äôt take on the stress of writing 20,000 word dissertations on education.

 Last year I passed and I have my qualification, the stupid piece of paper that apparently validates me makes me worthwhile. However, during that time management changes at work meant that my value seems to be diminished and all that I had built up with now dwindling where I‚Äôve been working 4 to 5 days a week. I was now being offered one day a week teaching which financially wasn‚Äôt enough for me. I went for an internal promotion, TWICE and was told that I didn‚Äôt have enough management experience, and that was why I was being overlooked. So they gave me my own modules to devise and run. But it seems my work are now looking at hiring newly graduated students with zero experience because they‚Äôre cheap and now as a senior lecturer I‚Äôll be expecting to be remunerated to my value which is double their rate. 

So I made the decision that I needed to leave, and I‚Äôve been actively looking for a new job since last summer, but it seems every job I apply for. I‚Äôm overqualified now even to the point where I‚Äôve been told that they feel I‚Äôll be taking a step back (Isn‚Äôt that my decision to make if that is the case?) And clearly these future employers are actually reading my CV because I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve taught that level quite extensively after all of the levels from 3 to 7. I‚Äôve got a qualification. Employers should be biting in my hands off and yet  I can‚Äôt find another job. And now as the academic year begins to roll around and being forced to return to a place I know doesn‚Äôt value me. 

I should also add here that just prior to studying my long-term relationship broke down, which was fraught and filled with aggression with someone that was clearly unsuitable for me. The mental abuse I suffered from him, really added to my lack of a self worth and imposter syndrome and even now four years on my brain will reply you‚Äôre not worth anything. Good luck trying to find a job you thick idiot!

Last year quite by accident, having sworn off dating because I wanted to spend time on myself to improve my mental health, I met someone. For me, he was perfect. We were on the exact same page for everything. And when I say everything I mean everything from music, tastes to film, political views and sexually. I was just so attracted to him and even though he was younger and there were some red flags. I chose to ignore them telling myself I‚Äôm just having a bit of fun. The relationship got serious feelings started to happen and then he cheated on me. And as worthless as I tell myself, I won‚Äôt really ever let someone do that to me again, so I ended the relationship. And I have been grieving that loss more so than anything else. I cannot stop these thoughts I‚Äôm never going to meet anybody else that‚Äôs going to tick those boxes again that‚Äôs gonna understand or get me because I never have before and if it‚Äôs taken 30 years of dating to find one person, I could be dead by the time I meet the next person Who could tick those boxes again.

So that leads me to exactly where I am now I‚Äôm so depressed, I can barely function I‚Äôm doing the minimum I can on the day. My lack of self-care is becoming fairly evident.I barely function, go to work I do do it but I don‚Äôt care and I‚Äôm starting to think that that‚Äôs becoming obvious. I definitely think it was obvious in my teaching . Perhaps maybe it‚Äôs obvious now in my professional music career who knows? I am parenting I am keeping that together somehow, but there are some days where I just can‚Äôt face going outside and even walking my dog because I don‚Äôt want to talk to people. I‚Äôm ignoring messages I‚Äôm not answering voicemails I‚Äôm not even sending invoices to get paid and I have some financial issues. I have no motivation whatsoever and I can‚Äôt seem to find it anywhere. And it doesn‚Äôt help that my best friend says well perhaps maybe you need to think about a career change perhaps at your age the music isn‚Äôt going to be a viable career for you anymore. And I‚Äôm tired of telling them that I did do that by training to become a teacher and then getting a Masters in education. I did retrain. I just can‚Äôt help that my industry has become so horribly monetised doesn‚Äôt care about the experience or education, or the students only the bottom line. (I appreciate I am naive here).

There are other things that have caused my mental health to plummet most of it personal life, first, but dealing with a narcissist, mother a toxic ex, stressful job and the pandemic seem to have all taken their toll on me. I spend most of the day crying, feeling empty and dead inside wanting to not be here anymore. I‚Äôm realising I have no value or worth for anyone or anything to apparently to be valid in the music industry. Im now too expensive to offer any validation or experience in my industry. I‚Äôm actually now no longer have the energy I used to have to fight back. And I‚Äôve had a history of depression since my teens have always had it and hidden it. I just can‚Äôt do that anymore. And I don‚Äôt even have the finances to get therapy.

I attend doctors, psychiatrists and groups and the thing they always talk about is feeling hopeful for the future, followed by the other positive shite that you can build on. I feel once you're absolutely hopeless, there is nothing to build with. It's like trying to build a skyscraper on nothing but dry sand. I'm sick of being made to feel like it's me who's always in the wrong because of things I know are coming down the line, that I'm just being overly negative.

485,07-26-2023,"Been a while since I last posted so bear with me. I've been (un) happily married for almost 6 years. I thought I had finally met someone with understanding but is anything but. I (M) have been struggling with my mental health a lot over the last couple of years. I feel in my marriage I am not allowed to voice anything without some sort of repercussion. My wife, has voice of authority in the house and literally takes over even when asked not to. I've always grown up to be a gentle soul but even I have episodes of frustration and anger. I do my best to keep it in and most of the time I do, my overthinking goes into hyper drive. 

You may ask, why don't you talk to her about it? Reason being is that I find it impossible. Her severe lack of understanding and even a basic skill like listening is lost on her. Any sort of conversation is fruitless as there is always backlash in everything I say. She accuses me of all sorts and like a dick that I am, I readily accept it or admit to it because I have literally given up. I have suicidal thoughts every day and trying to keep a smile on my face is damn near impossible. 

I have 3 (step) kids and the thought of walking out on them is crippling me. We have tried all sorts of mediation and things are good for a (very) short while before they're back to square one. Am at a loss for words that I honestly believe that my presence on earth is of no value. People would genuinely better off and happier without me.

486,07-26-2023,"CW/TW: self harm, substance abuse


I don‚Äôt really know where to begin. I [30F] have been in a really dark place for half a week now. A little backstory, I‚Äôve suffered with depression for most of my life, was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen, diagnosed with BPD in my mid 20s, and believe I‚Äôve got some undiagnosed neurodiversity. I grew up in a house were feelings were never talked about, sadness was ignored or belittled, and I‚Äôve always felt incredibly lonely.

Over the weekend, I accidentally discovered my partner [35M] has a porn addiction. We‚Äôve been together for getting close to a decade now. The closest I‚Äôve ever gotten to finding out he has a PA was around our 1 year anniversary, I learnt that he was sexting role playing with someone on Instagram. To me, that was a huge betrayal of trust and we almost broke up. He convinced me that he would change, we went to couples therapy together, and I thought that we had moved past it all. Anyway; it turns out that while he was no longer an active participant in his addiction, he has still been on porn sites every single damn day. He seems to think that he has never outright lied to me about the porn stuff, but: we have been dealing with him having erectile dysfunction for a couple of years now and he never once thought to make the connection or talk to me about it, and at one point to try and help our sex life I had suggested that he read me something dirty that turns him on (as I knew he enjoyed reading porn, and he enjoys reading his favourite novels to me) but he completely dismissed it and made it seem like he no longer read any porn. I‚Äôve become an absolute wreck. I thought I knew everything about him. I thought we were close enough that he could of come to me about anything and I would‚Äôve been able to be there for him with very little judgement. And I‚Äôm still somewhat understanding - I‚Äôm empathetic to what he‚Äôs probably going through right now after he‚Äôs been caught out and the breakdown of our relationship. But he has hit so many triggering things for me.

At first it was just the hurt and betrayal of trust and rejection sensitivity. Feeling like I‚Äôm not enough, like I‚Äôm not good enough. And that‚Äôs then triggered a major depressive episode for me. I‚Äôve only been able to sleep once I get so drunk and stoned I can barely function. I‚Äôve self harmed again. And he‚Äôs given me space like I‚Äôve asked for, but in the middle of a depressive episode, it has then triggered all my old abandonment issues. There was a point were I honestly felt like I was 14 again, in the middle of a breakdown and just needing some form of comfort, and hearing people in the other room who know how distressed I am, and they just ignore it. I‚Äôve completely regressed from all the healthy techniques I‚Äôve developed over the years, and am back to all my shitty ones. Every time he talks to me, it‚Äôs to tell me he‚Äôs ‚Äúbooked a doctors appointment‚Äù or he‚Äôs ‚Äúdeleted all the browser history‚Äù or spoken to a friend, or found support groups online, or unfollowed people on Instagram. He hasn‚Äôt once asked how I‚Äôm feeling. How my mental health is handling everything. He has not checked in on me, but seems to expect my support to him. I feel so fucking lonely. I‚Äòbe never known how to sit in these awful feelings. I‚Äôve reached out to one friend, and it was helpful to have someone validate my hurt and my feelings, but the day to day isolation is a lot. It‚Äôs just him, my cat, and myself in our house. All my friends and family live a fair drive away (and I don‚Äôt drive); and even if they didn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know how to really reach out for help. Or how to lean on anyone. I‚Äôve only had two shifts of work, so I‚Äôve felt really stuck in this house. I keep wanting to go out for a walk or something, but instead I can‚Äôt move, I‚Äôm just smoking and drinking and watching Gilmore Girls (which was a huge comfort show for me growing up).

487,07-26-2023,"Ill be turning 29 soon and I find as of late I'm filled,  1almost constantly with immense dread towards the future. I feel like humanity is being,  for lack of a better word ""attacked"" on all fronts. Whether it's AI decimating the workforce, climate change making the planet uninhabitable, a shift to a dystopian society, the cost of living continuing to rise. It all just feels overwhelming. 

I realize that it's not healthy to think about such things all the time and I genuinely try not to and focus on the moment more. But I also understand that nothing is forever and sure things might be fine for now but 40-50 years from now or even just 5 years who knows.

One of the things I struggle with personally, that makes it difficult is a complete lack of self confidence. I don't believe that if and when things get tough I'll have the ability to get through it by myself. I'm close'ish with some of my family and talking to them offers momentary relief but I also worry about their futures as well as the rest of humanities.

I've tried therapy but the person I was seeing was horrible. They didn't help me work through my anxieties and depression at all, they just sat there and let me vent for an hour. I can't al least for now afford to go shopping for the right therapist because that's expensive. 

I have a loose plan as to what I wanna do,  but with all the uncertainty it feels pointless making any kind of plans. I kind of just want to give up and take the easy way out  but I care to much about the people in my life to put them through that.

I'm not really sure what I hope to gain by posting this. perhaps just knowing that other people feel the same, or advice on how to get through this funk. My gut tells me I should get land somewhere and live off grid but again I don't  believe that's something I have the strength to do myself let alone the financial aspect of it.

488,07-26-2023,"Hi guys 

I'm 34 here. The title says it all. I'm stuck in a country and city I don't really like and in an easy wage slave job that I tolerate for the money. I have some businesses which I've been building in the last 2-3 years that I hoped would give me the adequate funds I needed to relocate to a more desirable place overseas and further grow from. But those businesses are making no money and are stagnant atm, if not forever. I'm bored as fuck by my routine life, with few friends, no relationship or sex prospects either. Haven't had physical intimacy in over 2 years. Been feeling like this intermittently for a long time. I'm very frustrated, hopeless, stuck, jealous of other successful people and the ease of which others succeed, and becoming more embittered every day as I realize time is running out as I am only getting older and still a nobody. I feel and am starting to believe that my life will continue this way. I don't see how it could possibly improve. I feel like the universe has screwed me over and that it and people are working against me. Meanwhile other people have all the success and happiness handed to them on a silver plate. I don't want this life. I'm trying to build the life I want but feel it's pointless in trying as I was born into peasantry and will likely stay in my class. I feel like I should just accept my place in life and not hope for anything beyond that. But I can't stop from wanting more. 

I want to hear from others who've been through these challenges and were able to overcome them. How did you do it? or what circumstances changed?

489,07-26-2023,"Grew up in bad conditions. Haven't seen my fathers side of the family since I was ten, we got sued by him all the time, had no money, had to be in court at the age of 8 because of these, was absolutely terrible.  
When I became an adult I decided to do a dual education (getting bachelors degree and apprenticeship combined) just to make a safe living.However, my mom left me, left the country... my grandma died of cancer... I had to drive 3 hours a day, write exams, work full time, had to quit all hobbies, no friends...  
And suddenly I felt worse and worse. Suddenly felt terrible, couldn't understand what people said. Sat in my desk and couldn't think for half the day. Woke up next to my bed with brain concussion and bruises... Docs said it was the stress. went through a ton of tests, nothing. Went worse and worse for 2 years. My performance dropped hard, lost my job etc..  
2 months later I ended up in hospitals, got checked for 2 weeks till they finally said that were seizures. Gave me meds and I was cured for 2 weeks.  
Then it got worse. Much worse. Some docs were doubting the diagnose while it got up to 8 seizures per day. After 3 months in the hospital i got moved to a highly specialized hospital. They confirmed the diagnose and found a blob in my brain that might or might not be a tumor. Few days later I tried to contact a friend from school I haven't seen in years and found out she died and I missed her funeral in that time.had to spend another 3 months in that hospital.Tested a ton of meds, which trust me, is hell on earth. Got seizures down to 20 minutes per day with pure pain as one of the symptoms.Got released for 2 months till tests for a surgery came, another 2 weeks in hospital. another month just waiting for the surgery, another 2 months in hospital for and after the surgery... like... 9 months total in hospitals.  
Still seizures, some brain damage, no degree, job or any perspective.I actually managed to get fundings for a different degree that fits me with my disability better. Was a nice topic. Met friends, had a new chance. Moved in with a friend. Thought life could get better.  
well...seizures costs me a ton of time and energy making studying so much harder. Failed classes or even had to stop mid exam and go to the hospital because of it. Covid hit us. A ton of other stuff went wrong. like‚Ä¶ there is a disaster every quarter of the year. But I still tried my best.  
well‚Ä¶ last year a tornado hit us. Enough of a reason for our landlord to raise the prices as high as possible. Relations went down so my best friend suddenly came and said ""yh sorry, ima leave"". I had to find a new home in the worst timing possible. The one I found forced me to go through and throw away almost everything I had. It cost me weeks of the semester. My grandpa started having heart disease, my mom hurt me harder than anyone ever for the stupidest reason possible... I still can't look her in the face. Got news that made having a family basically impossible. Father tried to contact me after 20 years because of terrible news I can't talk about here that cost me another 2 weeks. Exams went absolutely terrible after all this. Also the worst professor ever started another \* show where 2/3 failed with even worse factors. I got benched in my only hobby and lost the only thing that was fun. I have to pray they extend the funding but even if...  
I don't know. I thought after losing my job and 9 months in hospitals life couldn't get worse. That I could still make it. But no matter what, life finds a way to destroy everything again. Last ten years left their mark, but last year just was the final straw. And I see no way of ever coming back",15a1gjq,depression

My social anxiety got the better of me, and I became the social pariah. Whenever I would tell my parents about kids at school bullying me, they blamed me for not being more social and assertive. In my teenage years, I became suicidal. I remember trying to say to my mom one day ""I just feel so sad all the time..."". She replied ""shut up! shut up!"" She then told me that I was ungrateful because I grew up way wealthier than she did. 

Throughout high school, I always had to be the strong one of all my friends. My other friends didn't have the same luxuries as me, so they were allowed to go to therapy and cry freely. I even cursed out my best friend one time, because she kept making jokes about suicide. I felt like she was being disrespectful to me (even though she didn't know I was suicidal).

I was always the fastest on the team (at least top three in my younger years most likely lol) so I could get to balls quick and I could steal a base whenever I wanted. In my first few years I had trouble hitting the ball so I worked on trying to get walks and got a pretty good eye for balls and strikes. In middle school I started to hit the ball really good. Never home runs just easy singles but I could steal to third no problem. I finally got good. And I had no problem reading breaking balls.

Basically it's gotten to the point where if they don't offer, I don't ask.)

Then the next step feeling the overwhelming knowledge that all it would take is a bottle of pills. No one would even  notice for days. Minimum.

The next painful step accompanied by a swell of guilt because your sisters need you. Your sister already lost a sister in law last year. Your other sisters getting married soon. You can't ruin her wedding. Your first sister wants to go back to school and she'll need a reliable babysitter.

Another step, searing pain shooting up your leg and through your hip, seriously you'd never have to be in pain again. Just nothingness. Free.

A wavering stumble. How long would it take for people to not care? Maybe a few months. Just enough time for them to wondering why nothings been reorganized. Maybe they'd be better off. No one to nag them that they should restock their work areas so when it gets busy again. There not scrambling.

Another step, another though about what needs to be reorganized at work. How laundry will be necessary tomorrow if you have time after the wedding walk through and before work. Maybe taken in any bottles you've been saving so you could afford something at the dollar store.

502,07-26-2023,"Hello everyone. So I need to get something off my chest.

I'm a 27 year old woman who has the tendency to get depressed. 

My story with depression and anxiety started at 11. My first panic attack was in school, when my brain completely frooze while taking a school exam. Since then, it never completely stopped. My mom took me to a child psychologist and he told her that I was just an anxious child and I will always be that way... it was in me.

I moved away from home when I was 18 in order to go to Law School (I'm from a country in Europe). In this city I eventually met my partner in 2016 and we've been together ever since, living together. In 2017 I had this huge depressive episode where I would have constant panic attacks due to having some bad intrusive thoughts. I lost 8 kilos and then I gained it all back and more because I oscilated between having no appetite and binge eating everything that was in front of me. Eventually, with a lot of help from him and some mental work, I was able to get past that. 

In 2019 I finished Law School. It took me 1 and a half year longer to finish my degree because of my anxiety on having oral exams. And my anxiety always made me believe that I was not gonna make it in the Law world. I was not confident in my abilities so I didn't even want to try, even though I love Civil law.

So I made the stupid mistake to take a Culinary course (18 months) and since February I've been working in an hotel kitchen. And it's safe to say I effing hate it. I work with 5 other men and it's a sexist environment. The bosses are horrible and they don't follow work law at all. I'm a cook and I have to do extra hours because at the end of the lunch service, they decided that I'm the one in charge of doing the dishes. I work more than 10 hours a day and I don't have the energy to do anything. I just lay in the couch and I get super irritated with everything. And it's starting to affect my relationship with my partner. I also don't get weekends, which he has.

I'm so burned out that I'm starting to have irrational thoughts. I seriously would rather have the strongest flu because that means I wouldn't have to go to work. I can't focus on anything. I feel like I'm on pilote mode, to be honest. I just wish I could go back in time and found the confidence in myself to continue pursuing my Law career. I have a 1 year contract in the hotel, and it ends on February 2024. I just don't know if I could handle this nightmare until then. However, I can't afford to quit. 

I feel so stupid for wasting my years. I'm turning 28 next month, and I see no bright future or happiness awaiting me.",15a0kll,depression

504,07-26-2023,"Fxe (research chem thats like a cousin tk ketamine) alcohol and cocaine. I just dont have any drive to get better i know its bad but i dont want anything anymore. I had my dream girl and still found myself here. I dont even think getting rich would solve it I just dont want a part in any of it anymore. Lost a friend to suicide when I was 15 and I know ill never inflict that kind of pain/struggle on the people close to me but its all ive wanted for years. Ive pretty much given up and my main goal is to just quietly be self sufficient and not bring harm woth my existence. 

This was the first week i tried fxe and it has a mania side effect. Ended up sending like $300 fucking dollars to reddit porn girls. I had therapists telling me ‚Äúthis is your rock bottom‚Äù when i was 16 and the whole time I was thinking ‚Äúive already been through worse‚Äù but THIS feels like my rock bottom. It all feels like a scam and I have such a deep rooted belief that I am just ‚Äúbad‚Äù that I dont know if I can ever change it. 

Like at least the porn chicks were a personal decision. i can at least lesrn from it but working 12 hour overnight shifts or just working 40+ hours a week at all just to not be homeless? being told life is a gift and you just need to appreciate it/ be grateful feels like a scheme to make everyone forget that it doesnt HAVE to be this way. Maybe ive just been depressed rhe last 21 years and thats always possible but i know im not the only one thinking we live in a dystopia created by the uber wealthy. 


I did heroin last week for the first time. Purposefully fell asleep on my back because then at least its an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù and woke up sick as fuck. I work 6pm-6am but it allows me to pay rent and have extra cash for drugs. I dont know how long ive got left but Im basically trying to shorten it any way I can. My biggest fear is letting it affect me so bad i become a burden on my family before it kills me. I tossed the heroin after that one time and dont really plan on getting more because it was just dumb. 

I dont want a relationship i dont want friends I just want out. I remember coming down off acid when i was 15 thinking ‚Äúi could die right now and be happy‚Äù then panicking about how bad Im gonna fuck it up and wishing i could just die then. Its not anyones fault I just dont wanna be here but there isnt a way out.

Im 21 and I know im fucking myself over early but I cant think of anything I want to work towards. I might regret it, i already kind of do but I cant do it and at least the drugs are something to do",15a0hxl,depression
505,07-26-2023,"I‚Äôm 21 years old and I have been struggling with my mental health since I was a teenager. What really has pushed me over the edge was when I was 18 I was disfellowshipped from my church. Basically growing up I could only hang out and be friends with people in the church so I never had school or work friends and when this happened all my friends I grew up with cut contact with me and it‚Äôs been so hard. My family is really hard on me to I still live with them but they tell me everyday that they don‚Äôt want me here. I didn‚Äôt even get invited to my brothers wedding and my grandma recently passed and they mentioned everyone of my family members beside me. I can‚Äôt eat at the table with them, when they have people over I eat on the floor in my room and I have so much anxiety even going to the bathroom when they are there. My girlfriend is not a witness and we struggle because my parents don‚Äôt want her over and she is the only thing keeping me here rn. I have attempted suicide before and was put on 51/50 but I promise my GF that I would never do that again but it‚Äôs been so hard recently. I go to therapy I have a psychiatrist I take all my meds and I‚Äôve tried so many but nothing is helping. A friend once told me don‚Äôt make a permanent solution to a temporary problem but it‚Äôs been 3 years and I don‚Äôt see my family changing at all. I can‚Äôt afford to move out and neither can my gf so I‚Äôm stuck here. My family always goes on trips with me but then they say I don‚Äôt show them I appreciate all they do for me. And it‚Äôs hard because yes they could kick me out and yes they provide me food even tho I eat in my room but it still feels like it‚Äôs never gonna end. It‚Äôs been a problem in my relationship and with reason it makes sense likes my family only like people who are part of the religion and my gf isn‚Äôt so it‚Äôs hard on her and she debates if she wants to marry into my family. This problem is unfixable I don‚Äôt make enough money I was going to go to college but my parents didn‚Äôt want me to and I have car payments so I can‚Äôt save or afford rent with prices now. I‚Äôve been wanting to kill myself. I wrote notes for each of my family members and one just for everyone but when I get to writing one for my gf I can‚Äôt write it I can‚Äôt do it. I wanna break up with her just so I can kill myself. I‚Äôve been on disability for 6 months because of my depression and all I‚Äôve been doing recently is sleeping I go to bed at 3am and wake up at 5pm then go back to bed and wake up at 11/12 and stay up all night. I don‚Äôt eat at all in the last 2 days I‚Äôve had some Chips and fish sticks, and no one seems to care. I‚Äôve reached out for help professionally and it‚Äôs not helping and I can‚Äôt ask my friends or family because I don‚Äôt have any, my gf is the only one but I don‚Äôt want to put so much pressure on her because she is dealing with her parents divorce and has life tough as is. My sister is having a kid soon and all I‚Äôve been thinking about is if I should do it before or after she has her.

506,07-26-2023,"I‚Äôm honestly at the point where I just want to die and I‚Äôm not even scared of doing it myself like I was for a long time. I‚Äôve fucked up my entire life all on my own and there‚Äôs no point in trying anymore. I‚Äôve known there was something wrong with me ever since I was eight, screaming and crying for god to just kill me. I‚Äôm ugly, fat, and have no redeeming qualities at all. No one has ever liked me romantically and no matter what I do I‚Äôm always the fat ‚Äòfunny‚Äô friend because of my people pleasing tendencies. I‚Äôve ruined my education by joking around instead of paying attention in math class when i was younger, leading to me not being able to understand anything and falling behind. I used to be a gifted honors student, now look at me. I was thrown around different schools all my life because of my parents divorcing, so I went into freshman year with no friends or even people that looked like me or could relate to me. Fucked up most of my classes there, then covid hit. I tried my best at the beginning but online classes didn‚Äôt hold me accountable so I just didn‚Äôt go for the rest of the year. Neither of my parents cared or helped either, so I had no real determination to complete schoolwork. Junior year I did pretty well, went to a school with people like me and was even on the varsity softball team. I even had my own cat, and he was my sole reason for living and trying to be better. Unfortunately I had him for less than two years, as he died in my arms the weekend before my birthday. I easily slipped back into my old state, and missed my first week of senior year. I told my mom to just enroll me in some credit recovery school because I wouldn‚Äôt have graduated on time anyways. The few friends I have all think I‚Äôve graduated and can believe my lie because I don‚Äôt post any pictures of myself anyways. So a missing photo of me in a cap and gown doesn‚Äôt seem suspicious, or maybe they just don‚Äôt care at all. I‚Äôve barely been doing the minimum requirements for the credit recovery school and with the way I‚Äôm going I‚Äôm not expected to graduate for another two years. I would take my GED but I‚Äôll probably fail that too and waste the little money my mom does have. So now I‚Äôm just stuck, an idiotic eighteen year old girl with four friends at most. I used to have real passions like softball and playing the clarinet, but now both of those aren‚Äôt accessible to me anymore. I‚Äôve tried getting a job and learning to drive to help my mom but she wouldn‚Äôt and still won‚Äôt let me help at all or be independent. So now I‚Äôm just stuck as a useless waste of a human being who can do nothing but contemplate death. There‚Äôs definitely more I‚Äôm leaving out but it‚Äôs just sad self pitying details that I‚Äôll spare you from having to read.

526,07-26-2023,"I recently turned 19 and I've had a long history with depression. Specifically I have Major Depressive Disorder, anxiety and adhd, (doctors were between adhd and bpd so maybe both but idk yet), and I wasn't able to get help for any of it until I went to university were we have free mental health recourses and I was able to get diagnosed and start meds and therapy.

Before then all though high school I relied on my friend who also struggled with mental health and we kind of kept each other afloat, but I was always pretty shy and I was scared of telling people what I struggled with.

I had a boyfriend I was with for 1 1/2 years but he broke up with me a few months ago, and now without him I just have my friend from high school who I have started to rely on to talk about my feelings and the things I'm going though just to get it off my chest. But I feel like I'm just annoying him and everyone around me, My friends in university helped me out a lot, but now during the summer we don't live close, and I feel like they don't really care or take me seriously if I talk about my feelings which is ok, or at least that's what I tell myself. 

This may sound stupid but Billie Eilish's new song ""What Was I Made For?"" really hit me so hard because of the line:

I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend  
It's not what he's made for

And it hurts so much because I feel like part of the reason he left was because I was too much to deal with emotionally and I would tell him when I was sad and my thoughts and feelings because I really did feel like he was all I needed to be happy, and I just wanted to be heard and comforted by him. But now that he's gone and with this song, it makes me think I was overstepping and was using him as some sort of therapist or something, and he isn't ""made for"" all of my sadness. 

I find that line keep popping up in my head when my high school friend asks me what is wrong: ""It's not what he's made for"".

I don't want to drive him away, he's the only friend who texts me every day, and usually he's the only friend who texts me at all. I feel so truly alone and I don't know if it's all in my head but I feel like he's avoiding me or finds me annoying, as well as my other university friends and whenever I think about saying anything that line comes back again: ""It's not what he's made for""

I don't think I can do it all by myself, my summer has been just work and staying home for the most part. I don't have friends to hang out with. I don't have people to talk to throughout the day. My phone is so quiet. I feel the most alone I've been in years. But is it my fault? Am I distancing myself? I just don't want to be left alone again. I think being completely alone is my worst fear.

529,07-26-2023,"It has been a couple months since i heard from her. First of all, I know for fact she is alive and well. And yes it is correct to assume the relationship is finished. But some clarification from people who suffer the same as her, might help my understanding.

She became slightly more distant in the ending week, but nothing i hadn't experienced before. Except this time she explained that she will need to cut contact with me to relieve some of that pressure that comes with being depressed and being in a relationship. (not wanting to bring their issues into the relationship and possibly damage it, not wanting to make me their support system and wanting to push through on her own, not dragging someone else down with them etc.) 

I was fine with this, obviously upset but if thats what will help her then so be it. I am fine if i never hear from her again, and will be glad if i do hear from her again. But i'm curious. Was my decision to respect the space a wise one? Or should i have still contacted every so often to see how she is going. At this stage it has been a couple months, the last message a sent i explained my point of view on everything, explained that she was never a burden, that i love her either way and i understand if she can't handle it, hope she grows as a person and becomes healthier in her mindset. So i feel i said everything i could have, but would it have been a smart idea to continue to check in or visit here and there to show the support, or was it wiser to respect the decision to cut contact. 

She also doesn't have many support systems, and believes she struggles less when she is able to deal with it alone, and not have the added pressure on her psyche that she might be inadvertently negatively affecting the ones that support her with her struggles.

People have many varying opinions on this type of thing, as i've read. But i wonder what the ones that struggle with it think.",159wuqn,depression

531,07-26-2023,"Growing up, I had a good family life but a rough social life. I don‚Äôt remember if it was because I was awkward or the color of my skin, but I never had friends growing up. I made a few when I got to high school but we all ended up going in separate directions after we graduated. In college I joined a co-ed frat and made friends but much like high school, we lost contact after graduation. A few of them pop up every now and then but its been so long that all we remember is that we liked each other at some point. 

I took a year off after college to find a career to pursue but I always eyed exit. I bounced back and forth between jobs and during the pandemic, I did door dash which led to doing deliveries at Amazon. I enjoyed that job. Eventually I became a dispatcher, it was fun then the rest of the leadership team started to leave and my position morphed into something that was pure stress and I was forgotten when everyone else got raises. 

Doing deliveries was what I enjoyed so when I stumbled upon the post office I went for it. More money and it had a future, I wanted it to work. When it was even more stressful than being a dispatcher it broke me. Deliveries was all I was good it, it made me happy at one point. Eventually I quit and went back to Amazon and became a driver again. With the mew metrics and ever increasing work load, I dont know if it still makes me happy.

I don‚Äôt know where to go, what to pursue, and where to go. Im getting close to my 30s and have no plan for my life. I have no real friends because they either leave without a trace or we drift apart. I have nothing to look forward too. I have no idea where the path ahead is.

Granted I left out a good chunk involving over achieving cousins, horrific break ups, and loosing interest in hobbies. Its scary thinking ahead, I spend most of my time laying in bed thinking, drifting in and out of consciousness. Im alone, im scared, and I dont know what to do.",159w9uz,depression

I decided to start a tutoring business during the summer, but it was slow to take off. It took a few weeks before I finally started to get clients, but now some of them are leaving for summer vacation. This has made me question my abilities and whether I'm doing enough. Despite earning $1300 USD this month, I still feel like it's not enough. On top of that, I've been working tirelessly on my digital notes business, but I haven't had any sales yet. I'm torn between pushing myself to earn more money and taking some time to rest this summer. Additionally, I'm worried that once I start university, my tutoring business will suffer, and I won't make as much money.

541,07-26-2023,"I've struggled with depression most my life, but I had a really, really severe spell last year. It was probably the worst my mental health has ever been. I graduated college right into COVID, which caused the job offer I had to be rescinded when lockdowns began. Failed interview after failed interview later, I stopped trying and took a sales job that I hate. I felt like such a failure with no future. Previously undiagnosed ADHD (I was diagnosed just this year, less than 2 months ago) made working consistently on my own projects so difficult, and soon so much time had passed that I felt ashamed that I hadn't done anything in my field. Not even little things.

And then, late last year, while I was cleaning a family storage unit after a relative passed away I came across some papers and drawings I had held on to since Middle School. My degree is in Game Design, and those drawings were the very first game I ever made over a decade ago. I always kept them because I liked looking at them and seeing how far I'd come. But I felt like such a failure and a useless person...I threw them away. These papers had come with me across multiple moves and phases of my life, they were always a source of strength. But not anymore.

I didn't even remember this had happened. My mental health is improving now, although I still have some very bad days. I was feeling better about my major and my work, so I thought to go get those papers to back them up finally...I spent the better part of the day looking until my sibling reminded me what I had done.

And now I'm just...heartbroken, somehow. Like a little piece of me is gone. Those papers were irreplaceable, and now I'm so incredibly sad, I've spent the night (sometimes unsuccessfully) fighting tears. I can't believe that I did that. I feel awful.",159ujwo,depression

I was angry, moody and so apathetic to life that I didn't care if I was alive or not. Not wanting to unalive myself, just extremely indifferent. I thought I'd made a lot of progress, I had to stop going because I couldn't afford it w/ no insurance at the time. But here we are again. I've given up on online dating (it's never gone well for me) and social media in general, nobody puts any genuine effort into getting to know people anymore. I'm tired of trying to make connections with people, to relate to them, try and form friendships. I just don't care anymore. I decided last week to take a break from social media and to only focus on my business and getting financially stable. But it's not working exactly how I'd hoped. I feel more alone now than ever and realize how addicted I am to the social media dopamine fix, but I can't take how invisible I feel trying to be seen by people that don't care. Or at least realizing how just another stranger on the internet I am. I've never had luck with relationships, months ago I was at a point that I'd been single so long that just the thought of meeting someone or even attempting to date gave me anxiety. As I was sitting here at my PC, listening to music, it hit me that just the mere thought of a relationship sent me spiraling downwards. I have no hope that it will ever happen to me. I'm trying to learn to be ok alone, but I'm so tired of that. I'm really really tired of being surrounded by a loving family but feeling so hopelessly alone.

It takes about $80 a session for the cheapest one where I live and I'm a student with no money. Neither do my parents, we live month to month. It's a lie. The therapist thing only works for people with a nice paying well established job or a rich family. Which most of us don't have.

I can seem to overcome my kiddo (f15) multiple suicide attends and the sad part is that she knows it and uses it as a tool of manipulation to control me.  For example, if she gets caught doing something wrong using drugs or sneaking out at night to get drunk with her friends. She tells me that she is depressed and that she cuts herself and that puts me on overdrive, and I worry about her a lot. She has been to therapist but recently I caught her using her snapchat stating that she lies in therapy in order to get what she wants. I'm extremely depress because I'm scared that she's going to kill herself. I have tried to call the cops on her when I caught her stealing beer, and they just tell me nothing they can do even if she runs away and comes back after a few hours or days they tell me nothing they can't do. I can't send her to rehab or a mental health facility due to her age. In the state that we live in she needs doctor recommendation in order to get her admitted but they have to interview her alone due to patient privileges and she just lies her ass off to the doctors and therapist and it's a total joke that I'm crying for help, and nobody listens to me. On one occasion I called 911 because she just left school with her friends, and she wasn't on the school when tried to pick her up I didn't know what happened to her and the cops just basically told me we will look for her and call us if she shows up. A few hours later she shows up all high and I called the cops again because she's high and I want them to take her away because She's high and we are arguing a lot. She has accused me of being abusive before and I don't want problems anymore and they just tell me it looks like a parenting issue and nothing they can't do.

574,07-26-2023,"I'm 22.5 years old and I feel like everything is ruined.  Idk if it's child abuse or just me being shit, but I'm so far behind in everything.

Socially I never had friends growing up.  I was a loner not by choice but by inability to fit in or communicate properly.  I have severe social anxiety which plays a big part in this.  Now I have online friends which are good however my self hatred and depression is pushing them away.  I try so hard to be positive around them but the brokenness seeps through and I'm terrified one day they will leave me.

Mentally I'm a disaster.  I have depression, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, ADHD, ocd, and cptsd.  Growing up I was molested and dealt with abusive parents, who I still live with and are even worse to me now because accomplishing nothing in life makes them think I deserve it.  And I can't even stand up for myself because I have nothing to stand on.  I'm a complete failure.  I can't even form coherent sentences when confronted.  I can't handle any amount of pressure or stress.  I can't communicate my feelings maturely at all.  I regularly do immature shit like ignoring people, storming off, and being passive aggressive.  I'm better at catching myself and stopping but I'm so far from being a mature adult who doesn't do this at all.

Physically my life is a mess.  I won't leave my bed if my parents are around.  I won't use the bathroom, won't eat, won't do hygienic stuff.  I'm disgusting for this.  And when I do eat it's often not healthy.  I want to eat healthy because it feels better in the body.  I did so at college but at home I can't even do any change because I'm scared of my parents.

I couldn't succeed in high school, shaky success in college, no degrees to show for it yet.  I got fired from my job for having a mental break down.

And then there is my dark past.  All the major fuck ups I try to hide from the world.  When I was 18 I told a 13 year old I was suicidal.  And I told other children in our online community about my problems.  Completely stupid I wouldn't understand the boundaries an adult should have with a child.  When I was 18 I also said inappropriate things while gaming, like wishing chronic illnesses onto people's families and calling people losers.  I also used to tell people online they were the reason I'm suicidal when they beat me in a game.  I've also engaged in a gross amount of online sexual conversations with people.  I feel so much shame for my mistakes.  I feel like if any of my friends knew about this they would stop talking to me.  They would hate me for ever doing those things, as I was an adult and 100% should have known better.

No matter how much I grow these mistakes are something I feel I can never outrun.  And seeing people I went to school with graduating their undergrads while I'm a fucking mess who hasn't matured since high school.  It feels hopeless.  How do I get out of here?  How do I fix myself?  I feel too broke to move out and too broke for therapy.

582,07-26-2023,"Hello everyone,  
  
  
I've been depressed for a long, long time. In fact, I'm not even sure when I was last happy... I've tried therapy, I've tried medicine, nothing has worked for me. Accepting this has oddly been helpful.  
  
  
There are lots of reasons for this: chronic health conditions that seem to multiply with age. Frustration with my marriage. In recent years, increasing desperation and frustration from my career.  
  
  
Lately I just find it hard to get out of bed, I hate my work and if I could, I would just quit it (but there's bills so that's not going to happen). Overall, things have not been going well. A few years ago I started making more risky choices with my career - none of which have paid off and some have even backfired. I've tried partnering with people to work on common goals and it was shocking (and very disappointing) to see how many were just trying to take advantage of me. At least I got better at identifying those people. At this point, even very minor success would considerably cheer me up, and while I don't think it should be unattainable, it clearly is not happening. I'm starting to accept this.  
  
  
I've been thinking lately: What's the point of it all? Just grow older, become frail, see my world dwindle down? I can't see how it would make things better, and in fact, it's just likely to make things worse. I feel like there's fewer and fewer things that bring me happiness, and almost nothing in my daily existence. I can imagine situations that make me happy but never actually manage to get there.. it's very Sisyphean. Every day just brings depression, stress and frustration.  
  
  
At this point, I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm wasting my life, doing things that clearly make me unhappy... but I don't see a way out. I'm just tired of feeling so depressed, more so when I don't see it getting better - just getting worse. I wish there was some change I could do that would make me happier... but I can't think what that would be.",159qegl,depression
583,07-26-2023,"Hi, I'm sorry to post about something that I understand just isn't that serious compared to what so many other people here are going through...

In addition to depression, I struggle really bad with OCD and anxiety. My OCD has recently ruined anime for me, and I don't know if it will ever get better.

In short, I watched some stupid video called ""all anime characters are cats"" and I CAN'T UNSEE IT. Also, I cannot stop thinking about it. I suddenly cannot innocently and carefree enjoy anime like I've done for the past 5 years. My OCD has driven me to depression with this.

I guess it makes sense, because anime has been a significant source of happiness and relaxation and joy for me for a long long time. I just don't know what to do now that suddenly, in the blink of an eye, its been ruined. But I don't know why I'm posting this. Nobody cares, it's stupid, I bet people probably wonder if I'm shit posting or can't even figure out wtf I'm talking about. But I can't control it. Or at least, this feels out of my control; like, ffs, I don't know in advance that a stupid piece of YouTube content is going to implant some weird thought and / or visual in my mind that I can't get rid of and ruins my day, my week, sometimes even longer, and ultimately leaves me a depressed wreck. In this case it's made it impossible to enjoy anime. I don't know if I'll ever be able to enjoy anime again, and as much of a first-world-problem as that is, it's made me incredibly depressed.

Sometimes, I really hate my brain (and my life, but that's a whole nother story that's way bigger than something dumb like this). I just want it to stop. I wish I'd never seen that video and never had these thoughts or images in my mind that won't stop ruining this for me. It's times like these that I wish thoughts or ideas that make me depressed could be singularly erased from my brain. All I can do is just lay in bed and stare at my ceiling right now. Idk if I'll ever watch anime again because of this stupid effing video, and it makes me so angry that I've just completely shut down.",159pvpn,depression

I had been having awful sleeping problems and was on two medications, Lamotragine and Topiramate. by the time I had completely weened off of the lamotrigine i could sleep like a baby. But I'm still not all there mentally. One google search told me that 10% of those taking Topiramate can suffer depression, and I've been taking it twice a day for years.

Of course I was shaken to the core, as their deaths were unexpected but I tried to keep going to school and maintain my job at the time. However, about a year into their deaths, my depression became too insurmountable and I dropped out of school and quit my job. I did get my GED eventually, but I‚Äôve never gotten a new job or had any ambition for my future like I did a few years ago. On top of all this, I was diagnosed with cervical instability due to my hyper-mobility which causes great pain in my neck and spine. I‚Äôm 21, and have no close friends, no girlfriend, no job and just feel like the polar opposite of what my family hoped for me. Many nights I spend crying because I sense disappointment from everyone, and just wish I could speak to my mother again. It‚Äôs funny how I lose 3 of the most important people in my life, and God decides to strike me with a chronic illness to make my hardships even worse. I‚Äôm trying to improve myself everyday, but it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to keep fighting what I worry is a losing battle. A lot of my depressive thoughts consist of longing for the past (being happier, being healthier, having friends). It‚Äôs a shame I haven‚Äôt repaid back the effort my family put into raising me. I‚Äôm not going to give up, but I just needed to let it out as talking to a therapist hasn‚Äôt really been beneficial to me yet.

The reason of why I'm writing this post is because suddenly, me (21M), an extrovert person doesn't really feel like talking to anyone anymore. Just want to push away my friends, I don't really care anymore, of course I aprecciate them so that's why I'm so curious about what's going on. I just want to study and earn tons of money, maybe with that I could be fine.

588,07-25-2023,"I am feeling suicidal and I am having self harm urges. I know I need to check myself in, but I am scared for several reasons.

First, I don't know how my wife will handle it. She is problematically codependent. She is getting help for it, but I doubt she could handle being alone right now.

Second is my work. Due to depression I have been doing poor work lately, and I fear that if I were to go into a hospital, I wouldn't have a job when I come out. 

Third is my caffeine dependence. I drink about 400 to 500 MG per day. It's a major issue, but I am terrified of the withdrawal. I get a migraine if I don't have any within the first 2 hours of waking up. I don't know if I'm allowed to have any in the hospital. 

Fourth and last is my family. My wife's siblings (all adopted and much younger) look to me like some kind of super hero. I don't want to break that image. 

Fifth is my dog. My wife and I have a 1 year old puppy who is so happy and joyful and I know it's stupid, but I don't want her to worry about me not coming home. She won't understand where I am. I work from home and she would be alone all day while my wife is at work. That's not fair to our puppy.

But the problem is that I couldn't get out of my comfort zone and by the time I get even narrow and narrow. And now I every day, curse, blame and wish to disappear because I wasn't able to change, especially in recent years after I passed 30 years old. My parent and siblings supported me at every step and helped me. I don't think someone could have as much patience as they have considering they are extremely busy and don't even have spare time to get into depression. It's easy to blame yourself instead of changing. The worst thing is that I hurt my lovely family as they wanted to see me happy and they did everything they can having difficulty in their lives, another worst thing is that by age it gets not possible to realise your dreams and you get much more other problems in life. I just want to disappear as I don't think I will be able to change myself and become who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do for my family. I had everything to make my dreams true but I failed.

I have no motivation whatsoever to pursue anything regarding a job. I‚Äôm 100% sure I also suffer from severe ADHD which just exacerbates things because I find myself being hyper focused on things that will bring me no good, constantly getting distracted, paralysis analysis as well as physically not being able to do certain things if one thing isn‚Äôt finished and it plagues me.

597,07-25-2023,"Alright so I've (18F)  basically always been depressed as long as I can remember basically. Every year it feels like it gets worse. I just don't see a way out of my slow depressive spiral. 

For context I'm not really sure why I'm depressed which sucks. My best guess is that I am chronically lonely; I have had absolutely no friends since I was in Elementary School and since I graduated High School not even acquaintances and I hate it but I don't blame people. I'm super boring to be around. The only time my social life looked like it might actually start existing then COVID took that and so much away from me. I think god/the universe just hate me (idfk what is out there).

Another reason I thought I was depressed is gender dysphoria. I'm trans and I absolutely just hate my body and while my parents have been accepting a lot of my family sucks and I live in a pretty conservative city. I was able to start getting medication for transitioning but since starting I've felt happier but I don't think it's really helping my depression at all.

At this point I'm just starting to give up and I have no energy. I just don't see myself ever getting better and I feel like I'm behind so many people my age on starting my life. I have no job largely because I'm scared people will not hire me because I'm Trans even though that'd be illegal in my country or because of a million reasons my anxiety cooks up for why I can't apply for a job. I'm pretty broke and I live with my parents, I'm such a disappointment. I haven't put any effort into creating a social or dating life because I don't feel like I deserve it. It just feels like I'm incapable of helping myself.

599,07-25-2023,"Hi Reddit, I‚Äôm not sure if anyone will read this but I‚Äôm going to try and jot down my thoughts in hopes of getting some feedback. 

I‚Äôm a 19 year old male, Im a second year university student with ADHD that has been diagnosed since around first grade. I had a pretty good upbringing, there is no real shortage of anything in my family and I‚Äôm fortunate enough that they can pay for my secondary education. 

My dilemma is that I have grown complacent. I get feelings that I want to try to do something new and productive such as going to the gym, making new friends or starting a business, but I never do. When I see successful people my age on social media I think to myself that I want to be just like them. I know that if I put even the slightest amount of work in that I will be able to feel more satisfied with my life then it is right now, but I never do.

My dad is the best at everything he does. He played college level football for a number of years and was inducted into our states hall of fame. He became a microbiologist, and then later a world renowned surgeon who has invented surgeries that have impacted possibly millions of people for the better. I want to live up to his legacy, which is part of the reason why I am kicking myself so much over my uselessness. 

Years of not achieving the things I believed I was capable of doing have also taken quite a toll on my mental. Being cut from hockey tryouts, which is quite popular where I live, or the occasional bad grade on tests. I want to go to graduate school but school is so competitive now that my decently high gpa simply isn‚Äôt enough to be admitted into those graduate schools. 

I‚Äôve come to my very supportive mother about my problems she said she understands how I feel and suggested that I go to my doctor and explain my thoughts in hopes I will be prescribed something. I‚Äôve been taking medication my whole life; concerta, vyvance, wellbutrin, you name it. But I think to myself, is my lack of motivation/discipline really so easy to fix? Will taking a pill really lead me into becoming the person I have longed to be? There are people out there in far worse living conditions that im in yet some of them still find success and belonging even without all the expensive medication and therapy. 

So it all comes full circle to my question, how can I fix the way I currently am? Has anyone else had similar feelings and escaped this feeling of hopelessness? I truly do want to live up to both my own and my parents expectations but I‚Äôm simply unsure how to start. Maybe you guys could help me out.",159mulo,depression

Panic attacks every single day, constant thoughts of everything being meaningless, being too mentally/physically exhausted to do the things I want/need to do. My mom, best friend and brother are very supportive, which I of course appreciate and love them all very much, but the only person who can fix me is me. At times, I feel like my depression adds to theirs (they are all also depressed and dealing with very stressful situations in their lives) and all I ever do is bring everyone around me down. These thoughts worsten my depression even more, and so that leads me into my questions: Are there any therapy options for someone from a small town who has state-provided, low-income insurance? I have also been seeing a doctor for many years, but I feel like every time I see him he just pushes a new pill at me. Would it be a smart decision to be seen for a second opinion and be checked for other mental health disorders (i.e bipolar), or would my doctor take offense to a request like that?

I feel like my only hope would be therapy but that would require both a good therapist and me actually cooperating, which has proven difficult in the past. and even for that to be an issue I'd first have to actually be able to schedule an appointment and I just can't do it, and I have no one I can ask to do it for me.

I have a loving and supportive family, I'm not rich and spoil*t* but I do get spoiled in the sense that my family try to give me as much as they possibly can within their own limits. I'm so grateful and appreciative of it. I know I'm lucky.

I have seasonal depression so I have this war inside my head of being depressed for 6 months for no reason, and then feeling extremely happy and grateful for every small and big thing in my life for the other 6 months of the year. 

In my depressed half of the year, I always feel extremely guilty for being depressed because I don't have a necessarily difficult life. Not that I haven't had, and do have, hardships, but they're just not the reasons for my depression. Infact, there is no reason for my depression, it just always happens every autumn/winter anyways. And so I feel super guilty because I don't have a reason to justify my feelings.

615,07-25-2023,"I was in sophomore year of high school, at the time I already had pretty low self esteem, but I had some good friends that I was close with. I started to realize I had feelings for one of my close female friends, it took every single ounce of courage I could muster out of my body to ask her out, and I was ecstatic when she said yes.

Fast forward about a year, we've grown closer, spend more time together, every thing is going great. Now keep in mind we are both terribly introverted, and we still haven't kissed. One day my car was in the shop and my girlfriend had picked me up from work and I remember feeling so much love for her in that moment, and finally after a year of being in a relationship I mustered up all the courage i contained in my body again and i ask her if I could kiss her. Her response was ""I think that would be really awkward"". I remember being stunned, It felt like time stood still and I could hear her response echoing in my head. I got out of the car and walked to my front door which felt like an eternity as my brain was firing on all cylinders trying to rationalize what just happened. Eventually it came to the conclusion of ""why would anybody want to kiss you, you are an awkward loser. Nobody wants you around."" 

Its been 7 years since then and i haven't had anything close to a relationship since. A part of me died that day, what little self esteem I had left had shattered into a million pieces. I don't think it will ever come back.",159kct4,depression

17F | I know this might be more accurate to have posted this on the trauma subreddit but it won‚Äôt let me. I became very depressed and basically stopped living my life when I was 14. I haven‚Äôt really left the house since. I‚Äôm homeschooled and don‚Äôt have friends or anything. I‚Äôm getting better now but I think I might have stunted my growth or something. Guys my age look too old for me. Girls my age look way older then I feel I am. I see them online and still think of them like ""older girls"".
I FEEL more mature and I‚Äôm trying to accept adulthood as it‚Äôs coming but I still get sad sometimes. However the part I‚Äôm most concerned about is the fact that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm attracted to men my own age or want to hangout with girls my age. If guys my age look ""too old"" what if I‚Äôm still attracted to 14 year olds? I have no interaction with either so I can‚Äôt really confirm my theory/ anxiety but I hope so much that I‚Äôm wrong. Can I fix that if it is the case? I really don‚Äôt want to be like that.

But I am speaking sincerely - this is not an easy matter at all. I am immersed in anxiety and depression, I have stopped considering happiness as something real. In my opinion, happiness is just a myth, only a temporary analgesia of some fundamental dissatisfaction. It may sound cruel, but there are probably people for whom there is no way out.

Doing something I wanna do. But the waiting time until I know if this will work out is killing me... Because in the end it's my only way out. Rn I'm just sitting here not having accomplished anything. One of my best friends is going to fricking Oxford. My other best friend - I'm in love with him and he's amazing in every imaginable way and way further in live. Having a nice paying job, being socially competent, having lots of friends he's vacationing with. Being ambitious, making friends left and right. But he's obviously not into me.
My little brother is my families treasure by being really good at what he's doing. I'm just here - existing. But that's it.

I'm sitting here not being able to afford clothes, feeling really fucking lonely even within my small close friends group. Because either they have their own job as well, have rich parents and can afford actually living. And me being depressed all the time, not really being able to connect or have the energy to stay connected... I feel like I'm losing this friends group as well. Especially after I integrated my best friend. Everything has kinda shifted towards him.

Especially summer is hard, seeing all those happy people posting their stories on Instagram. Especially if it's people you were close with and depression and anxiety making me kill those friendships

The state of the world... Politics, climate change, more hostelity against gays... I don't even know what I'm working for in this world. Will I even be able to afford a house at some point?

I just hope so much that things finally work out in my favor at some point. If what I wanna study isn't working out... I don't know how I'll be able to find new friends. New positive outlooks on life. What I'll do with my life. 
So far life has only given me setbacks. My childhood and youth was taken. My happiness was taken. My friends were taken. And I can't figure a way out despite having been in therapy two times already.

I'm ambitious and generally think I have lots of potential. I always had a lot of skills when I was younger. Whatever I touched, I could do it. But I don't know where this me has gone. I've lost myself. I don't know who I am, because I actually thought I wouldn't be here at this point. Maybe I should've killed myself at 17.

I don't think I'm dumb or unattractive. At least that's what people tell me. But this damn depression has taken 10 years of my life. I hate myself so fucking much and I don't know what to do anymore.

Sorry, I know it‚Äôs a dark and touchy subject as it should be. But I just need somewhere to get this out. (I am not currently suicidal and do have a therapy appointment scheduled tomorrow). Little background. My ex girlfriend (F29)and I (M29) were together for 8 years. We knew each other since we were 4. We were close growing up ever since. Went our separate ways in the later years of high school, she dated I dated yadda yadda. Our sophomore year of college we got together. We went to very opposite colleges, her going to a hippy laid back place and me going to a military academy. But both in the same state so when I had leave, I was there every weekend. We grew together. She stayed with me during my little summer training ship experiences and I couldn‚Äôt wait for the day to see her when I got home after 3 months. Anyway, real world hit us upon graduation, she was going to grad school and I was the provider for the time. We got our own place and despite not being home for much of it I was paying the full rent and groceries, electric etc while she attended grad school.  We were just missing each other so much but I was there for the important things. Her graduation, her first job acceptance, and I was just so happy. Which led me to hating my job, so I applied high and low for something, anything that kept me close to her. Finally, got accepted to NYPD academy. Despite its current climate, massive pay cut and overall.. knowing it was a shitty job I happily went through with it. I had a side job while going through the academy on weekends, as well as herself while also working 5 days a week. So time together was limited. But I had a Sunday off and just wanted to finally stay in bed all day, she of course still had her side job. So I popped on our shared Hulu account on our shared Mac book and layed in bed. Upon watching idk 3 episodes of always sunny, a message popped up on the screen stating ‚ÄúI miss your body‚Äù it was an unknown number and to be honest I am not technologically savvy. She had linked her iMessage account to our laptop that I bought for just our apartment to do exactly what I was doing. (Didn‚Äôt have a tv in the bedroom) I looked through past conversations with this person, and they were having sex multiple times a week while I was on my last ship knowing I was coming home to start the academy. I texted her while she was at work just stating that we needed to talk when you get a second. And she called me immediately, I asked her who this person was and was immediately met with anger. She came home two hours later and it was a fight as soon as she walked in for going through her private messages. I left that night and stayed with a nearby friend. Going through a range of emotions, hurting and feeling a pain I‚Äôve never ever wish on my worst enemy. She didn‚Äôt know at the time but I had the engagement ring locked up at my parents house and was proposing that following week. Scheduled the photographer to be disguised and all. I probed her further while we were apart and when she was angry she shared even more. The sex was better, she‚Äôs been with multiple guys and girls whenever I was away. Things I just had no clue of. It was happening while we were still in college. This led to me ending things with her. Kicking her out of our home we‚Äôve lived in together for 3 years. I helped her dad pack her things into his car, and hugged her goodbye. Now I was in the academy still. Had to show up and with only a month left my casual drinking once or twice a week on date night led to a bottle of tequila to myself as soon as I got home. My funds were running low and the pay was not great. As soon as they issued our service weapons I put the gun to my mouth and wanted to end it all while still in the academy in a porta potty at the shooting range. I was a full blown alcoholic and I realized that. I didn‚Äôt pull the trigger of the weapon, but I pulled the trigger on admitting it to myself and I resigned the following day, went to detox safely in a hospital right after. Upon that I was lost, I had no job for the first time since I was 14. I had no girlfriend for the first time since I was 19. I sublet my apartment to a friend and moved back with my parents and slept on the couch for months. I sold my car to pay off bills I have accrued. And she would email me to meet her. Or I would email her. We both had each other blocked on everything since it was so toxic and I would say mean cruel things when I was drinking. As would she. But it was to meet up for car sex. If she didn‚Äôt want it when I did she would brag about how she has a new person, if I couldn‚Äôt meet up with her when she wanted she would say okay I‚Äôll just text the other guy. Anyway, that went on for two years. Me working side jobs and little things just to get by. Now I am back working with the government making more money than I ever have or have the need for. But I‚Äôm alone, I haven‚Äôt been home or seen family or friends since January. I have odd hours, and I‚Äôm just so alone. It put me in a spiral months back. But I didn‚Äôt not start drinking again. I worked out, I was still in the best shape of my life until 2 months ago. When a girl we both knew told me to start dating again because she‚Äôs posting pictures with a new guy. I went to the liquor store the second I got off my watch. And I went right back to that ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt have a shot now I‚Äôll be shaking and be obvious for this operation meeting‚Äù at 0700. But I don‚Äôt have the courage to ask for help physically only mentally. But I do have a firearm on my hip and stopping the whirlwind in my head sounds a lot better and appealing to me than having my clearance taken away and an investigation started when I go back to detox.

639,07-25-2023,"Wasn‚Äôt sure where to ask this because most subs don‚Äôt allow questions about suicide so I‚Äôm posting here. 

Maybe a stupid question but I‚Äôve always wondered what exactly doctors/therapists mean when you tell them you‚Äôre having suicidal thoughts and they ask you if you have a plan. I‚Äôve thought about asking my therapist but I‚Äôve always been too afraid of accidentally saying the wrong thing and making her think I‚Äôm a danger to myself and reporting it. I‚Äôm not currently suicidal but I have been in the past never to the point of actually attempting but had strong suicidal thoughts and ideation and started seriously considering suicide as an option and came up with a plan of sorts but didn‚Äôt actually attempt to carry it out. 

So I guess my question is at what point in making your suicide plan does it cross over from just suicidal thoughts to actually ‚Äúhaving a plan‚Äù? Like my ‚Äúplan‚Äù involved knowing the exact method I would use and all details of how I would go about it but I never actually picked a date to do it or started changing things in my life to prepare for my suicide because I never had the intention to actually carry it out right then it was just a hypothetical for if/when I did get to a point where I would carry it out in the future. And I guess I view it as a backup plan of sorts now (again I am not currently suicidal) but like my attitude towards my suicidal thoughts has definitely changed since I‚Äôve come up with my plan like the idea of committing suicide seems a lot more real to me now and seems like I would be more capable of doing it now that I have a plan than before when I didn‚Äôt have a plan. So does that constitute ‚Äúhaving a plan‚Äù when my therapist asks me that question or does having a plan just mean specifically having a day or general time picked out and having the intention to carry out the plan asap. 

Another issue I have when trying to answer this question from my therapist when I‚Äôm having suicidal thoughts is if my plan really does constitute as ‚Äúhaving a plan‚Äù in the way therapists mean when they ask that question then like I will always have a plan for the rest of my life because I can‚Äôt just un-have my plan. Like whether I‚Äôm feeling suicidal or not the plan will always be in the back of my mind now that I‚Äôve come up with it. And of course whenever I‚Äôm having suicidal thoughts I think of my plan even if I have no intention of carrying it out. And like I said ever since I‚Äôve come up with this plan my attitude towards suicide has changed drastically and I feel much more capable of actually committing suicide in the future now even if I don‚Äôt have the intention to carry out this plan immediately. So do you think my ‚Äúplan‚Äù is what therapists are asking about when they ask people if they have a plan or does it only count if you have a time picked out and have the intention of carrying out the plan immediately? Also regardless of whether or not my plan is what therapists mean when they are asking if you have a plan would it be safe to tell my therapist about the fact that I have this sort of plan without her having to report it?

640,07-25-2023,"TW: abuse mention  
Just over a year ago now, one of my best friends got dumped from a pretty serious relationship. They already struggled with depression, and the way they got dumped certainly didn't help (it was really messed up). For a few months, things were really bad, but then they started to look up. For the last six months, though, they've just been spiraling downwards. Their therapist's big piece of advice (before they stopped going to therapy) was to find happiness in being single. My friend hasn't listened to this at all, really, and although it feels mean to even say, I feel like they're blaming a lot of their problems on not having a partner. My other best friend and I agree that things are bad, and we need to talk to them, but we're all apart for the summer so we need to wait two months so we can have that conversation in person.  
My friend's stopped reaching out for help now, and I only find out that rough stuff has been going on with them via vent posts on their twitter alt or vent DMs. I'm so worried about them, since they've talked about feeling the worst they have in a while and like they have no one. The problem is, it's been getting harder and harder to be there for them, because they keep lashing out at me. They've said some shit where, had not been best friends for years previously, I would have never fucking spoken to them again. The worst was when they made a joke about my biggest insecurity and about me being emotionally/verbally abused by my soccer coach to the point where I was psychologically devastated (I am doing far better now, thankfully, it's been years and I've been able to heal). Every time I try to reach out beyond ""oh that sucks"", they blow up at me. One time they even told me there ""wasn't a magic set of words I could say to fix them"". Another time, they said that my other best friend and I can't really be there for them for support since it's a platonic relationship and ""it's just different.""  
Besides from that, they've been really mean to me in general recently, and my other best friend and I agree that my friend always gets angrier at me even when I've done nothing wrong. They also seem to always start from the assumption that I'm wrong, and I've learned it's easier to just give in, even when I know for a fact that I'm right, because otherwise they get really heated.  
The worst part for me at least is that I've had to start masking around them. I tried it for the first time on a night where I was already doing rough enough to listen to my self-destructive thoughts, and it worked. For the first time in weeks, we hung out for a whole night without them getting mad at me. I hate doing it but I can't stop because it's the one thing that lets me pretend things are back to the way they were. I call this mask the ""smile and nod"", since I just don't talk except to agree with them. They haven't even noticed I've been acting differently.  
I just don't know what to do anymore. It feels like there's this pit in my heart where all the care I felt for them used to be. I want to help them but they refuse to let me and then they rant about how they feel like they have no one and how lonely they are. I want to take them by the shoulders and just scream into their face that I'm here!!!! I'm trying to be!!!! And you're the one that won't let me!!!! It just makes me so angry and then I get upset with myself for being angry because my friend is struggling and it's probably wrong to daydream about finally getting to stand up for myself and scream at them for the way they've treated me. It's just become so fucking hard to care about them because every time I try to help they hurt me but it feels horrible to say. Any advice would be more than welcome, I feel completely lost.",158zxto,depression

644,07-25-2023,"Hello. I am making this post not becouse I want anything in return, I just want to spill my emotions here, since I have no one to talk to.

I am not going to bore you with my story or my problems with my parents, love life, social problems, job problems or any other problems I have, or how i got to this point. Instead I will get straight to the point.

I hate my life with a passion and if I continue like this something bad is going to happen. The hatred is getting stronger with each day and all I want is just to end it all finally. The only regret I have is that I havent ended sooner. I have nothing in my life that gives me a reason to live. I already know how im going to do it and where, the problem is the time. 

I have a job, where I help people. I don't want to scar or disappoint the people I am helping right now, also they need me to help them. It sucks, a person like me, who can't fix himself has to fix others. But it doesn't matter, I have to help. I am not that selfish. But once they don't need me, I am free to do as I please.

My friends don't understand. One of them doesn't understand me and is also afraid of me (well, afraid of my depression), whenever I start to talk about my feelings on life. The other is here for me and worried, but has his own problems. I have no other friends, and the love of my life left. I have nothing, nothing matters to me, I feel empty.

I could go all night here typing everything, but the point is, there is no other person I hate more than myself. A worthless, pitiful, unloved, lonely, unsuccessful, untalented piece of garbage. And it's all my fault. I HAVE GIVEN UP and all I wait is for the time to be right. And now I wait,... Belive me no one will be there for me, no one will care and the people that will care, will only care for their image or themselves.

647,07-25-2023,"M(21) here, I've lost all the joy I've had in life, I have no friends, havent had any since 2015, dont know how to make friends, I have no girlfriend, I'm extremely socially awkward and anxious and I've been severely depressed for the past 2.5 years, and if i had the courage to end myself i wouldve done it a long time ago, but i cant do it, no one except me knows how I feel. For the past 8 years I've done absolutely nothing except procrastinating at home and being on my phone or pc all day long and this is due to high school where I was seen as a weird kid because I just was very introverted and had nothing in common with anyone, plus I had zero social awareness and knowledge about anything. All of this together gave me zero motivation in me and caused me to not go out at all and now i dont feel confident about me at all. I also have 0 fashion sense, and im from a family that wasnt always the best financially so i cant spend stuff on anything. 

I've been to 2 therapists, and its just so useless, I was better off not going at all since the advice that I got was really weak. I've finished uni in like 5 july this month and since then ive done absolutely nothing, just being on phone and pc at home all day and i hate this and want to stop this but dont know how, i have absolutely no one, i have 0 social skills i just want to have a group of people and to be liked without being judged. I dont go to clubs or anywhere, the only time i leave the house its to get food or sometimes clothes (which happens like twice a year). I just fucking hate that its gonna be another summer for the 1000th time in a row where i cant do anything due to my social anxiety, im even afraid to get a job (in uni sometimes I used to not attend courses just to avoid social contact and i hate myself for this). I have mood swings multiple times a day and sometimes it gets so bad that i cant even listen to music because of the depression. Because of all of this my diet is also really bad, I might have serious health issues in the future if i dont stop but i have 0 motivation. I also still live with my parents and it feels like living in a prison, i only procrastinate all day and I would be so sure that if i move out my life could change a lot.

On top of all of this I still have trauma from high school, where i used to get bullied sometimes and was the only one there that didnt have any friends, my colleagues thought i have mental issues but it was just social anxiety and that affected me a lot. I cant stop thinking about high school and every single day I keep having negative thoughts about it. I really want to dm someone from highschool which ive trusted a long time ago and talk to them but im afraid theyre gonna talk behind my back or judge me once again, plus im not sure if its a good idea to do this since it would be awkward and it would put me in a bad position.

Only things that could motivate right now are a group of friends, a girlfriend, a high paying job, or moving out and none will happen in the near future.

Feeling guilty, worthless. I know if I could get a little motivation and get some stuff done, I'd probably feel a lot better. 

My depression and anxiety make me a bad father. I shut off from everyone, just go through the motions. I guess at least I'm there. 

I've been drinking too much. It's the only thing that makes me feel better but ultimately makes me feel worse. It's not even noon yet and I'm very tempted to have my first drink but I have to drive the kids in a little bit. 

A friend texted me a song this morning - nothing special - but I went down a rabbit hole of the artist (punk band but was also a professional athlete) and I was simultaneously jealous, bitter, and discouraged that someone could do so much exciting stuff with their life. I was always good at everything, but never the best. I know I should be grateful I have what I have - which is a ton - but I ended up in a normal job and never accomplished anything really worthwhile in my eyes. 

I'm turning 40 soon which I'm sure isn't helping. I'm very sad to see my parents aging and they are both very unhappy and stuck in very unhealthy patterns and behaviors they've been stuck in for many years. I'm always worried about something happening to my kids. I really don't care if I die but they would be so completely devastated that I know I have to keep going on. 

I know it seems every generation feels this way at some point, but I really feel like we're in bad times with little optimism for where we're headed. 

I make decent money and, compared to the average American, I have a great job with very good work/life balance. But my wife and I keep consuming, buying stuff, for those little spikes of dopamine. Of course, it works for a short while and then I start looking at our finances and realizing it's unsustainable and we will need to make a change at some point. We have a significant amount of debt but a large amount of savings  (3x the debt), so we always are just like, ""Well, worst case scenario, we can dip into savings to catch up.""

I'm terribly unhealthy but don't look it and my labs just came back and everything is normal. At least if things appeared to not be going well on paper, I might be motivated to make a change. In addition to the drinking, I just subsist on crap I shove into my face to make me feel a little better. 

I'm pretty new at my job or else I would call in sick on a day like today, maybe take a few days off. I have good benefits/time off so I guess at least I have that to look forward to once I've been here awhile longer.

In the past, I've gotten so low that I sort of break out of the depression. Like everything becomes so utterly meaningless that the weight of any sense of responsibility or duty just dissolves and I feel sort of at peace. I don't know how to get to that point.

The last two men have told me the same thing, ‚ÄúNo spark‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo connection‚Äù. This is after multiple dates and months of talking. On the outside I am bubbly, fun, exciting, warm, friendly, and emotionally vulnerable and open. I have worked soooo hard to be happy. It feels like a full time job sometimes.

I was diagnosed with depression in 8th grade and by some weird coincidence Covid-19 hit about 2 months later which obviously made things worse. I spent the rest of 8th grade online, spent my freshman year online and then had to go from in person to online again my sophomore year due to medical reasons which I'm still struggling with. Im supposed to go into my senior year and now I have to switch back to online due to my medical struggles. I'm not ready to go to college scene my whole high school career has been thrown away but I feel pressured to go right out of highschool.

I've been tested for every muscular/neurological diseases/conditions under the sun and I still am left without answers. I'm in constant pain and haven't been acivite in almost 2 years. My mom always seems frustrated with me and my dad just doesn't care. I can't sleep at night due to night sweats and I get scolded for being tired. I used to be able to talk to me mom about my problems but ever since she started showing frustration I don't because most of the time I hear ""suck it up"".

I had an extreme mental breakdown one time and was taken to the ER by mother. I was taken to the psych ward but wasn't admitted because I didn't seem serve enough. I'm suicidal and it's so obvious but my parents show no attention to it. In fact my dad got angry when I had my breakdown.

I want to die but I'm too scared to take any action because I'm too scared and it makes me hate myself even more. I think the only reason i'm still here is because of my dog. I'm tired, I'm ill, I'm depressed and I don't know what to do anymore.",159bdlu,depression

680,07-25-2023,"Hi im not very used to this ive never really posted anything on reddit before so bare with me please, also this is likely going to be a long rant over the past couple years. I'm preston, I am a almost 17 year old M and by how my life has been I really have no clue what the point to continue is. Now by all means I do have a blessed life with working and loving parents, compared to some people who live in abusive homes and places with no money or food this story doesnt even deserve to be read. But I feel as if i am alone in this world, my family to me is broken apart. My sister who is the oldest and my favorite sibling has moved out and doesnt contact us much which i get she is living her own life but I really miss her sometimes. My brother who is autistic (he is very well functioning but needs extra help) we live in the same home but it still feels as we're distant. We dont talk much or have a whole lot in common, he is more of a online person than I am loves video games always glued to his phone, I like cars, sports, video games and stuff too just not as much as him.  
  
I dont really have a relationship with my parents other than them being ""parents"" if that makes sense. I can only see them as parents and many times my dad has made it clear with the words ""we arent your friends"". He also doesnt believe in any mental health and makes a bunch of jokes about theres nothing to be depressed about especially in my life which I would typicially just akwardly laugh off. So with that I dont talk to them alot or do we go out to do stuff like alot of other families would. I dont mind this too much when I'm busy at work or something which I have grown to love doing just because it gets me out of the house away from family. I like my job serving at a restraunt because I get to talk to some cool people that sometimes make my day a little bit better and my coworkers are all cool people and i get paid while doing it. But it does hurt sometimes seeing happy couples just do couple stuff together and seem so happy with themselves. (yes i am jealous of it)  
  
My friends are in a rough spot too, the friendI usually text all the time just stops answering me and leaving me on delivered all the time even though we aren't dating or anything. I do have one person I text at night and stuff but thats about it, everyone else is kinda like the people you see every once in a while. I dont really hang out too much with people honestly I dont even know the answer to why myself, im not the most talkative person but also not too akward either. Just going out with people seems just like idk the word to put for it, but I often go out to eat and stuff just by myself and find it somewhat enjoyable.  
  
I tried dating or at least talking to this one girl who I was obsessed with (not in a weird way). After a while I decided to try and talk to her and things were going great after a rough start, we were texting all night to early morning. Walking eachother to classes and just walking a talking, her personality was the cutest and she loved cars like I did and she got me in to sport bikes too which i still love now. I felt as if my life was at the best its ever been, I decided to ask her out to go eat and walk around this popular place in our city and it was fine until the first time shes said something with work popped up an hour or so before we went. At first I was like oh okay, thats fine theres always another time, then a couple weeks later I tried again and she left me sitting in the restraunt and never responded until a long time later. That was one of the worst nights of my life, I was really close driving myself into a pillar on the highway. I still have no answer to why I swerved away at the last second but i'm still here. after like 3 months she just sends me cat pictures i assume just to mess with me? That just made it even worse, then seeing her walking with another guy at the end of the school year just made me feel horrible, I dont get what was wrong with me but yeah thats my girl story.  
  
After that night I think I fell into depression for months, I ended up quitting baseball which ive been playing since I was 2 in a heartbeat, I stopped talking to people at school, stopped doing things i enjoyed like video games and I would just sleep and cry all the time, lots of suicidal thoughts too. This was maybe 6 or 7 months ago, jump to now I am doing a little bit better I am still obsessed with her and I dont know why or how to stop it. I havent talked to any girls since I dont really find too much confidence in myself mostly cause of my hieght or maybe i have trust issues I dont really know. Alot of times I just see a lot of girls I find very pretty and just think ""wow shes pretty"" and turn and walk away.  
  
I was able to revive my love for baseball and I think right now thats the only thing from keeping me depressed again. Right now i have no goals for my life no motavation to do anything really other than get a 5.0 mustang (pretty sad life goal ik). I dont really know what Im going to do in college or to do with a career, I dont have an issue with having to have a career job just nothing seems like something I would want to do and not have the average depressed man office job.  
  
At this point its just me venting because i havent said most of this to anyone over like 2 years so why not random internet strangers.

My journey has been almost like a scientific experiment.  I tried a whole lotta different things, in terms of lifestyle choices and attitude, and then evaluated what worked and what didn't.  I had some very pleasant successes.  I also had some quite painful setbacks.  Either way, every month I would report back to my counselor on my progress and get his feedback.

Basically, I had to take risks.  I had to put myself out there.  I had to try new things.  That's hard.  But I was determined to make the effort and do whatever it takes.

I had so many ups and downs, but over the past year I really have started turning the corner.  I got into local community theater.  I just auditioned for a lead role in an upcoming show and got the part.  It's not Broadway or Hollywood, but it's good enough to make me happy.

I too also deal with depression but hers right now is more severe. She's been feeling very down for months now, pretending to be happy in front of our friends, finds no joy in her usual hobby of gaming, and says she just wants to die but doesn't actually want to kill herself. 

I understand these emotions and I try to validate her. I try to make sure she understands how important and wonderful she is. I never know what to say when she says she's depressed. I just say something like ""I'm sorry I know it sucks really badly, I'm here for you and with you. I'm not going anywhere. You're important and deserve happiness."" I deal with my own issues right now on my own since I know she can't handle anything extra right now. I love her and I want a future with her so I want to know if there's any extra way to support her in her time of need.

I know I won't be the one to overall help her figure out how to fight against her depression. She herself has to take the steps and I can only suggest things. She's looking into therapy despite not liking it the first time she tried it years ago.

I have spent the 3 years since learning how to manage my illness without medication. After all, I‚Äôve tried therapy with numerous drugs and it has not been successful.

So, the last 3 years has been difficult. Learning to build a life outside of the anxieties of holding yourself together. You feel like a bomb. The simplest slip of habits and structured schedule will spiral into a decision making disaster. Then you‚Äôre NOT ok. But luckily I‚Äôve gotten back on track. Until now.

I turned 21. My friends are older, and so naturally I go to some bars. I was not interested in alcohol until I tasted the pure extract of dance clubs under a cocktail deep drunkenness.

I then crashed my car (sober!). Then the next day my old manager fell off a mountain and died. A family friend diagnosed with terminal cancer. My best friend thinking I talk all about myself. All of this is mania. I don‚Äôt know when and what went wrong but now I don‚Äôt sleep and relapsed on cocaine last night.

I don‚Äôt want to seek care because I don‚Äôt want to be defeated. I must prove to everyone and myself that if I try hard enough I can manage this into a highly functional state. I just want to be myself.

Medication never made me feel like myself. It made me feel sad that bipolar has defeated me. I feel the desperation of creativity stricken ex with my simple thought processes. I don‚Äôt like medications because they change who I am.

But what do I do when I don‚Äôt have a home, a broken car, no money, parents in another state, bipolar disorder, and this significantly permanent commitment to learning how to conque bipolar. As long as this exists, my ego is fighting wars with my disease. I don‚Äôt know how to fix this. I just want to be stronger than bipolar.

I feel like nothing, like less than nothing.
I‚Äôm thinking I could make these poems and write how I‚Äôm feeling. 
But it‚Äôs not helping. All I‚Äôm doing is writing down things that I‚Äôd never tell anyone.
I hate it and it fucking hurts man it does.
I can‚Äôt help but cry. I‚Äôm crying as I write this. I‚Äôm tired of hurting.
I want it all to go away.
I want to stop hurting. 
And what‚Äôs worse is that I can‚Äôt tell anyone anymore than what I‚Äôve already told them. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs so many different layers to it. 
Like I‚Äôve only told people the tip of the iceberg, and I‚Äôm afraid if I tell them more, it‚Äôll only ruin their life. They‚Äôd have to worry about coming to  my rescue because I‚Äôm so helpless.

I‚Äôm scared of dying or becoming numb. But at this point it feels like pick your poison.

Writing to no particular person for no particular purpose. 
Sitting in this empty room with nothing but a tv, my cat, and my thoughts.
It‚Äôs sort of become like an everyday routine now. 
I go through the day doing whatever. Then I come home. 
And when the lights go off and the house goes silent, I‚Äôm stuck here. Stuck in this empty room with nothing but this void. 
The void I have instead of a heart. 
It feels like torture. 
Being left alone to my thoughts.
To my misery.
To my loneliness.
I feel like I‚Äôm trapped in a state of limbo. 
I can‚Äôt decide if I want to tell everyone what‚Äôs REALLY going on.
Or if I want to just suffer in silence. 
Honestly it‚Äôs probably one of the hardest things to have to decide. 
To me it is.
If I tell everyone, I‚Äôm scared that they feel like they‚Äôll have to drop everything and come to my rescue. ‚ÄúOh look, _______ is going through something. Let‚Äôs ignore what we have going on and coddle him.‚Äù Like I‚Äôm some damsel in distress.
That‚Äôs not all though. I feel like I can‚Äôt even tell because I will:
A. Feel like I‚Äôm being a burden
B. Because everyone else is busy with their own lives to think about me
C. I‚Äôm not ready. I‚Äôm not strong enough.
Then on the other hand I don‚Äôt want to hold this in because I feel like it‚Äôs killing me. I feel like I‚Äôm suffering. Like I‚Äôm being tortured with my own mental state. 
I‚Äôm tired. 
And I don‚Äôt like it here. 
I wanna go home.

No one cares. No one actually cares.
If they did then why am I still alone? Why am I still hurting? 
Why do I feel like everyone‚Äôs abandoned me?
Why am I still there for others? Knowing I won‚Äôt receive that same concern. I‚Äôm done avoiding it. I‚Äôm done denying it. 
Everything would be so much better, so much easier‚Ä¶.

If I was gone. There‚Äôs no need for me to be here anymore. I have no place in this world. At this point I feel like everything that‚Äôs holding me back isn‚Äôt working. I love my family dearly and it pains me that I contemplate leaving this world and them behind.

718,07-25-2023,"Hello Redditors,
Please note this post is going to be long, deep and dark 

A little introduction. My name is J, I'm a 32 years old from Tennessee. I'm going through something and it's scaring me. 

It all starts in 1996 when I was 5 years old living in Severance, CO. The earliest memories I can recall was me being diagnosed with ADHD(after researching,  I should of been diagnosed with autism) and prescribed Ritalin at fuckin 5 years old. Personally I think Ritalin and later on Adderall changed my brain chemicals for the worse in my later years.

Anyway,  I remember playing hockey with the neighborhood kids just being a normal kid and then all of a sudden in 2000 my parents lost their job because their microchip  plant closed down. We moved from Colorado to Washington State. We lived in Washington for a year and a half. Once again their plant in Washington closed down and we moved back to Colorado. Then after another year and a half in Colorado we moved to Tennessee in 2002,  this is when shit starts to go down hill.

My parents had me in ""special ed"" from 4th grade into the end of middle school. Looking back I feel like I was being held back both socially and educationally. Fast forward to high school, my father was basically absent for my teenage years(so all the things about relationships, dating, sex, ect I didn't learn until I was an early adult)because he was a truck driver and was gone 3 to 4 weeks at a time. When he would be home, all he would do was sleep and go right back out. I understand why he did it, it was to support 2 kids and a wife. 

In 2004 he had a severe mental breakdown and was permanently mentally disabled and living with him was a nightmare from 2004 to 2010 when I joined the Army.

Ontop of that my mother was a helicopter parent to the point where she kept an eye on me all the fuckin time. So that means all my teens, I never went to prom or any house parties to learn social skills. I only 
had one friend(still friends to this day) throughout my high school days and was never social. Deep down I absolutely hate my parents on how they raised me because I'm suffering from their bad parenting now. This has lead me down a path of no dates, no girlfriend, no substantial relationship, and flat out suffering.

Present day I have a good paying job and have my own house, which my mom lives with and pays rent. However what I'm missing is a  romantic relationship. I am struggling every fuckin day to keep going. I have everything I could want, except for a significant other. The loneliness is literally eating me away to the point of just checking out. 

Also I feel like I'm fucked in the head because at 32, I shouldn't  be socially inept but here I am. I don't know how to interact with women, let alone try to be romantically involved. 
I tried all the dating apps and I got one match which led to a few dates but it fizzled out. I even set the radius to 70 miles and still no replies. I don't send women creepy messages, I send them thoughtful messages about their interests. Maybe I'm just unattractive.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

 I live in a small town and there's nothing to do therefore I just sit in my gaming room and play video games on the weekend, it's the only thing that brings me peace. 

To wrap up, I'm scared that eventually I will find myself checking out. I cry every night at work because I just think when I get home, I  don't come home to a S/O. Maybe this is just a valley for me at my stage of life, but god damn I can't stand the thought of going another 40 years living like the way I am.

&#x200B;

hi everyone,

i am 26 (f) and i was diagnosed with clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder three years ago after an extremely stressful life event, and since then it's been hell. i've been getting treatment with meds (sertraline) and psychotherapy twice a week, but i'm honestly losing any hopes i used to have.

my life is just upside down at the moment. i got back to my home country after a frustrated immigration attempt with my ex-partner; i got fired from my last job which provided me really good financial conditions due to ""performance"" (aka depression) issues; i do not want to go outside or reach out to people who call themselves my friends (but who never reach out to me); i force myself to eat at least one meal a day but it only happens after huge efforts and i usually have no pleasure in doing it; i am currently enrolled in an mba in which i can't even think of because i don't know if i'll be able to keep paying for it in the next few months. i am currently renting a flat but will probably lose it if i don't get a job soon (in like two weeks lmfao), and i have no place to go back to if i lose it. don't even need to mention i feel lonely as f\*ck and have no romantic partners (and not interested in looking for any as i've been despising people in general). i've practically inverted my sleep routine as i feel less miserable during the evening, but i feel guilty about it as it may cause even more consequences to mental and physical health. waking up and sleeping early has just always been alien to me and i could never stick to it for longer than a few weeks tops, and i always end up feeling frustrated and sh\*tty after another failed attempt to do something that is apparently so important.

i lost most of my friendships from the past after i found out they were never my friends but rather my ex-partner's friends and i have no energy (or the means, as i no longer have social circles like school or work) to make new friends, so just i reach out to the few ones i still have but they don't seem to correspond in a way i would like them to due to \~\~adulting, or at least they don't consider me as much their friend as i do consider them, which is quite sad.

and i just tried so so so many things to get better. from sports (mostly swimming and running) to spirituality (all sorts of mystical bs you can think of), which are things people always recommend for those who are depressed. but i feel guilty when i am not motivated to keep doing any kind of physical activity, because it feels like i am not helping myself to get better. i actually loved taking dance classes, i consider myself a dancer since i was a kid and i've performed on stage so many times before and i really loved it, but i can't do it anymore because i have ridiculously low self-esteem. i love music, i love singing and i love reading, but these are no longer helping me feel less miserable as they used to.

it's just so frustrating to tell people (my parents) i've actually tried all of those things but never felt better and to have them telling me i need to try harder, that i didn't try enough, or that i did it but in a wrong way... i understand that we can't cure depression but actually learn how to live with it, but it is just exhausting that i end up questioning why should i continue to exist.

my days just go by in a weird hazey feeling while i watch or play something, i feel just so disconnected from reality and from people around me, and i just do not know what to try anymore. i feel like giving up on trying to better things even though this is something i hate admitting. how have you been coping lately? what have you been doing? is something working for you atm? let's share experiences and hopefully feel a bit less lonely in this spiral of sh\*t.

So yeah here I am now nearly a year into this job and I hate it. I fuxking hate it. I fuxking hate how I switched majors like 3 times to land on a field that makes me want to kill myself . I fucking hate all this money and time I wasted just to be miserable. I have all this debt,own nothing , and now I‚Äôm in a job that literally caused me to go on medication.

I don't enjoy anything now. Full stop. Things are either boring, or not boring. I used to love video games, but they feel like a waste of time now. I still play them though, because it helps me to forget about my unfulfilling life.

I thought it was going to get better, and it did...for a bit. Now it's significantly worse.

I hope this doesn't last, but something tells me it will. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't see a way out, or how anything is going to help me.

728,07-25-2023,"I have another post on the confessions reddit I made 4 months ago. I am a recent graduate with decent grades. But my life has always been shit, moving from hotel to motel, living in apartments in the ghettos. I barley had a father figure, let alone a good life. I'm the youngest of 3 kids and our family doesn't have the best social skills of our feelings.

Recently an old lady me and my mother(we are homeless and trying to get an apartment) use to live woth falled the cops on us, and this old woman is a manipulative, narcissistic liar amd she gets away from it due to her age. Her son is a felon who still does illegal things such as thievery and forgery(reasons he went to prison). Me and my mother cannot go and get our stuff without calling cops to supervise us, but we only get 1 time and 15 minutes to get all out things from out room.

I have a small dog, 4 years old, and I am living with my grandmother, aunt and uncle. I cannot take my dog with me because their dog was raised during covid and is high anxiety and will harass my small dog. I have bad depression already from my father dying in 2021, and everything was just bad from there. I am autistic with ADHD, and my mind overthinks of all things thay can go wrong with my mother trying to survive off the streets with my brother and dog.

That dog is my whole world, but we are trying to find her fosters but I fear this will be the last time I'll see her. It's so hot in Arizona and she can die from being in a car from the heat. I don't know how much longer I can take this constant cycle of losing everything again. I want to end it all but my friends and boyfriend keep me going. And something in me wants me to keep going to. But I'm so tired, I'm so worn out and I don't see a light at the end of this void like tunnel. I want to run away and jump off a high way near by, but my family would only suffer more. I just want to leave, I didn't ask for a life like this where I lose everything again and again.

I'm so tired of trying, I disassociate to my phone. I just wish everything was a bad dream, but none of my wishes come true, even if I work hard for them I seem to always get nothing. I just want to end it all like I should have when I had the chance.",158zl7n,depression

735,07-25-2023,"I have been so depressed lately, about 2 months ago, from today actually, that's convenient. Anyway, on May 24th I lost my Best Friend (not death but they left me) and I live in Washington and They (non-binary person so they pronouns) live in Iowa so can't really talk it out. Rather not get into a whole story on how we met but short term, we met through a videogame and we've been friends for 8 or 9 months.  


But, it hurt my heart to the core when I arrived home and saw that they had unfriended me on Discord (our main talking platform) and they had a privacy setting on so there was no texting back. May 24th was a great and terrible day. I think it was the hardest day for me because I was forced to let go of my friend. I was forced to let go and I didn't want to. I know why they left now, it took me time to realize. But ever since we met, maybe a month into our friendship, I fell in love with them, their voice was soothing, I loved their laugh and I loved to make them laugh. And I loved their personality. Sorry, getting off track, I think (because I can't confirm this) but they left me because I told them I liked them. But when I said that, we were going through a rough patch and I could see that no matter what I did or said, they would leave me, it felt inevitable and I have always wanted to tell them, but was so scared to, so the stupidest part of me, sent a text, saying that. and presto, 2 or 3 days later, poof, gone.  


But now, I just now miss them, they were the reason I was so happy, I used to be happy when I received a text with their name on it. I used to check up on them everyday to make sure they were doing good, and now that their gone, my phone has never been more silent. Our friendship wasn't the best, it was pretty bad actually, but I rather have a bad friendship than none, because with a type of friendship, we could have grown and be better, but now, I can't even talk to them anymore.  


I really miss my Best Friend, I don't think I'll ever make a friend again in a while. And to be honest, I just want a Girlfriend, just someone who can love me, because I feel like I can give all my love to a person, but no one tries for me. I want to be loved is all. And for a time, I really hoped that it could have been my Best Friend. I am not going to put my heart out there again or at least for a long time.

736,07-25-2023,"I am clinically depressed and have a psychiatrist who has prescribed me a plethora of medication for my depression and anxiety. Eventually, I was at the maximum dose for lexapro (20mg), and that STILL wasn‚Äôt working. I‚Äôm addition, I have also tried Wellbutrin (didn‚Äôt last long because i had an allergic reaction). I have now been put on a different antidepressant. I had always felt like they never really did anything for my thoughts nor improving quality of life.
So now my dr switches me from lexapro to Prozac and tells me to lower my dose to 10mg for three days and then start taking the new meds. Well after those three days, I stopped taking my meds entirely and that‚Äôs when things started to go south.
I am in a constant state of anxiety and this feeling of being on edge. I feel like I am hallucinating sometimes but when I look again there‚Äôs nothing there. I‚Äôve spent hundreds if not almost a grand on impulse spending and I‚Äôve been engaging in wreck-less behavior + substance abuse. I have done everything from oxy,30s, Xanax, muscle relaxers, and sleeping pills and if I am being honest right now I am out of it. Ugh and not only impulse spending but decisions in general that are generally unpredictable and often put me sketchy places (and losing money smh).

I am definitely at my lowest point in my life right now and I feel so pathetic for being trapped in this state. I have had a pretty traumatic past and a lot of recent trauma as well. 

(This next part is fairly sad and could be triggering for some. I don't exactly know how to list what triggers could be affected, so I figured I would just have a catch all warning. Skip the next paragraph if you have past trauma and don't want to risk a PSTD trigger or something) 

Several of my family members have died. I have died before and was brought back at birth which jacked up my a bunch of stuff with my body, mind, etc. I have been severally bullied, have had friends betray me several times (one even staged a suicide just to mess with me). I have been beat, stabbed, electrocuted, and verbally abused. Me and my family also got severe Covid that almost killed me, and really messed up my dad. He was in the ICU for 6 months, died twice, was brought back twice, and now is permanently messed up from it (at least he survived though). There is more but it hurts to think back and I don't want to anymore. Sorry for trauma dumping like this but I am hoping that sharing with people might give some help or something. 

So now in my life I feel incredibly isolated and have a hard time connecting with people or trusting them. My mental health has gotten worse and I have had flashbacks and intrusive thoughts about the past. I feel shackled by it and I do not know how to move past it. Everything hurts and I feel so weak. I used to be able to take physical hits and be fine, but now my body just shuts down if someone raises their voice at me. I truly and honestly hate myself. I feel so tired and I just want my past to disappear. I wish I could just wake up and be happy with friends and family, but the thought of a future like that seems so distant and impossible at this point. 

I don't really know what the point of writing this was. If someone reads this and they feel like they can relate, I guess that is something. If anyone wants to talk about their struggles with depression, anxiety, trauma, or anything else, feel free to message me. 

Final Note: If anyone responds to this, thank you. Just knowing people read it kinda makes me feel a bit better. Feel free to message like I said before. However, this is an alt I made, so if I take a while to respond to messages or something, don't take it personal. I'm not ignoring, I just haven't read/seen your message yet. Sorry for the long post but I just felt like I needed to say something somewhere. I hope you all have a great day and wish you all luck with your own journeys and struggles. ",1584jrm,depression
744,07-24-2023,"My mom has been planning a family vacation for three years as a retirement celebration. It was originally planned for 2020, and cancelled each year due to COVID. This year, the trip is actually set to happen this August.

I have had one injury or illness after another the last 6 months and wasn‚Äôt able to exercise- which had always been my main outlet for mental health, being in nature, and socializing while outside.

I am now experiencing moderate depression, that (in waves) is getting worse. I‚Äôve hade major/severe depression 4 times and am very scared to fall back to that space. So, I‚Äôm trying all I can to take care of myself between therapy, medication, meditation, light exercise when possible, talking with friends, trying art...
Trying to find new coping methods beyond my outdoor activities.

Anyhow, my family vacation is in one week. They typically have stressful moments, I often get in a fight with my mom. The trip is very scheduled and I‚Äôll have to really work to carve out me time. No one in my immediate family really understands depression and sometimes ties it to not trying hard enough, being lazy, and being selfish. Not the most understanding group.

At the same time, this trip is once in a lifetime with my family. My parents are both 75 & this might be one of the last trips they are healthy enough to walk around. I do enjoy time with them. My family is important to me. 

How do I decide to go or not? Have you ever gone on a family vacation while moderately or severely depressed & did it impact how bad your depression was?

754,07-25-2023,"I've been in and out of counseling over the past 10 or so years. Latest one is a brand new place, brand new counselor. Had my first session with her on Wednesday, and we encountered our first issue: me not knowing what to talk about. 

I told her, well, I dunno what to talk about (its more like idk where to even start) and she said ""ok well you need to have a list of things to talk about because I'm not gonna sit here and talk *at* you, you're gonna talk at *me* and I'm gonna listen and provide feedback here and there."" Like... ok... I guess. Its been a little bit since my last counseling session and I have bad memory so I don't exactly remember how they usually go, so fine, sure.

We get into talking about why I don't have a job yet. I'm 21, and have never worked (outside of volunteering/school ""work experience""). 

I don't remember exactly what she said (I didn't even remember it right after the appointment tbh, my adhd/memory is just that bad lol), but essentially I told her that I have this kind of... I don't even know. A ""block"" in my mind that prevents me from working? I don't have any idea what it is, but I feel like working a job is way, way too overwhelming for me (as I barely take care of myself and I leave my house maybe once a month, but theres more to it then that).

My counselor, essentially, said that she thinks half of it is me being lazy, and the other half is just anxiety. 

I really wish I remember what she said exactly. But however she said it, god it made me feel so fucking useless and like a waste of space. I started crying (phone appointment so she didnt know). She told me she wanted me to at least look at some job listings, apply to some stuff for maybe just a shift a week or something... and yeah ok that sounds reasonable. But... idk. As soon as she told me to do that, the very, *very* first thing that popped into my head was ""I would actually, legitimately rather die then go to work"". I also mentioned to her that the nearest public transportation is actually decently far from where I live, and I said ""I'd have to figure out how I'd get to a job"" and she said ""you'd take public transport like everyone else"". Which... yeah ok I know thats kinda my only option here but... fuck, idk, it just really really hurt hearing all this.

Anyway, my counselor made me feel so, so shitty with what she said that I was very suicidal for the rest of the day. I was looking up sucide methods soon after my appointment- I even found a website detailing them lol.

Half of me says thats not ok, and that I should tell my GP who referred me and switch counselors. The other half of me wants to agree with her- I ***am*** just lazy. She was just being blunt with me, and I'm just a sensitive little bitch. I'm definitely more inclined to believe the latter half of me- because honestly, its probably true.

It just... feels so shitty. I'm so pathetic that I actually was hurt by her just telling me what I needed to be told.

I talk to my GP on Thursday, and I'm having anxiety about it because I really don't know if I should tell her what happened or not. Then I'm talking to my counselor again next week and she expects me to have at least looked at job listings- probably expects that I even applied to some (or applied to one of those apps that do dog walking or smth similar like that). 

I really, really would rather just curl up into a ball and not talk or do anything lmao",158w705,depression

Her, the vibrant, fun-loving, athletic, social jokester that once was my mom.   


Back in March, my mom was hospitalized after being found catatonic in her home. At first we thought it was medical, but after a week-long assessment in the hospital, it was concluded to be severe depression. Since then, we have tried everything, and she's refused all help we've provided. 

We've tried to offer her (per the direction of professionals) talk therapy, medication changes, another round of hospitalization, and partial inpatient programs. When offered each one of these solutions, she is unwilling to try any of them. She stops going to therapy, she refuses to take her medicine, she calls the doctors in hospitals ""quacks""... 

It's been 4 months since her first hospitalization. I don't know what to do any more. At this point, I feel like I've thrown every life raft I can her way, and she won't grab them. And now I'm grieving for someone who is still alive.

I've been fighting suicidal thoughts for 13 years, trying to pretend they don't exist. I try to occupy my mind to give myself the illusion that they're not there, but I feel it, I'm slowly reaching my limit. 

Every time I've tried to talk about it, it's only ended in mockery or judgment. Such hurtful phrases as ""Are you a man?"" ""Why are you so dramatic?"" ""Stop looking for other people's attention"" ""You're complaining for nothing"". I quickly realized that no one wants to swim next to a drowning man. 

Where does this sadness come from? I could never really put my finger on it, I don't think it comes from just one thing but I think I have some clues. My abusive sister who used to beat me and humiliate me in front of her friends, the various rapes I've suffered, the vision of myself awakened by my mother's cries trying to revive my father when I was 7, my toxic love relationships (cheating, humiliation etc.) etc. etc.

All this mixed with my hypersensitivity and autism (Asperger's) make me feel like I've never been happy. I've always adapted to people by offering them the words and deeds they wanted, without ever feeling that it really came from my heart. I don't even know who or what I am, which of these masks is the real me? 

I want to die but I'm too chicken to end it so I drown myself in medication hoping it will kill me, I destroy my health and don't go to any doctor hoping it will get so bad that it's incurable, I find myself praying to God that I have an incurable disease. 

Is this what life is all about? Is this being a sad man? To be alone and helpless in the face of my malaise without being able to talk or be taken seriously? I have to be one more person who kills himself to be taken seriously? I hate them. All of them. Everyone who didn't reach out to me when I had the courage to open up. I hate this world. Why does everything have to be so hard? Does everything have to be so hard? 

I just wanted to be happy why they did this to me. I just wanted to be loved. I just needed reassurance. I just needed a shoulder to lean on when I was tired. But now it's too late, I don't have the strength anymore, I'm on autopilot and I'm heading straight for the wall.

Your mind is playing with you, when you have those good memories stored in your chrome and have some thoughts of it. You‚Äôre grateful for so much but time to time think deeply and ask if you really deserve it.
As kind as we can be and loving we get those mean and horrible moments that we try to not let inside our mind but at the end of the day just think why does it still happen?
We really try to understand so much but by learning and much more we always find that pain can be anywhere.
Pain is temporary yes but to have someone who could understand is far more better than seeing a psychologist.
It‚Äôs not that it makes you happy other than that it makes you feel valued and understood.
I don‚Äôt have a family yet but I hope so much to have one and always be a better version of myself everyday to show my creations on a later time that they are understood and loved.
Happiness is a journey.
A great long journey to live.
Ask yourself questions many of em them where at a moment given you will understand what it will take to make you happy.
Grateful is what we all are but happy?
Let me remind you when you get old and all prickly and watch behind all the pain you‚Äôve lived.
You‚Äôd be happy to see what you‚Äôve become and how far you‚Äôve made it.
Might as well add that without losing you can‚Äôt win.
I gotta say I‚Äôve lost a lot and still figuring out if I‚Äôm happy.

My therapist believed I was improved to a point where I don‚Äôt need therapy so I ‚Äúgraduated.‚Äù

My mom knew about this as I was a minor. She wanted me to stop taking my medicine. I didn‚Äôt want to stop.

It wasn‚Äôt until my aunt made a scene in public when her and my mom were out. Essentially my mom told her about my antidepressants. My aunt berated me and said they‚Äôre bad for me and to stop them. She said all teens are depressed.

So I stopped. Cold turkey.

It was dumb but I was too embarrassed. My mom began asking me everyday if I was still taking my medicine. She was pleased when I said no. So I continued not taking them.

My mom also said my psychiatrist flaked on me. I have no refills on any medication and I‚Äôm no longer seeing her.

It‚Äôs been 2 months and I feel like I‚Äôm back where I began. I want to die. I have no motivation. I feel like a failure.

789,07-24-2023,"I'm looking for some advice. My good friend is a functioning alcoholic and has been for several years. He drinks a significant amount every night. While it's been concerning, it hasn't really affected his life until recently. 

His father passed a year ago and he's been depressed ever since. He has used alcohol as a coping mechanism. A few months ago he got married and between his dad not being at the marriage and his dad's 1 year death anniversary, he's really turned down a dark path. His marriage has taken a turn for the worse, he's been late to work a few times in the past few weeks (he's never been late before in his life), he's been at the bar drinking until 1am several nights, the list goes on.

I've planning to sit down with him soon and express my concerns and offer my support. I feel like he 1) is depressed and needs medication/help and 2) needs help with his alcohol abuse. I'm no doctor but I'm assuming his issues are connected- the depression causes him to drink more, which leads to the marital issues, work issues, etc. I'm hoping that if he'll agree to professional help, he'll see improvements across the board. 

Where I need help- where do I begin? He's stubborn as hell and doesn't think he needs help. He believes his family is continually trying to give him an intervention and he just shuts down and won't talk. He is hard headed (I can relate). How do I approach a conversation with him? How do I show my concern and desire to help without him becoming immediately offensive? What do I say to him that will get past the stubbornness?

I have always dealt with what I think is avoidant tendencies fueled by social anxiety (or social ineptness) and depression. But at this point in life, it feels much, much worse. Much heavier. For a while I think the only thing that kept me going was the fact that I felt like I still had time to figure out how to deal with my mental health issues and still be able to figure out who I am, what I want, etc. But now as time just keeps passing me by, and nothing is changing, I‚Äôm feeling more and more hopeless.

I‚Äôm not asking for bunch of friends and a million stories to tell. Just want to feel human. 

But instead, I exist to work to pay for things in order to continue existing. I exist to just imagine who I could be, where I could go, what I could do. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone except my co workers, my therapist, and my parents (because yes, of course, I still live at home).

802,07-24-2023,"

I am feeling stuck right now for various reasons . I am in a very complicated place and for that matter I‚Äôm very complicated as a person. If you see any of my other posts you‚Äôll see what
 goes on with me . Right now however I am recovering from hernia surgery so I‚Äôm off from work which is good to help me recover. The job I am currently in is a crap show because of the bad hours , and this has been true since 2020. I‚Äôm looking for another job with my job coach which has steady consistent hours so I have 2 days off in a row and a better schedule so after I get off work I still have time to do other things such as the gym, meeting people etc . Anyhow I used to take pride in a lot of things in my life . I was very healthy (vegaterian) , I worked out at the gym 3 days a week and ran the other days . I took pride in my appearance by keeping my hair short , shaving mostly everyday and I was always considered handsome , I‚Äôm tall 6‚Äô1 ,  blonde hair , brown eyes , people told me I looked like a (healthy fit Southern California guy) since I love the beach , tan etc . Anyway I suffer from depression and so working out and eating healthy and being social with people distracts me from depression and along with that I take medication. However since 2020 when my hours got bad at work due to Covid and working late , having no time for the gym , and having little time for social meetup groups . I have a few friends and we do meet but it‚Äôs not as often as I‚Äôd like . So from 2020 to early part of this year I started waning a bit in terms of my diet , my appearance and stopped shaving everyday , not getting haircuts every 5 weeks or so . My parents commented the last time they saw me a few weeks ago they noticed I don‚Äôt care as much about my appearance and they sort of encouraged me to go back to that .The funny thing is during Covid i was okay with some of the changes since I was so distracted at work and couldn‚Äôt really do anything anyways because of the restrictions. However I started getting back to my normal depression pre pandemic of ‚Äú I never have a girlfriend ‚Äú, ‚Äú I‚Äôm ugly ‚Äú , ‚Äú nothing going for me , ‚Äú everyone has a social life but me ‚Äú .  
My Confidence with women has never been good . As I said earlier and in earlier posts I was a cute kid . My parents even thought of sending pictures to model . Well it was for naught and that never happened. I lost my virginity late at 19. Weird thing is I had sex with this girl but I didn‚Äôt want to be her boyfriend, than I had no luck with women period between 19 and 21, and even experimented with gay men, because I grew up in San Francisco so it was available. Obviously men did nothing for me , but I wanted to see if I had other options because clearly I was terrible with women .fast forward I had sex only once with another older woman and than finally had a girlfriend at 25. However the relationship was mostly physical and o got cold feet because she wanted to marry me and I didn‚Äôt want to , since then I‚Äôve had no actual romantic relationship with a woman , I‚Äôve had friends with benefits very spread out from each other and with older women since but few and far between. I dated a girl briefly in 2019 but it went nowhere.  For years I tried to work on myself , be more confident, secure , be positive but when you have had the bad luck I‚Äôve had you sort of start to become bitter about romance .  

I have a very weird confidence issue . I can be confident when I‚Äôm not paying attention to the whole romance issue or when I‚Äôm photographing stuff as I am a photographer. But when it comes to asking an attractive woman out I feel very nervous , not so much about the rejection part but more because I feel like the woman thinks ‚Äú what kind of creep like that dares ask me out‚Äù. While I know that‚Äôs my depression talking it makes me nervous. It‚Äôs weird because I‚Äôm mostly an extrovert and people like me apparently because I do lots of social stuff in my job .  Yet certain new social situations I feel uncomfortable and maybe I just lack confidence. I particularly feel the most vulnerable when I‚Äôm out in public by myself and I see people my age who look ‚Äú together ‚Äú and I feel I‚Äôm not .  I sometimes feel I‚Äôm either looked at as ‚Äú ugly ‚Äú , ‚Äú asexual ‚Äú , ‚Äú gay‚Äù . Not that I‚Äôm homophobic I guess it‚Äôs flattering when gay guys hit on you , I just feel like I‚Äôm too ugly to be gay lol. I‚Äôm just wondering if my problem is that on the inside I‚Äôm just not confident, and even when I have moments of being distracted by photographing or doing things I enjoy , it‚Äôs only because I‚Äôm distracted but that by nature I‚Äôm just not confident. And yet on the outside I‚Äôm mostly upbeat , positive, try to look at the good . But I wonder if women can sense I‚Äôm not confident even if I pretend like everything is okay . I‚Äôm not at my best right now and I need to change the trajectory. 

I feel like because I‚Äôm autistic it holds me back , even though I don‚Äôt look ‚Äú stereotypically autistic ‚Äú, I feel like I‚Äôll never be confident. And even though I had moments in my life where women found me attractive, I wonder if there was something wrong with the women for finding me attractive.  I try to be positive, fake my confidence but I know at the end of the day I‚Äôm ‚Äú depressed and have confidence issues. 

I live in Los Angeles and I love it here, but I think unfortunately most attractive women here are looking for ‚Äú someone with money ‚Äú, ‚Äú Uber confidence ‚Äú and ‚Äúsomeone who can‚Äôt be real‚Äù. I just figured out at this point I have so much insecurity about myself that I would never share of course , but those women don‚Äôt find me attractive because I‚Äôm just not their type , or even looked at as attractive. 

I want to get back to a positive mindset but it‚Äôs hard when like me you have just had bad luck . And I blame myself for it and not women like some incel dickhead who hates women because he is sexist pig . I just think myself I tend to think the worse because I haven‚Äôt had good luck , so when people say ‚Äú just think positive ‚Äú well if it were that easy it would be wonderful but it‚Äôs not . I guess when I have a new job with better hours and more time I‚Äôll start back at the gym , eating healthy , try to be more social. I would like to meet a woman organically and be with someone who I can be myself around just as she can be with me . I worry that I‚Äôm looked at as asexual, and that when I start working out I‚Äôll get more compliments from gay men than straight women . I know I seem so self absorbed, I‚Äôm just feeling stuck and need to better myself . I try to do self examination and work on myself but I get very frustrated with myself.

Yet I have women in my life I work with who think highly of me , and some of my biggest advocates are women , so some women  seem to respect me .",158ofky,depression

805,07-24-2023,"So...maybe you are depressed, you haven t got off the couch for 3 days now, you had to call work and pretend to be sick bcs you jud
st can t picture how you will stand up. You ve been scrolling on social media, and everybody talks about going to Starbucks, buying fancy bedding, taking bubble baths and applying expensive moisturiser as ""self care"".
 Thats great. 

But here's the thing: 
Depressed people go for weeks w/o being able to take a 5 min shower, w/o eating anything else than pbj bcs they are exhausted, or, even funnier, they don t think they deserve better. Depression presents itself with intense feelings of shame and unworthiness IN 80% OF PATIENTS. Try telling someone who doesn t believe he/she had the right to live that they should ""love themselves"", ""buy treats for themselves"" and watch how they dissapear in the next 15 seconds.

Self care doesnt have to be fancy, self love is whatever you can do at that point. It can be just rubbing your armpits with baby wipes so you get some of the smell off. It can be pushing the crumbs off your bed sheets because you cant change them. IT CAN BE the  bare minimum. And i mean the ABSOLUTE bare minimum. 

For me, the start was to clean my self harm wounds, that s how low i was. I didn t think i deserved to not get sepsis, to not get clothes stuck to my wounds. And then i kept going. I started using bandages. I started showering. I started waking up early (even tho i just stayed in bed and watched tv, but i was awake). Resuming my hobbies. Working out. And before i knew it, i was out (almost). 

Self care is IMPORTANT, but the first step to it is to understand you deserve it, we all do. I DONT GIVE A SHIT what you think of yourself, how unworthy you belive you are. DEPRESSION LIES to you, to all of us. And you don t believe you deserve love? Because you are such a horrible person?

815,07-24-2023,"Is that typical or at least normal for someone with depression to often seek novelty in things? My husband has depression (as we have recently realized) which seems like a reasonable explanation for his endless desire for moving to different places because they fast become ugly, annoying, too expensive, with wrong people around etc. Or change cars. Or need to feel ‚Äûmore‚Äú. Recently this started affecting also our relationship. He also does not feel joy from regular things, like good weather or just feeling content with life even though there are lots of reasons for it. Says that top of his emotions is when he is not annoyed. I wonder if this lust for more actually something depression-related and if someone has ever had something similar?",158meeh,depression

818,07-24-2023,"I(24M) have been running a knife across my body everyday for the past two months. Honestly, I don't know if it's bad or not. It odly feels good. Again, I know how this sounds but bear with me. I went through some stuff recently. Lost my apartment, my job, all my savings, and moved back in with my mom on my birthday. I was pretty lost, but recently I've been motivated to do all sorts of stuff. I've been hanging at the library or studying all types of stuff like math and science. I want to be a scientist and I study chemistry in school. I've been loving my motivation, but it requires me to isolate. I haven't been worried about money. I have a job, but I have bills. And not much left over to do anything outside of being inside. But all I want to do is read. Sometimes I'm in my head too much and it gives me anxiety. I don't like medication but I found someting that gets rid of the flashes of memory that just comes at me. I run a dull steak knife across my chest and legs. They leave marks but fade. Sometimes the ones on my chest leave a small mark, but not enough to cut me. It feels odly satisfying and it gives me a rush of energy and then I go about my business like nothing ever happened. I am worried about having scars and I feel guilty when I do it cause I have never told a soul, let alone my mom. I don't like the thought of medication, and I like the pain. It sounds gross and perverted but it's true. I honestly wish I was making this up, but it's been helping me get though the day. At one point I was doing it every thirty minutes to keep myself productive, but now I just do it when I need a jolt of energy. I work out, I eat healthy, my muscles have never been bigger. Just benched 120lbs dumbbells for 6 the other day and curled 70lbs in each hand. The isolation gets to me sometimes, but I would rather work on myself and my projects so I don't really care nor do I feel like Im really missing out on anything. Sure I feel like I spent my summer indoors, but I feel like I'm doing good on myself. Im just doing this cause I like it. At least that's what I think. I'm not really sure if I'm depressed or not. I'm pretty anxious to post this but I would like an outside perspective and I'm happy to answer any questions",158lw5l,depression
819,07-24-2023,"I was recently discharged from hospital, and upon discharge I started falling back on old habits. I started to think of self-harming (I haven't because given certain circumstances, it wouldn't be beneficial to do so), having thoughts of suicide, feeling apathetic and lashing out. I honestly feel like a really bad person because I get angry very easily and lash out, consequently hurting those around me and that's not what I want to do.  


I've been struggling to get out of bed, only doing so to maintain an image. It's getting to be very difficult‚ÄîI cannot do simple chores, and I can barely go up a staircase without crying. I know this is kind of pathetic, and I don't want to be annoying.   


I just get really angry and it's impacting my relationships. I don't want to be angry, and I don't want to say these things, but I do and I don't know how to control it. I don't know how to cope with it because every coping strategy I used to use, I have no energy for.

829,07-24-2023,"I don't know exactly how to articulate my feelings but I just have no will to live. I've always been really good at masking my depression - I've had it since I was 14, I'm 23 now. But lately, I've felt worse than I ever have - I never go out with my friends anymore, I don't even reply to their texts because I just physically can't bring myself to do anything other than rot in my room. My mom who calls me everyday has now started to miss days and she's said multiple times she doesn't like seeing me sad so I think that might be the reason why she's started to call less frequently. I don't blame her, I think I feel too comfortable with her so I don't bother to mask with her as much as I do with others - I don't really share the details of it, that would be cruel of me to do that to her but I'm just generally grumpy and I can't even hold a conversation with her without getting irritated and hanging up. When she asks me why I'm so sad I can't even explain why. I'm so young yet I feel like my life is a dead end. I don't see it going anywhere and I don't get excited about anything anymore. I can't watch movies, I can't read books, I can barely even function at times. Everything takes so much effort and I just feel like giving up.

I haven't experienced most of the things other people have and I just feel like my life is unfulfilling and pointless. At this point, I don't even want to experience anything, I just don't care. I wake up everyday feeling so sad and unmotivated. I truly don't know where this hopelessness comes from. I can't even remember the last time I felt joy that wasn't induced by reckless spending on things I don't need and/or food - and I don't even consider that true joy obviously. I'm not medicated because even basic access to mental health services takes over a year in the country where I live - so a diagnosis and a potential treatment is an unattainable dream for me. I can't afford private health care either, so I'm just stuck in this limbo. It's never been this persistent before. I think what triggered it this time is realizing that my life amounts to just about nothing so far and after living in delusion for many years and taking no steps to gain experience due to COVID, depression and other stuff - I feel like like I've missed my chance to work in the industry that I used to love. What used to bring me so much joy doesn't even interest me at this point. I just can't recognize myself anymore I feel so far removed from who I was/wanted to be.

I'm moving to a new city with great opportunities soon but I'm afraid I'll self-sabotage it by being my usual horrible self, plus I don't feel excited about it in the slightest. I'm not really sure it's even worth it to waste my savings as well as my parents' on this move, so I'm thinking of going back home instead but I think that might be even worse for me mentally.

Me 35m and my partner 34f are having problems because of her depression. She is feeling thai way since 2-3 years. We are in committed relationship, but we don't live together. 
In the last few months she wanrs to spend and less time together, we only see each other once every week or every 2 weeks. Every proposal from my end to do anything fun, get out of the house, gets knocked  down with a 'we'll see' or 'I am not in the mood'. Marriage and kida do come up regulary and we seem to be on the same page during these talks. We already looked at houses to buy and our financial situation is very good, so no problems there. 

Now here comes the sour spot: some time off from job is coming up (because of national holidays being linked) and we talked about doing something for a couple of days, but no concrete plans (because of the 'we'll see' answers). Now I stressed the issue again, and told her I feel bad thay we don't get to enjoy anything, and that I cannot wait for us to reconnect in those few days we will be away, it really does not matter to me where we go, what we do, as long as she is there and we are together. I would love for us just to spend those 3 days together, ar my place or hers, just coking and living it up like a couple. 

Her reply to this was that she just wants to be alone,  just stay at home alone all day. And she said that me telling her that only puts even more pressure on her and an extra expectation from this upcoming holiday that we will do x or y. 

I am really pactient person, I try to undersrand and not judge her. This is really hard for me, it seems that depression is making us drift apart and I am worried about her and her feelings :( she is pushing me away, writes only monsilabic answers to texts, it seems all excitement and pleasure of life is not there for her :( I am really scared and I feel hopeless.

848,07-24-2023,"My partner wants to commit suicide, she has for the past 6 or more months and in general never saw herself live past the age of 20. She doesn't want to finish uni because of the immense pressure of her field and general dissapointment, but if she left her parents would either disown her or never get off her ass about it. Not to mention that she'd have to pay a big fee for quiting since she joined as a government covered student 
So she took and academic holiday as a mental health break and has been working the past month. She has no other interests that she could study and make a career of and she's completely burnt out of her life goal interest.
So she thinks she'll work dead-end jobs for the rest of her life (and statistically that is the case for most ppl basically regardless of education). She doesn't want to give her life to the capitalist machine for the next 40-50 years, because it'll make her even more depressed, so she believes it's better to just end it all now.
I've tried to get her to go a psychologist or psychotherapist or whatever they're called, but she says it won't change the reality of her life so nothing will change.
And to be honest if I wasn't afraid of death and (I'll be honest) a bit idealistic, I would probably agree and take my own life because of this sooner or later.

Mind you don't go critisizing her, I can't represent her exact thoughts there's probably things I got wrong but the fact to the matter remains. I need help to keep her from commiting suicide when she doesn't think it can get any better. When we talk about it I freeze up and don't know what to tell her and I hate myself for it

I‚Äôve suffered depression on and off for 4 years. I‚Äôm 29 now and originally started during Covid. 9 months of therapy later I‚Äôd identified the issue (suppressed trauma during childhood that reared it‚Äôs head during Covid ‚Äòdowntime‚Äô) and have been ok ever since. Some good days and some back, but nothing to write home about. 

3 weeks ago it all came back. General ‚Äògreyness‚Äô and lack of enjoyment in life of things I previously loved, music sounds dull and all food tastes the same. Also this time there is some harmful thoughts and real hopelessness, and interestingly I seem to be much more numb. Not really feeling hungry / sleepy and I lose track of time because nothing ‚Äòfeels‚Äô different. 8am feels no different to 8pm. 

Reached back out to my old therapist today to get sessions back in but I‚Äôm worried that this time is different. Last time I had the ‚Äòsmoking gun‚Äô clarity of realising the childhood suppression, but I know that can‚Äôt be the case this time. 

I‚Äôm happily married, in a good job, secure house, happy life etc etc but I don‚Äôt care about anything. 

Anyway, not really asking for anything but does anybody else get numbness to the point of losing time?

860,07-24-2023,"In recent times, I have been navigating through a series of challenges that have impacted various aspects of my life. I'd like to share these experiences with you to help you understand how I've been feeling lately.


1. Academic Struggles and Overwhelm:
- I have been facing challenges in my academic journey, feeling overwhelmed by the continuous cycle of learning each year.
- Due to the challenges, I've had to repeat a year of college, leading to additional pressure and feelings of inadequacy.
- The prospect of facing repeated exams to pass the course and the fear of potential academic setbacks have intensified my stress and anxiety.

2. Missed Opportunities and Feeling Disconnected:
- The onset of COVID-19 disrupted my late teens and early 20s, causing me to miss out on significant life experiences and social connections.
- As a result, I sometimes feel like I've lost valuable time in my youth, leading to a sense of disconnection from my peers and the world around me.

3. Lack of Motivation and Restlessness:
- I often find myself lacking motivation, feeling a sense of restlessness, and struggling to find purpose in my daily activities.
- My current path feels monotonous, and I yearn for opportunities to explore my passions and discover new interests outside of academic demands.

4. Uncertainty About the Future:
- The pressure to make long-term decisions about my education and career path has left me feeling uncertain and anxious about the future.
- I desire clarity on my true aspirations and how to align them with my interests and abilities.

5. Coping Mechanisms and Isolation:
- To cope with my emotions, I tend to retreat to my phone, online communities, and entertainment as a way to find solace and laughter.
- However, this has resulted in a sense of isolation and a disconnection from the outside world, hindering personal growth and interpersonal connections.


I am sharing these feelings and experiences, including the challenge of repeating a year of college and the possibility of facing repeated exams, to provide insight into the complexities of my current situation. This academic setback has further contributed to my emotional struggles and sense of overwhelm.

The slightest inconvenience sends me into panic and despair mode. I have to see a doctor in a few weeks or even months because of something else and i already feel like throwing up because of it. The reason for the needed appointment isn't anything serious, it's just some mundane thing and i'm not particularly scared of seeing a doctor. I'm just scared of pretty much anything at this point. It's the thought of having to go outside and interact with other people that already has me panicing, unable to think straight. I know i'll get this particular appointment done eventually as there will probably be a lot of continuous pain that will push me to see the doctor, but i can't imagine how i could get anything else done. I have no idea how i should manage to get treatment for my mental problems as that isn't solved with just a simple doctors visit and even if it could, i'd still be too scared to do it if im not pushed to do it by pain that prevents me from sleeping every night. I can't even make a call, but am supposed to go to multiple appointments if i want help with my mental problems? I'm convinced i need some kind of stationary treatment as it can't realistically work any other way, but obviously that needs to be arranged as well, that means, again, multiple doctors visits and then at some point actually going into the clinic, when even calling a doctor to initiate this process it way too much for me to handle. A common and logic suggestion are video calls instead of in person appointments, but those are even worse as i can't speak openly at home, so those would still seem impossible to achieve and on top be totally useless.
And then, if there is no 'special' thing to cause me to loose my mind, then there's the extreme loneliness, while not feeling much better i can still hold the illusion of finding people online alive, what makes it somewhat easier to endure, even if it's just an illusion.

Email to my therapist tonight:

‚ÄúThoughts for our next session this week: knowing and interacting with loads of people but feeling alone constantly, imposter syndrome? Knowing people generally like me but can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt connect with me like they do others. Feeling like I‚Äôm just ‚Äúthere‚Äù in interactions but always feeling like I‚Äôm riding the line of being inner/outer circle or like I‚Äôm wanted.

He is a great therapist and feel confident he can talk me through this later this week, but wondering if imposter syndrome fits what I said? Or is this just being depressed?‚Äù

After hitting an hour without a single response, commented this on my post:

My upbringing wasn‚Äôt much to really look back on sadly, I do remember bits and pieces of it, not much substantial, My pre teen years were awful, My family had a falling out with my Mothers Mom(My grandma) I like to think things would‚Äôve been different had I not overnight basically lost someone who was in my life substantially the past 9 years of sentient like(being about 12/13) And I guess when my Grandfather passed away a couple months ago it could‚Äôve reopened this wound but this isn‚Äôt why I‚Äôm on here today.

897,07-24-2023,"I have battled depression for a long time - my family was fine as a kid, excluding my dad occasionally being mean to us. I would say though it wasn't *too* significant, but maybe it plays into my current day struggles ever so slightly...but doubtful, to be honest. (Just wanted to say this to give background info of my childhood).

I find myself fighting depression so hard, and I've noticed somewhat of a pattern with it. The foggy mornings I have where I'm getting ready for work - causes depression and dread. Why is it that this affects me so much? Rainy days actually don't bother me as much, perhaps they give off a cozy vibe?

The smells of the big city I work in - instantly causes me great negativity and I can filled with depressive thoughts. 

The smell of the elevator - again, causes dread.

The aesthetic of the office - again, depression.

People dressed up in business attire, walking around in a hurry - brings me down as well.

And then there are things such as meetings. I'll get super anxious over them, even if I know exactly what they'll be about and what I'll say. I'll still lose my mind. Or, even if I don't have to say anything at ALL, I'll still be incredibly anxious and fragile. Every Teams message I get, I instantly assume it's directed at me and that I've done something wrong or someone has ulterior motives. I constantly think people are trying to fire me or something like that.

I don't understand what this is. Why do smells, the environment, the way people dress and talk, etc. all cause me so much depression?

901,07-24-2023,"Every time in my life that I'm happy, every. Single. Time. Something happens to destroy it.

Most recently I decided that I was going to buy myself some pokemon cards with some of the money I inherited from my grandma since I used to play pokemon there with my cousins growing up and it was my favorite part of being there. Literally 1 day after they arrive they're sitting on my desk and for the first time ever my gf's dog decides she wants my tea. I've had this tea dozens of times around this dog, the dog has never shown even the slightest interest at all. I get back from the bathroom and not only are the cards all soaked in tea and destroyed, my brand fucking new laptop that I was only able to pay for because of student aid is also sitting in a puddle of tea. I picked it up and tea just poured out of it so that's fucking dead. I wasted my inheritance and I can't even go back to school. Shit this bad happens to me like every few days. If anything makes me even stop hurting even 0.01% then it gets destroyed in a way that makes it hurt even worse than if nothing had happened. 

I've lost track of the number of times I've tried to hang myself over the last 20 years and every time something happens. Either the rope breaks, the thing I tied the rope to breaks, or my feet end up hitting the floor (I'm tall). I can't bring myself to jump off a building or in front of a vehicle because I'm already gross enough, nobody should have to clean up my body as it is, let alone if it's in bits and pieces after an accident. Plus there's no guarantee it would work, it would probably just permanently disable me and make things even worse.

I've never had friends really. There were 3 people in my life who I felt like I was truly friends with. The first one died of a brain aneurysm when she was 19 (literally no history of it in her entire family going back as far as they had records, which is only up tonher grandparents, but still). The other one went on disability from work around the same time I did and despite reaching out a couple times a month for over a year, she's stopped responding. The only other person is my mom.

I mentioned my gf. Shortly after we started dating my work have me an ultimatum, quit or go on disability. I had started having seizures which came with memory loss. I was forgetting how to do almost all of my job and the parts I remembered I was doing wrong. Couple that with the emotionally instability that comes from not knowing where you are or what's going on most of the time and I almost don't blame them. Of course I later found out that it was the stress they were putting on me that was the most likely cause of the seizures. But either way, the end result is that I'm making 40% of an already unlivably low wage. So out of necessity I moved in with my gf and it was pretty shortly after that we started fighting. A lot. Like every day for a while. Especially after I got bottom surgery and couldn't even help out with the house.

Oh yeah, I'm also trans, which is the reason my only family I have to talk to is my mom. My dad, sister, and extended family have problems with it. Also, bottom surgery was a fucking nightmare and will have lifelong complications. Which I was assured is an incredibly rare outcome. Unlucky me I guess.

I have no friends, I have no family, I have no job, I'm unhappy in my relationship and I can't find a way out. I've tried killing myself and it doesn't work, I've tried finding things to make me happy but they end up hurting me more in the end. I can't even eat my feelings because since turning 30 I've had a harder and harder time with dairy. Chocolate milk is my absolute favorite thing in the entire world and I can't have it anymore because my body failed me. Yesterday I had what was supposed to be a safe dish but the restaurant used margarine. Did you know even fake butter has dairy? I didn't. Imagine not being able to just have a piece of cheese as a snack, or not being able to eat ice cream when you're sad. Not being able to have the best drink on the planet.

All that's left for me is suffering and pain but I can't do anything about it. I can't kill myself, I can't make myself happy, I can't eat my feelings, and I can't even afford a vice to distract me. I just have to sit here, alone, and suffer. It's unbearable but I can't do anything about it.",15820rd,depression

I distinctly remember my mom crying violently when I was 6 and me trying to console her.

After I left my school I got severely depressed but had to continue to ‚Äúmake something of myself‚Äù. At 18 I started living in a different country for school because that would mean a better life for me and my family. Since the beginning of university I just watched my mental health going down the drain, working part time to pay rent, going to classes. By the time I would come home I would just completely shut down looking at videos not taking in any of it or feeling like a TV show was more real than my life. Eventually I started a cycle of barely passing courses my depression got worse and worse I would tell my family that I need time to feel okay but that would mean that I wouldn‚Äôt finish my degree in time.

920,07-24-2023,"Maybe my understanding of depression is incorrect, but it seems when I'm depressed I have trouble feeling emotion. I can't cry, be angry, or do much of anything, really, even outside of emotional things. I wish I could just cry. I constantly feel unsettled, like something is very wrong inside of me, but I can't have any emotion about it. Maybe it's because I've talked about all my problems that I can with family and in therapy, and I'm left with the problems I can't talk about. Drugs, crime, and sexual stuff that's happened. I feel like I don't want to get emotional about those things because I don't want people to ask ""what's wrong"" and not be able to say what it is. How do I not be so fucking numb without exposing myself? Even when I'm alone, I'm paranoid (not in a schizophrenic way; just insecure, I guess). I never feel truly alone, I feel as though somebody could burst in at any moment and ask why I'm crying, even though it doesn't make sense. I live life as though I'm being watched almost all the time.",157ypbu,depression
921,07-24-2023,"not sure why but it feels like after summer started and school stopped ive felt like life has moved by more slowly. I dont really have any friends, the ones I do I rarely talk to and we dont really have a deep connection or anything. so not having really much in life I mostly stay inside now, actually now thinking about it I rarely ever go outside lol.

so sometimes I feel like if I would spend time on doing something for 30 minutes that 30 minutes would feel like 1 hour, and sometimes 1 day can even feel like 2 days. I would ask my mom ""what day is it today?"" and she would give ""its sunday"" even tho I feel like its tuesday",157ykyz,depression
922,07-24-2023,"Recently, I was diagnosed with severe depression, which has significantly impacted my ability to cope with the demands of university life. Regrettably, I had to leave the second semester far beyond the deadline for filing leave of absences. While my papers are being processed for the leave, I have decided to take half a year off from university to prioritize my mental health and seek the professional help I need.  
  
However, I find myself filled with uncertainty and fear about the decision I have made. Being an academic overachiever for most of my life, it is difficult to face the reality that my previous successes seem distant now. I had been on track to graduate next year, but my current situation makes that goal uncertain. I received failing grades for the first time in 20 years, and it is hard to dissociate my self-worth from these numbers. I feel lost, not recognizing the person I once was when I look in the mirror.  
  
Throughout my time at university, I was actively involved in extracurriculars and community activities, aware of the networking opportunities and grad school scholarships that could have been available to me. Now, I worry that taking time off might jeopardize those chances, and I fear that I have tarnished my record irreparably.  
  
My aspirations have always been significant, particularly in helping others, but my motivation has waned drastically. Even the thought of work triggers panic attacks, making it challenging to engage with essential tasks like checking emails or accessing school resources.  
  
I am in a state of confusion and struggle to articulate my feelings properly. This overwhelming sense of failure and falling behind in life is profoundly distressing. I am at a crossroads and unsure whether to proceed with the leave or enroll despite my current mental state.  
  
Moreover, the financial strain of therapy and the well-being of my aging parents weigh heavily on my mind. The fact that I am the firstborn daughter adds an extra layer of pressure and sadness when I think about not achieving what they had hoped for my graduation which was supposed to be next year.  
  
This emotional breakdown is unfamiliar territory for me, and I long to regain my sense of self and purpose. I know that seeking help and support is crucial, but I feel paralyzed by fear.  
  
I am reaching out to you in the hope that you might offer some advice or suggestions on how to move forward during this difficult period. Your guidance would mean the world to me.

TLDR: In this message, the writer discusses their recent diagnosis of severe depression and the challenges they are facing with their education. They are contemplating taking half a year off from university due to the overwhelming stress and are seeking help to cope with their situation. They express feelings of fear, uncertainty, and a loss of motivation for their academic and personal goals. The writer is torn between taking time off and potentially missing out on opportunities, while also worrying about the financial implications of their therapy and their family's well-being. They seek advice on what steps to take next in their life journey.",157ycvc,depression
923,07-24-2023,"Like all my life i have lived in constant fear. When I was in school I had  Fear of not doing academically well. Constantly thinking about future and having anxiety. I always have a feeling that I am not enough. I never learned how to be happy. And I hate myself so much that I can't even tell you.

924,07-24-2023,"I have, on the whole, a pretty good life. I have a good job where I can just work 9 - 5 and clock out. I have no debts and enough savings to last me quite a while. I don't really have any health issues - I'm not in good shape, but I'm not in bad shape either. I'm on decent terms with my family - I won't really get any emotional support from them, but they will step up to help in any crisis. I'm not dating anyone, but I've never had any desire to, either. I have friends that I'm reasonably close to and in touch with.

Despite all this, I have this feeling of not really wanting to exist. Like, there isn't anything that I really want out of life, and I'm going to die someday anyway, so... What's even the point?

Of course, I don't really want to kill myself, and I don't really want to experience the horror of dying slowly while bedridden (have seen some close family members go this way). And I have books to read and games to play, and I can do those things, so I'm fine and these feelings can just be ignored.

Recently, a short stressful period at work (I'm talking about 2 weeks in a multi year relaxed job) has brought these feelings more into the foreground and I'm not really sure what to do about it.

I don't even feel like I have the right to complain because there are so many people who feel this way, but they have actual legitimate reasons to do so (financial crises, personal tragedies) and I don't have anything like that.",157xu4i,depression

928,07-24-2023,"July has been the month from hell for my depression. I've been suicidal nearly every weekend (for some odd reason Saturdays are the WORST) and it results in me staying in bed all weekend long without eating, drinking water, taking my meds, and isolating myself. Last night I was supposed to go see the Barbie movie with my besties and dress up then have a sleep over but I ended up bailing and staying in bed. I cried all weekend and was suicidal and nearly self-harmed but my mom hid anything sharp. My friends texted me BEGGING me to come out and eventually resulted in them calling me ""shitty"". It really hurt and made me realize that maybe my closest friends are over me and my depression. It just made me spiral even more and feel even worse. It's absolutely understandable for them to be upset and frustrated with me and I appreciate them being honest and blunt but I feel like such a burden anymore.

I just don't know what to do, my wife and I were good, were neutral on things and somehow I just don't know where did things falloff, I feel like my wife is undermining me, we're currently struggling financially, heavily struggling, she doesn't do a thing, she always say that she's tired of kids of life, even tired of me (in romance, you know sexy time?) I know I've been working 8 to 10hrs a day and sometimes I have to take care of kids as she's tired or was not able to sleep coz of the baby. I just don't know what to do, you may say I'm afraid to crack the egg on this things as I know I hate heavy confrontation.

I don‚Äôt want to believe this; it‚Äôs only the logical conclusion of a lifetime of failure. Examples:

Friendship: I can‚Äôt make friends or be liked. For almost two decades I‚Äôve done all the standard friendship making strategies. I‚Äôve attended classes, joined clubs that share my interests, volunteered, gone to Meetups, etc., but nothing has worked. I wish I knew why I‚Äôm unlikable besides being autistic, but even after 20 years of therapy I still have no idea what I‚Äôm doing wrong. All I know is that I‚Äôm unlikeable. 

Family: They will never like or care about me. 

Jobs: I‚Äôm incapable of getting a good job I can be proud of doing. I seem destined to work terrible, dead-end, soul-crushing jobs the rest of my life. I‚Äôve been to college, done unpaid internships, hired career coaches, networked, all those things I‚Äôm supposed to do, but none of it has helped. Nobody can tell me what I‚Äôve done wrong. All I know is that there is something inherently flawed about me that makes it impossible to get a good, respectable job in my field. 

Body: All the abuse and stress of my terrible jobs has wrecked me physically. On the one hand, I gained a ton of weight from being on five antidepressants simultaneously. On the other hand, I‚Äôve developed a digestive disorder and an eating disorder due to stress. What this means is that I‚Äôm fat at the same time I refuse to eat solid foods because it‚Äôs the only means to control my otherwise uncontrollable diarrhea. No doctor, dietitian, personal trainer, or other professional seems to have any solutions to this.

In my last appointment he pretty much gave me an ultimatum: to do some of his recommendations or else not continue because he felt like Im thinking Im smarter than everyone and he feels disrespected for not doing the work. Honest, I havent done some things because I fear I will get into deeper trouble. It mostly come down to being assertive in my social relationships, which as mostly at work. One is a girl that stopped talking to me like she used to, so my therapist said I should tell her my needs, and how I feel when she ignores me. I wanted a relationship with her but I learned its not a good fit, plus I dont trust her enough to talk to her like that and then she complains about me to HR. Another is a coworker who's a douche. He says to tell my coworker that I feel disrespected etc etc... but I feel it will bring me unwanted confrontation. Last one is my mother. At my 37 years old I cant be assertive with her because she has it in her head that she's the mother so she cant be wrong. My therapist tells me to tell her how distant and hurt I am with her, but I know she wont listen to that, and will end up in more arguments along with passive aggressive attitude. I explain all these things  but my therapist says theyre excuses to not do the work to improve and that makes him feel disrespected by me. I never want to do that to anyone and im always worried im projecting something I dont want, which in his cases appears to be true. 

What should I do? I could try some things if I know I wont lose my job or get in worse situations. But I hate being cornered like this, and I dont like that sink or swim threat.

2. I go low. My sleep cycle rides off to who knows where, I‚Äôm tired, unfocused, and I mess up a lot. I stop talking to people because it's too hard to hold a conversation, it's too demanding to do anything really.
3. The exhaustion catches up and I sleep all the time. Weeks go by and eventually, I gather some energy back. The friends that I still have left welcome me back, they‚Äôre a bit weirded out by the sudden change, but no one feels like questioning it.
4. ‚ÄúI beat it!‚Äù I‚Äôm having fun. I‚Äôm out partying, enjoying almost every minute.

One sigh from a family member. One small thing.
5. Doubt settles in. I fight it, but self-awareness has taken over in full force. I realize how awkward I am. How clumsy, ugly, useless, dumb, and disgusting I am. I deserve to be alone because I hurt everyone who gets just a bit closer.
6. I want it to end. I fully realize how awful I am and how everyone would be better off without me. I think about it every second. I think about how to make them realize it too, so that they could move on without any fuss. I write notes, I'm hostile, I'm angry and crying all the time. I want to live.

959,07-23-2023,"This post is going to touch on a couple sensitive topics such as drug dependency, depression, and suicidal ideation. Around January my depression just started becoming more and more severe and I wanted a way to escape from reality without having to see a therapist or get any prescription medication. I would be up very late and would wake up multiple times throughout the night as well. My first thought as a way of escaping reality was to sleep more. I discovered Unisom which is an OTC sleeping aid so I didn‚Äôt think it could do any harm considering anyone can easily purchase it. I would take one a night and it would knock me out until 10-11 am the next day if I didn‚Äôt set an alarm. Over the course of a couple weeks I noticed the tiny blue pill wouldn‚Äôt put me to sleep as fast as it did when I first started taking it. I started upping the dose to 2 pills, then 3 then even tried 6 at a time. One time it put me asleep for nearly an entire day but I didn‚Äôt mind it. I liked that it kept me out for so long considering all I wanted to do was escape reality. It made me super irritable and groggy throughout the day and all I thought about was taking them at night so I can sleep for a long time. Pretty sure it made me even more depressed. This was a habit that continued for months. During this time I had taken a few hydros I hadn‚Äôt used from an operation and even took multiple in a night and thought I was about to overdose. I also tried blow at a party and liked the euphoric feeling it gave me and how all my sadness disappeared while on it. 
I told my boyfriend about my Unisom dependence and he obviously didn‚Äôt approve and told me to stop taking them. I stopped taking them and noticed I was a lot more energetic and could focus on things a lot better. But recently, I think my depression has reached an all time low recently as I‚Äôve had to focus a lot more on my future considering I‚Äôm an 18 year old pre-med student and have a lot of serious things ahead of me. I started taking Unisom again so that I can fall asleep earlier and won‚Äôt have to think about things while laying in bed for hours. I‚Äôve even started researching ways I can get stronger prescriptions without seeing a therapist and dealing with the whole process of getting them. My biggest worry is fentanyl poisoning because it‚Äôs a current major issue from getting pills through other means. I tried blow a few more times recently and still enjoy the euphoria it gives me. I‚Äôm worried on what I‚Äôll do next. What I will take just to help me avoid my thoughts and escape reality. I keep asking myself what quality of life do I have if I am relying on substances for the tiniest bit of relief now and if there‚Äôs any point in continuing it. I just worry about my family having to deal with the mess if I ended it. Idk i just needed a place to vent.",157txax,depression

This is just my experience, I don't mean to paint people with ed's or depressiom in a negative light. I just want to exore how fucked up and similar they both are

1.  My illness keeps me safe
- ed: my illness prevents me from becoming fat, losing control and the moral wrongs associated with that
- depression: my illness allows me to see the real world, I am closed off emotionally so I cannot be hurt

2. My illness gives me an identity
- ed: I my illness make me a dedicated, active person, I am a part of a community, I understand things normal people don't. 
- depression: my illness gives me an emotional depth and sense of humour no one else has

3. I would not be a better person if I recovered
- ed : my illness tells me no one woud love me as a fat person
- depression: my illness tells me without depression I would be delusional, blind to rhe real world.

4. I do not deserve to recover / I am not sick enough
- ed: my illness tells me am not thin enough or unwell enough. My illness tells me this is my choice. 
-depression: my illness tells me I am doing this for attention, it tells me if I was serious I would have killed myself already.

5. I am special
- ed: my illness tells me most people need good and rest but I am special, my body is broken, my metabolism is broken.
- depression: my illness tells me I will never be happy. Some people can be happy but I am not one of them.

977,07-23-2023,"I've adapted the idea that once things get overwhelming to just figure  out feelings internally and until  I'm capable  of communicating in a controlled state,  let's just say it's a work in progress. But for a larg portion  of my life I've been  able to read people and figure what they are about in the moment but the habit  of people  pleasing runs a lil deeper than  I realize, the feelings of ending  myself and feeling worthless  have been replaced with the desire to find ways to rid my experience of things that inspire  those feelings,  like being broke or unlucky  can be cured with acquired success. Making myself  useful to participate  in the goals  I have in mind, rather  than wondering  why things don't work out, find the missing  pieces and relentlessly move to acquire them. This experience so far has taught  me that  I'm not hopeless , just sensitive to things that are raw in my mind, from the constant  picking with no action. The ideas we create  to solve our query can only  be activated thru action. So it may take time to muster  up the energy or confidence, but once you make that decision that it's not always happening, and you you have room to breathe, no matter  how small take the opportunity to grow and create space between  you and your doubts even  if it's just to spite those lingering thoughts of self hatred.

I promise  your not suppose to be feeling  that attached  to things that are in constant  fluctuation.

984,07-23-2023,"My name is Matthew, I'm 17, slightly fit, but I feel depressed. I don't really know where it was actually started, it just sort of happened. I mean I know what contributed to it. My grandma died long ago (my dads bio mom),my grandpa died years ago (my moms side) soon after that a close family friend, then my my other grandma died (my dad's step mom), another family friend gone, and most recently and the worst one I think, my godfather. Anyone who has a god father know that it's more than just an uncle who's name your godfather, they are more of your closest friend, who can watch a show together, hang at the bonfire, or drive you back from school when your parents are too busy. He was 46. He had cancer, terminal, not sure what it was, I think brain cancer tho. He died 3-4 months ago not from the cancer directly, he was getting treatment, chemo and radiation, I think he did it to stick around for my cousins graduation. In April I think, it was the morning, my mom got a call from my godmother, saying that he won't go to the hospital and she need help convincing him because he has trouble breathing and they couldn't call an ambulance because they'd take him to a hospital they don't want him to go to, they wanted him taken to a better one. Anyway I convince my mom to let me come with her. Time goes by etc etc. We eventually get there and we can't get him out of the hallway (we'd had already gotten him out of bed) he's too heavy and I can't carry him. None of us can. My cousin he's the strongest and he couldnt pick him up either. I do powerlifting and I pride myself in that but I couldnt pick him up and I'll remember that for the rest of my life. We call 911 get him an ambulance or whatever they were. They take him to the hospital we didn't want him taken to. But later into the day he gets taken to a far better hospital. That night they intubate him. A week later he died, his life support was the only thing keeping him alive so my aunt, mom, and godmother made the decision. I didn't feel much when it happened like how your body protects you when you feel too much emotions. It then hit me at the fundraiser for the funeral services I broke down horribly and my 2 cousins saw me and helped me up. Talked me through it that night. The day of the viewing was painful and the actual funeral was honestly the worst. I wanted to actually just fall and cry as they buried him. It only got worse from there about 2 months ago I actually started to feel sad, depressed even, i struggled to do a lot of things. It got worse over the course of time, about a month ago I wanted to kill myself, I held a knife to my wrist twice since then. I didn't do anything so I guess that's good. I think the actual thought of killing myself is worse than actually holding a knife to my wrist.
