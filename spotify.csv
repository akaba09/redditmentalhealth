depression,trueplaylistsforeb,2019/07/08,"This is how music will help you to get happier again 🌺 Hello Guy's and Girls,

I want to talk about how music can get you through tough phases of life and want to share an exciting experiment with you all to help you feel happy again.

Music is one of the most underrated tools against many problems. Depending on how we feel or how we want to feel we listen to music to put ourselves in the mood or state of mind we want be in. 

E.g. I listen to sad music when I'm feeling down and I listen to Lo-Fi or piano music for concentrating while studying. 

However, that's not it yet. Music changes our feelings too!! I'm sure most of you have already listened to sad music although you were feeling happy?! The result: Slowly you feel a bit melancholic and eventually even sad. The problem is that it strangely doesn't work the other way around (for me), so I asked my childhood friends from ''Ivanova Playlists'' to create two playlists with sad songs which constantly get happier and happier throughout the playlist. That way you don't force yourself to be happy when you're feeling depressed. Besides that, you give yourself some time to get better in a natural way.

Because we all tend to listen to different genres I will add two links for two different Spotify playlists to this post and I truly hope this experiment will help you. Please let me know if it worked out well!!

PS: I apologize if there are a few spelling mistakes in this post. I am not a native English speaker.
