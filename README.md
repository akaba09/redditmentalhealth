# Project: Mens Mental Health through the lens of Data Science
This project takes inspiration from the pioneering work of Low, D. M., Rumker, L., Torous, J., Cecchi, G., Ghosh, S. S., & Talkar, T., as presented in their study titled ["Natural Language Processing Reveals Vulnerable Mental Health Support Groups and Heightened Health Anxiety on Reddit During COVID-19: Observational Study"][https://www.jmir.org/2020/10/e22635/] published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR), volume 22, issue 10. Their study provided valuable insights into using natural language processing to analyze distinct and critical gaps in the discourse regarding men's mental health during times of humanitarian insecurities. The datasets used in their study can be accessed [here][https://zenodo.org/record/3941387#.ZJRTV-zMJoY].

## Problem Statement
In the context of humanitarian crises, conflicts, and violence, there exists a noticeable lack of discourse surrounding men's mental health and victimhood. While substantial attention has been directed towards addressing the mental well-being of women and children in such challenging circumstances, there is an alarming lack of research and discourse centered on the mental health struggles and experiences of men. This gap in understanding and acknowledgment raises significant concerns about the holistic well-being of all individuals affected by humanitarian insecurities.

To bridge this knowledge gap and gain insights into the nuanced experiences of men as victims in times of crisis, conflict, or violence, it's important to leverage digital platforms such as Reddit, specifically focusing on subreddit discussions related to depression. Reddit is a popular platform for sharing personal experiences with majority of their users being male, including struggles with mental health, making it a valuable resource for examining how men express their vulnerabilities and experiences in times of humanitarian instability like the pandemic(Covid-19). 

## Data
For the data I primarily utilized the depression datasets provided in the study. I focused on two distnict datasets, namely [pre][https://zenodo.org/record/3941387/files/depression_pre_features_tfidf_256.csv?download=1] and [post][https://zenodo.org/record/3941387/files/depression_post_features_tfidf_256.csv?download=1] pandemic. 

* Pre-Pandemic Dataset: This dataset covers the period from December 2018 to December 2019, offering insights into discussions on depression before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

* Post-Pandemic Dataset: The post-pandemic dataset encompasses the time frame from January 1 to April 2020, a period marked by the initial impact and response to the pandemic.
